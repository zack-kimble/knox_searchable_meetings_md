| 0:06:51| It doesn't happen very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| So your primary business is on-site sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| On-site sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| Before we proceed further, are there questions from the commission on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| Ma'am, you realize that having an on and off, and though it's legal, if you're going to just have a tavern, it's probably, I hate to discourage you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=422)|
| 0:07:11| but giving a drunk guy a six-pack is probably not a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| I wouldn't sell it to a drunk guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| Are you selling it to somebody that might have one or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| Well, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| I would ask you, and I can't tell you to, and I can't tell you I won't vote for it if you don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| but I would rather you just have an on-premise only, if you're just mainly operating as a bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| Is that what you're going to be doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| I would feel more comfortable with that, but it's your business and you can do what you want to with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| I think you ask for more liability than you gain by selling a couple six-packs to a guy that's had a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| You know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| Well, usually the only ones that ask for a six-pack is people that we've known for years and we know, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=466)|
| 0:07:53| if they're to their limit, we wouldn't sell to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| Well, two and then a six-pack on the way home is your limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| You know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| I'm just asking you to, I would rather you reconsider and just do on-premise only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=480)|
| 0:08:06| But, again, it's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| We just approved one here not too many months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| It was only for on-premises, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| This has not been on and off before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| Well, Ms. Poe says it was, so I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| I mean, if on-premises is all we need to get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| You think it was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| I think Gordon Casey just had the on-premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| Ma'am, can you speak into the microphone, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| I think Gordon Casey just had on-premises, but I think when Bill Poe had it, they did sell six-packs to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=520)|
| 0:08:48| So I'm not sure, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| I mean, if on-premises is the best, then that's what we'll just go with the on-premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| Well, I would feel more comfortable that, like Commissioner Andrews just said, you know, we're having a lot of problems, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=535)|
| 0:09:04| with people getting them, taking them, running somebody off the road or killing somebody on the way home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=544)|
| 0:09:11| So if it's all right with you, I would make the motion to approve on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| Would you like to amend your application, ma'am, to on-premises only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| Do you own the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| And who owns the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| Jeannie Poe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=564)|
| 0:09:25| And you'll be leasing from her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| Does anybody else have an interest in the business besides you and the gentleman with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| Who's going to operate the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| Well, he works all the time, so it would be me and Donnie Woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=575)|
| 0:09:40| He used to work there before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| And Ms. Poe may be up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| She just wanted to be able to come in there and sit or work or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| I told her that was fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| I mean, she's a 75-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| Why couldn't she do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| Are you aware that regardless of who works there, they're going to have to have server training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| They both do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| Have you had the server training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| And the gentleman with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| He doesn't have it yet, but we'll get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| I'm now going to defer to our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| Health Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| Pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| Pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| Beer Board Inspector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| Anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| Mr. Childress is going through the certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| Codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| Fire Marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| I'll defer to the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| Yes, for the Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| What are we pending for, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| The Health Inspector tried to get in contact with the owner and could not, and so he needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=627)|
| 0:10:36| to go out there for a final inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| Move the microphone over for her, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| A final inspection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| A final inspection for the application, and they have to come to the Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| and pay their fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| But this license would not be approved until that's done, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| That's your policy, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| No, we don't have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| You made a motion, didn't you, Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| Yes, to approve on premise only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| I'll make a motion pending the Health Department's final inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| And the gentleman getting his certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| Is that for both on and off, or just on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| Just on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| And the license affidavit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| We've got three addendums to go with this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| Ma'am, I appreciate you changing your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| Number 6C has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| We have one other item, Mr. Chairman, that's not on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| Wolfie, would you come forward, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| What about the consideration of the name changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| They haven't come in, have they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| They are not in the audience, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| Do you want to explain to the commission your concerns relative to illegal gambling machines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| In the past couple of years, Lieutenant Brown and myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| we've confiscated probably well over 100 illegal gambling machines in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=723)|
| 0:12:11| All of these machines have come from places that have a beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=731)|
| 0:12:17| Most of them are behind locked doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| If they don't know you or if you don't know that it's back there, you're not allowed to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| And my concern is that having a beer license and running a gambling, you guys might want to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=745)|
| 0:12:37| I think the bottom line is Wolfie is asserting that there's a problem with some of these establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| for whom you've issued a beer permit operating illegal gambling machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| And it appears that the State Attorney General's Office won't actually prosecute these until they have multiple offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=766)|
| 0:12:53| His question to me was, what, if anything, can the commission do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| It's not crystal clear, but I think that since you issued this license or this permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| they're involved in illegal activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| At a minimum, you can bring them before this commission and make a determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| I'd rather litigate this in court than just allow illegal activity to occur in these establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=787)|
| 0:13:14| But I'll, of course, defer to the commission's wisdom on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=794)|
| 0:13:19| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| Lieutenant, could you come back up for a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| We talked briefly about this before, but what type of authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| or what type of proof do you need to open that locked door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| Is there something we need to do or can do that would give you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| We have the authority to go in any locked area that has a Knox County beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=823)|
| 0:13:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| Most of the time they open the doors and we go in and we get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| The problem is we're getting multiple times the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| We're on probably some of them the third time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| and at which time we are now citing them to court for illegal gambling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=845)|
| 0:14:11| Mr. Law Director, do we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| or can we pass a resolution that this be one of the penalties that could be added to a beer permit violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=855)|
| 0:14:26| that if there is illegal gambling in there, that this falls under the same category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| or similar category of selling to underage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| You'd actually have to amend your ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| But at this juncture, I think there's enough statutory case law to support you taking action now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| and then with the next commission meeting we can bring it back for first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| and actually have it as an enumerated offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| But in the interim, I believe that you're on decent ground to bring these people in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=887)|
| 0:14:53| if they're operating illegal activities on premises for which you've issued a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| Well, I would make a motion then that you draft such a change to have for us at the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| for a vote, first reading vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=904)|
| 0:15:10| Mr. Law Director, do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| Mr. Law Director, Lieutenant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=916)|
| 0:15:23| have you caught any of these people actually gambling in these places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=923)|
| 0:15:29| With the new state law, mere possession of them in Tennessee are illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=929)|
| 0:15:35| No, I mean, have you caught anybody actually using the machines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| Usually when we go in, someone is sitting on a bar stool playing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=938)|
| 0:15:44| Mr. Law Director, could we not put a $1,000 fine on our ordinance there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=944)|
| 0:15:52| that any establishment caught selling beer with an illegal gambling machine in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| in that establishment a $1,000 fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| Sir, I suspicion we can, but I would like to research it to see if we can, in fact, do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| I don't want to shoot from the hip on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| But I suspicion that you've got some fairly decent latitude,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| and I'll have that answer and the legislation drafted by the next board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| But if he's got that machine, I think suspicion should be over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| You know, it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| It must be a duck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| Very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| I would like to check that, Joe, see if we can find them up to $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| Wolfie, how many have you gotten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| You said 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| Is this in the past year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| In a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| We got three two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| We got three two weeks before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| Then these were multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| This is the second time on both of these places that we've gotten the machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| And they give us about 30, 40 days and put them back in and go again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| And we have to, you know, go hunt for them again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| Mr. Law Director, could we ask these six businesses to appear before us at our next month's beer board meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1024)|
| 0:17:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| I discussed that probability with Wolfie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| I think you can summon them before the commission and at least make inquiry at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| Again, I'd like to do some more research to see if you can actually retroactively take action against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1043)|
| 0:17:30| But at a minimum, I think you can, as the beer permit issuer, have them come and discuss it with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| Well, I would like to suggest that we have them appear before our next beer board meeting, whether we can take action or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| The mere fact that this is a public forum, it's televised, I think asking questions might make them a bit uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1060)|
| 0:17:48| And I'd like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| So if it would be appropriate, I'd like to have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| Do we need to issue subpoenas or how do we need to do that, Wolfie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| They may not want to come voluntarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| Do we need to issue some type of subpoena?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| I'd have to defer that to Joe up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| There actually was only two businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| Each one of them had three machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| Actually, one had four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| One had three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| So we're looking at two businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| Do we need to issue subpoenas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| We do have subpoena power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| That's certainly the cleanest methodology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| If we suspicion they won't come voluntarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| Well, would you recommend that we ask them voluntarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| or do you think we should go ahead and issue subpoenas requiring them to appear next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1104)|
| 0:18:29| Maybe a letter from the commission asking and then subpoena if that doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1109)|
| 0:18:39| I'll make a motion that we ask our law director to send a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| We already have one motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| Wolfie, Wolfie, did you say you'd go back in 40 to 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1127)|
| 0:18:52| if these people have these machines back in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| A lot of them do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| Well, we need to add to that $1,000 fine the second offense we pull their beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| If we can do that, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| I'll look at that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| Yes, I've got a question for the law director on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| Are we getting out here a little far in terms of due process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| And can we really do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| I mean, in the sense of these people have been accused of a crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| but they've not been convicted of a crime, even if you catch them red-handed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| I'm just talking about from the pure legality of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| Can we punish them for something they haven't been convicted of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| We have deferred even dealing with licenses in certain cases until a session court has ruled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1172)|
| 0:19:39| Where are we on this in terms of their rights to due process, rights of the accused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| before we start taking away property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| Well, in terms of what Wolfie is doing, he's empowered into state law to confiscate the machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| Apparently, again, the state attorney general has elected not to actually prosecute them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1192)|
| 0:19:58| until I believe there's a third offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| So it's almost like a three-strike rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| Is that correct, Mr. Wolfie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| So in terms of what you can do, as I prefaced my comments earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| I suspicion you can take action against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| And in the absence of any definitive law, I think it's something we should pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| Because, again, you issue this permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| Illegal activities are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| It would be no different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| Again, I think illegal gambling falls under the broad spectrum of moral turpitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| And moral turpitude is, of course, as you know, statutorily and within the body of your own writings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| one of the enumerated offenses for which they can be guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| It would be no difference if they were running prostitution, illegal drugs, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| So I wouldn't experiment with the condition of I suspicion you were not on good constitutional grounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1236)|
| 0:20:41| Again, sometimes it's not clear and concise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| But in terms of your overall broad police powers for health, welfare, and safety of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| I believe you can take enforcement action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| And I think the first step, as suggested by Commissioner Hammond and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| bring these people in, have them explain themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| And generally within this community, the word gets around quickly that it's not going to be tolerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| Lieutenant May, there are two businesses involved with multiple times where you've confiscated their property, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1274)|
| 0:21:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| Did you tell us who these businesses are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| Is that allowable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| What are these businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| Both of them are on Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| One is B&M Lounge on Asheville Highway at 4 Way Inn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1295)|
| 0:21:41| What district is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| Between seven and nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| That's why we were asking the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| The other one is the Oak Lounge, which is about halfway up from John Severe at 4 Way Inn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1310)|
| 0:21:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| If I could say one thing about the machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| When we confiscate them, we give the owners the right to come and claim them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1322)|
| 0:22:09| And if they claim them, then they are charged criminally with illegal gambling machines, promoting gambling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1329)|
| 0:22:17| So no one has ever come and claimed any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| So they didn't come back and claim the first confiscation, but you went back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| and there was another machine there and you grabbed it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| At both locations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Mr. Law Director, would it be permissible that we look at this list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| I'd be curious to know as to where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| Public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| So, Wolfie, can you provide that information to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| How many times have you gone in there to different places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| When you confiscate them and then what happens to them after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| Nobody wants to pick them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| Do you sell them to another state or something where it is legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| They're run over by a crusher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| We take them out to the dump and that big bulldozer runs over the top of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| The machines, most of them are valued at about $3,000 apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| Knox County can't sell it to another state or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| They're illegal to possess or have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| You can't even have parts in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| But, I mean, out in Las Vegas, are they legal out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| You know, if we can make some money out at another location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| I'd have to defer on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| I'm not sure how that would fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| Well, if it's legal in another state and we're crushing $3,000 machines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1423)|
| 0:23:49| and we can get $1,000 out of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| The state may be coming and talking to us on selling illegal machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| Never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| We have a motion on the floor to have our law director draft some resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1441)|
| 0:24:10| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| I think we're going to go back to number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| I think he's here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| Consideration of name change for the following establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| Fayazian Sons, 9233 Westland Drive, Fayazian Sons Incorporated, owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1464)|
| 0:24:30| Change name to Shell Food Mart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| I need to be sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| Please raise your right hand, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony you'll give here today will be the truth, the whole truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| and nothing but the truth, so help you God?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Please state your name for the record and your business address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| My name is Fayazian, 9233 Westland Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1486)|
| 0:24:53| And you're here today, sir, to ask for a name change of your business to Shell Food Mart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1493)|
| 0:24:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| Can you explain to the commission why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| It was by mistake when the application was filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| The corporation name is Fayazian Sons Inc., but Shell Food Mart was the name of the business before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1506)|
| 0:25:13| so everything was on this name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| Members of the commission, there is a valid beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| This seems to be ministerial in nature, but I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| Will we have to reissue a new license in this name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| The clerk will, yes, under the same name, but there should not be a transfer fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1536)|
| 0:25:42| Do you have something, Commissioner Gray?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| We have a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| The clerk will assist you in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| I'd like to go back and make a motion that we ask these two businesses to appear before the beer board next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1556)|
| 0:26:03| write a letter requesting that they come under threat of subpoena if they don't show up in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| I'd like to make that in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| Properly moved and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| Commissioner Armstrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| Yes, I had an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| We had the racetrack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| I can't remember exactly what the address was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| UK, what was the address of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| It's in the 9200 block of Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| They were supposed to send us a letter, which we haven't received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| and I wonder what kind of action we needed to take on that while we were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| Well, let's finish this one first, and then we'll come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| Are there any questions on Commissioner Hammond's motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| If not, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| Go ahead, Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| I just wanted to bring to your attention about the racetrack on, is it Oak Ridge Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| That they were supposed to submit a letter to this body, and we haven't received anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| I wonder what action we need to take on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| It wasn't on the agenda or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| I just want to bring it back to the attention of the Chairman and the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| Could we have the Law Director write a letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| The Law Director has wrote two letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| We've written letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| I suggest you bring them back before the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| and give good cause why they ignored a directive of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| Can we not suspend it until they get the letter in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| That goes back to the original issue with Commissioner Armstrong talking about due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| I think the safest bet is to have them come in and explain themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| We'll make a motion that we request them to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| Do you have something on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| UK, is this the racetrack that's near I-640?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| It's one close to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| It's all the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| Well, I don't know what the issue is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| Mr. Armstrong, could you explain the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| They were supposed to write a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| They came before this body with a violation, and we just, our only penalty, I think, in this particular case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| was that they just write us a letter how they were going to improve and, you know, so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| That's what we normally request, even with a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| I think in this case we didn't even require a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| This was an underage drinker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| What the point is, they haven't responded to us at all, and I just wondered, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| have them come in and show calls or give us another, as they say, bite at the apple?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1711)|
| 0:28:39| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| Motion on the floor is to give some in the establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| Yes, one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| Mr. Griffiths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| On the case of the owner up at the raceway on Asheville Highway, that did go to court this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1739)|
| 0:29:07| and he pled and got diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1747)|
| 0:29:18| I have one other thing that I want you to consider for our regular commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1758)|
| 0:29:25| for our December meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| It's been brought to my attention that the 21st is the week of December 25th, Christmas week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1767)|
| 0:29:34| A lot of people won't be around, so I'm going to put that on a discussion item in our regular commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1774)|
| 0:29:41| so you can be thinking about it, if it's a good time for you or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1781)|
| 0:29:47| We'd have to move up committees and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| Yeah, we'd have to move up the committees to the 7th and regular commission meeting on the 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1790)|
| 0:29:56| We don't have to, but it's up to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| But we'll discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| I'll make a motion to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| We'll do a commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| You have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| Yeah, I was wanting to ask this subpoena that we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| Now, is this setting up the procedure for the 202H subpoenas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| Well, how are we subpoenaing these people without a procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| Well, we have subpoena power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| They're just going to come before us and we're going to ask them questions about these gambling machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| This is not a formal 202H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| Well, I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| I thought the commission had subpoena powers too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| Seeing none, nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| This meeting is adjourned until 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=1835)|

| 0:37:34| It's kind of good to see a childhood hero come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| and make a valuable contribution not only to the university, but also to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| It looks like this energy savings program, which I encourage us to do more of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=2265)|
| 0:37:51| both in our schools and other county facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=2271)|

| 0:37:59| So I'd just like to acknowledge Bernard King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=2279)|

| 0:38:53| Could you just kind of give us a brief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=2333)|

| 0:48:24| I was at your meeting here a while back, and they appointed a mediator to work with me and my children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=2904)|
| 0:48:33| They took my house and cars away from me and everything and won't give them back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=2913)|
| 0:48:40| And they had my driver's license void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| They turned in and had Alzheimer's, which I don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| My wife died in 2003, and I've lived by myself ever since and have my checking account and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=2925)|
| 0:48:53| And I'm having to bum rides and hire cabs, and my wife's people take me to church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=2933)|
| 0:49:02| And I need to get my car back in my house, and I'd given my son-in-law power of attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| and he used it illegally, transferred my house to his brother-in-law and his wife and transferred my car to his wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=2947)|
| 0:49:18| And I had five cars, and my wife died, and I gave three of them to my grandkids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| and wanted a man to paint my house, kept one with 10,000 miles on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| They called the law and had me come out to their house January 31st of 08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=2967)|
| 0:49:34| It was 7 o'clock one night, and they wanted me to surrender my car to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| And it just had 12,000 miles on it, and my wife died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| And I said, well, I'm not. I paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| I've got good insurance and a good record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| And they talked to a doctor saying I had Alzheimer's, and he didn't examine me or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=2987)|
| 0:49:54| So I've been to every senior citizen program in town, and none of them have been able to help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=2994)|
| 0:50:02| But me and you all got this mediator to have a meeting with me and my son and daughter, I guess it was last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3002)|
| 0:50:15| And they didn't arrive at any conclusions, couldn't get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| They just kept lying about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| So they gave up on the meeting, and I just wondered if there was any other thing I could do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3020)|
| 0:50:31| anything you all could do to help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| I didn't think anybody would be able to take your house and car away from you in the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3033)|
| 0:50:39| and lie and say you had Alzheimer's and get your driver's license revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| And I got a letter from an insurance company since that time saying that I was such a good driver,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3044)|
| 0:50:49| they lowered my insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| And the psychiatrist, they called the law and told them I was threatening to kill myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3051)|
| 0:50:57| and I don't even have a gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| They took me over to UT and run up a $7,000 bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| And the psychiatrist there told them I had an MRI in my brain and it was working perfect on both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| and couldn't find nothing wrong with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| He gave me all kinds of tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| And he told my daughter, he said, I don't see how I can help you and your brother| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| or what you're trying to do to your dad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| I can't find anything wrong with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| And they weren't satisfied with that, and they took me over to the GAP program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| I was over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| They told me I could come home in nine days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3087)|
| 0:51:30| Somebody would come and get me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| And I called my daughter to come and get me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| And she said that she couldn't come right then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| It would be later on in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| She was keeping the grandkids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| Well, she didn't come and get me that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| And I called her that night and she said, well, your son told me not to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| and he'd pick you up tomorrow night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| And they took $2,000 more on the bill by keeping me two extra days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3111)|
| 0:51:56| And I got hired an attorney and told them I was going to report them to Medicare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| and make them pay that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| Now I'm paying out $10,000 at Baptist and $7,000 at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3122)|
| 0:52:10| And if they didn't give it back to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| and my son had come to my attorney and said he'd give it back to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| but they won't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| And it'll soon be two years since all this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| And I'm having a terrible time getting around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| And I can't cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| And I was going out to eat at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| And, of course, they took my car and I was eating every meal out at a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| So I'm just eating sandwiches and things and trying to get along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3152)|
| 0:52:38| But I think it's a terrible state of affairs when you can't get any help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| in the town you was raised in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| Somebody's done you a bad turn that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| I just wanted to present it to Henry if he had any suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3168)|
| 0:52:53| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3175)|
| 0:52:56| Law Director, is there anything we can do for this gentleman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| I mean, I want to recommend that he gets himself an attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| and take some legal action against these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| But is there anything that we can do, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| is there anything within our power to do that could help this man?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| Commissioner Lambert, members of the Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| as you recall when this arose the last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| we referred this gentleman to Jackie Cutterill with Community Mediation Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3198)|
| 0:53:23| which he's alluded to, and they tried to work that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| We likewise asked him whether or not he contacted the Knoxville Bar for a pro bono| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3205)|
| 0:53:31| or a low-cost attorney, and I believe he's tried that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| Because this is a conflict between he and his family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| the only thing I can suggest is if it rises to the level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| and I don't know enough facts that it's consistent with elder abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| he can contact Tennessee Adult Protective Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| There's a local agency here, funded by the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| that is designed to preclude fraud, waste, and abuse of elderly people, senior citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| and there's a local number for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| Beyond that, because you're dealing with a gentleman who's in conflict with his family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| and apparently there's already legal counsel involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| legally there's nothing you can do to assist him, sadly and unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3246)|
| 0:54:12| So my suggestion would be that he approach Tennessee Adult Protective Services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| and they would investigate the case, see if there's an elder abuse situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| and if so, they will appoint him counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| Sir, I wish there was something we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| and one thing I do want to say to anyone listening is when you sign a power of attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3269)|
| 0:54:35| you're signing your identity over to folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| And, you know, I mean, I understand Alzheimer's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| I've had family members with Alzheimer's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| but I'll tell you this, any of the family members that my family had that had Alzheimer's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3285)|
| 0:54:52| they were not as sharp, sir, as you are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| I'm not a medical expert, but you don't seem to me like you've got Alzheimer's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| though I'm not qualified to make that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| But I'll also say this, the family members that we had that had Alzheimer's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| we had family members looking after them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| We had family members driving them where they needed to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| And, sir, I think due to the fact, in fact, I would imagine, and I don't know the law on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3313)|
| 0:55:20| but I would imagine just due to the fact that you're up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| if you had Alzheimer's, that would be some sort of neglect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| And like I said, it just looks to me like they've taken advantage of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| and all I can say is what I said last time, I hope you'll get the legal help you need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| and I'm really sorry that you're going through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| and I just wish that we had the power to fix this for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| but unfortunately in our system, you know, we just don't have that kind of power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3346)|
| 0:55:52| We're commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| We're not kings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| You know, we have very limited of what we can do, but I do feel for your situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| and I think that just the fact that you're up here by yourself speaks volumes as to your family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3360)|
| 0:56:07| and I think that anyone watching this today can see that you've been taken advantage of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3367)|
| 0:56:15| and if that gives you some satisfaction, I hope that it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| Sir, I hired an attorney, Joe Levin, and he canceled the power of attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3379)|
| 0:56:27| and my son-in-law had put my daughter and son on the bottom of it too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3387)|
| 0:56:33| and he canceled that with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| He told them they'd be in court if they didn't give everything back to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| and my son came to the attorney and said they didn't want to go to court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| and they signed it back over to me, but it's been almost two years and they won't do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| and they won't even talk to me now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| Is your lawyer working in any way on this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| Well, he's had open heart surgery since then here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3412)|
| 0:56:57| and he had some apartments out at Clinton or Oak Ridge that they wanted him to retire down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| and he's involved in a lawsuit with them, so he's got more than he can say gracefully for himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3422)|
| 0:57:07| That's Joe, and I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| Joe is a very fine attorney, but he tends to specialize in free speech issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3429)|
| 0:57:16| He's represented a lot of adult businesses in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| I'm not sure if he's a specialist in elder abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| and I think that the advice our law director gave you may steer you toward somebody who may specialize in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3442)|
| 0:57:30| Well, they all tell me that I got one lady,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| and she said we'd sue them for damages and sue that doctor for making a false report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3454)|
| 0:57:42| and she'd take it on commission, and then she sent me papers to fill out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| and she wanted a $5,000 retainer fee and $200 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| So that's the kind of stuff I run into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| I know, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3475)|
| 0:57:56| We have the best system in the world, if you can afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3480)|
| 0:58:01| Commissioner Carrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| Yes, I just wanted to know if there are any family members in the audience that would like to speak on their behalf with this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3483)|
| 0:58:12| I have a friend here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| Because we got some e-mails from the last time from some of the friends of the family or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3494)|
| 0:58:22| I do have a big, big concern with having family in the medical field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3502)|
| 0:58:27| You're telling us that you were not examined by a doctor that declared that you had Alzheimer's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3507)|
| 0:58:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3513)|
| 0:58:34| Well, that should be the proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| So, again, I'm very sorry, and I can't imagine a physician signing without seeing you as a patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3517)|
| 0:58:49| So hopefully there will be someone out there listening to this, an attorney or whatever, that can help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3529)|
| 0:58:55| And now you're telling us that you actually do have your power of attorney back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| And I also have a paper from a doctor saying there's nothing wrong with my brain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| Both sides are working equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| I went to Peninsula Hospital and took a sanity test, and I made 100 percent on the score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3546)|
| 0:59:15| I hope someone is listening in the audience or at home that might could step up in the legal realm and help this gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3555)|
| 0:59:25| Jill from my office does have the number for Adult Protective Services, and she'll give that to him when he's finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3565)|
| 0:59:34| Well, I'm going to sue them for money, too, because they've got money and they didn't need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3574)|
| 0:59:40| Sir, are you willing to give out your phone number anyway, if anybody is listening, that they can contact you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3580)|
| 0:59:47| Give my number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| Well, just if you're comfortable with it, sir, if you want to give your name and address so that maybe someone watching this show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3589)|
| 0:59:57| a lot of attorneys watch county government, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| I need a good trial attorney is what I need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| Well, he had to give his name and address for the record, so if there's an attorney watching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3603)|
| 1:00:09| then they can contact the clerk's office, the commission library, and get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3609)|
| 1:00:16| Sir, if Jill will stand up, she'll give you the number of the protective services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3616)|
| 1:00:25| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| Mr. George Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| Will you give me your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| We already have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| Here she comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| She's coming around to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3639)|
| 1:00:45| She's going to beat the same horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| I'm George Hamilton, and I've got something that makes me talk funny this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3648)|
| 1:00:54| But I live at 2812 Greenway Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3654)|
| 1:01:03| And you don't have to be a member of the county commission to help another human being that's in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3663)|
| 1:01:11| So you people that are sitting around the room here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| shuck off that county commissioner thing and look at him as a person that's begging you all for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3674)|
| 1:01:22| You all understand that kind of talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| Okay, that's what I want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| Okay, I'm not going to talk about Roy Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3687)|
| 1:01:31| Roy Duncan has gone through every hoop in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3691)|
| 1:01:36| When we went to the police department to accuse his family of kidnapping, abduction, and all these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3696)|
| 1:01:44| they didn't ask us to go somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| They demanded that we go to the other services where Roy was kidnapped and abducted against his will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3706)|
| 1:01:54| And they just said, you have to go somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3714)|
| 1:01:58| I've got a list at home that I've got started of 20 places that we've been, 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3718)|
| 1:02:04| You know why we're up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| It's because we've run out of options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| And I'm up here to talk to you about Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| Knox County's got more problems than Carter's got liver pills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3733)|
| 1:02:19| And I don't see anybody that's trying to really solve any of the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3739)|
| 1:02:24| Oh, you're worried about setbacks and two-foot easements and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| But anyway, I don't know if we'll just keep coming back until he wears you out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| and you do decide one of you to step forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| And there's plenty of men on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| And there's a couple or three ladies on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3762)|
| 1:02:46| And I would say literally in the times that we're in right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| and I'm not going to lay it on you too hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| but I'd say in today's time you'd be more likely for a woman to step forward and help you than you would a man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3773)|
| 1:03:00| And Roy needs some help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| Roy does not have Alzheimer's disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| He does not have anything wrong with his mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| And he needs the help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| If you can't do it as a commissioner, go to your preacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3791)|
| 1:03:15| But don't ask him to pray because Roy's already prayed about it for 18 or 20 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3795)|
| 1:03:22| And it ain't doing the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| But anyway, I'll be back in this straight Knox County out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| It's got plenty of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| And you've got a couple of people here that's keenly interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| And I don't see anybody asleep, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3813)|
| 1:03:41| Brad, you're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3821)|
| 1:03:47| Thank you, Tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| Well, Jolie, if you could tie me into the big screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| I usually come here and speak about engineering and public works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| but I've decided to speak about something different today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| I've decided to speak about this homeless shelter that we're talking about building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3842)|
| 1:04:08| Brad, do you want to wait until that comes up at 5.01?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3848)|
| 1:04:13| Well, I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| I was just going to use my five minutes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| Well, you'll still get five minutes, but it's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3859)|
| 1:04:20| Well, I'll go ahead and use it on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3860)|
| 1:04:21| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| I don't think that Mr. Weitrick or Mr. Salter showed up for how many months in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3862)|
| 1:04:28| I have been looking for a piece of property that is sold for $250,000 an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3868)|
| 1:04:36| Now, I don't want you all to get me wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| I'm not against helping the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| I'm very much in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| The problem is I can't justify the price we're paying for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3884)|
| 1:04:49| Now, I dabble in real estate a bit, and I have looked thoroughly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3889)|
| 1:04:54| and I could not find a piece of apartment property in the history of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3894)|
| 1:04:59| that has ever sold for $250,000 an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| The best I've been able to find was half that amount, 120,000 an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| over off around Walker Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| But I can't find anything that's ever sold that high for apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| So I got to looking, what kind of property do you usually buy for $250,000 an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3914)|
| 1:05:20| The first one I found, back before the real estate market crashed in 2003| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3920)|
| 1:05:27| when we were going great guns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| 5.19 acres sold right in the heart of Turkey Creek Shopping Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3929)|
| 1:05:34| that fronts Parkside Drive right next door to Pinnacle Movie Theaters for 294,000 an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3934)|
| 1:05:44| That was before the real estate crash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| I found another one next door to that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| It sold for $275,000 an acre for 6.92 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3950)|
| 1:05:55| That was in 2005 when Knox County was at its absolute peak in the real estate market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3955)|
| 1:06:03| So I'm trying to find anything that has sold for around $250,000 an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| after the real estate market crashed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| I did find this piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| And this is basically, the state's been planning a new interstate exit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| for the Turkey Creek Shopping Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| And you can see where they're going to realign Campbell Station Road over here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3982)|
| 1:06:29| and they're moving Snyder Road and it's going to be the red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3989)|
| 1:06:32| This lot is going to be the key corner on the new Turkey Creek Shopping Center interstate exit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3992)|
| 1:06:38| that the state's planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| That lot sold for $257,000 an acre last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4000)|
| 1:06:45| Now, in my mind, and it's not about whether or not to help the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| I don't want anybody to construe this wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| But in my mind, I cannot see in a million years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| for the second from the last lot on a dead-end street in a residential area across from a daycare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4017)|
| 1:07:04| paying as much property as you could buy the key corner at the Turkey Creek Shopping Center for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4024)|
| 1:07:10| That is absolutely no justification for that price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| And I just wanted to show up and take a few minutes and just tell you how strongly I feel that we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4035)|
| 1:07:22| It's not against buying this piece of property, but we need to let them do this appraisal first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| We need to find out exactly what it's costing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| and we don't need to leave any kind of a pass anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| and not even know what an appraisal is going to come at or what the final price is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4054)|
| 1:07:38| and have the taxpayers take a screw job on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| I can buy the corner lot at the interstate exit for Turkey Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4062)|
| 1:07:47| for the exact, almost exact same price per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| as you're looking at paying for the last lot on a dead-end street that's zoned for apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4070)|
| 1:07:57| There's never been apartment property bring this much in the history of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4077)|
| 1:08:02| So I think, you know, I try and speak from the cuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| and I really take a great interest in our public monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| This ain't about the location to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| It's strictly about money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| And I just have a hard time buying this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4094)|
| 1:08:19| I'm not against the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| I'm not against what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| I'm against that kind of money for that kind of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| And I guess I still don't see Mr. Salter or Mr. Weitrick here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4106)|
| 1:08:31| so I'll just save the comments and where I've caught them red-handed in some stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| until they bother showing up at a commission meeting while I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| But thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| Thank you, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4121)|
| 1:08:50| I'm going to recognize Mr. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4130)|
| 1:08:57| Thank you, Commissioner and Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| What I'd like to do is just give you a brief update on the flu vaccine season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| where we are and kind of what we're doing at the Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4145)|
| 1:09:09| and maybe some information about across the state on vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4149)|
| 1:09:14| All the flu virus that's circulating in Knox County right now is the H1N1 virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4154)|
| 1:09:22| So, as you know, it's a serious illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| In Tennessee, as far as the percentage of patients that have been admitted to the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4165)|
| 1:09:31| with flu-like illnesses, we have seen an increase in the last few weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4171)|
| 1:09:36| and it's now about 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| So, again, as I said, it's a very serious illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4179)|
| 1:09:43| We've had about 45 confirmed deaths in Tennessee, 34 adults and 11 children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4183)|
| 1:09:50| As far as the virus and the vaccine, the virus has remained stable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4190)|
| 1:09:56| meaning it's the same as the virus that was first identified back in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4196)|
| 1:10:01| It's not mutated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| What that really means for us is that the vaccine matches the virus strain very closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4203)|
| 1:10:10| As far as the distribution for the vaccine, first seasonal vaccine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4210)|
| 1:10:16| a lot of private providers in Knox County is running out of the seasonal vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4216)|
| 1:10:22| We have some at the Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| We just got some in, so we will be making that available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| It is available now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| As far as the H1N1 vaccine and the distribution by the federal government to the states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4230)|
| 1:10:36| it's been done by population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| Tennessee, I think we're very fortunate in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| We have a very capable staff in Nashville with the Department of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4243)|
| 1:10:47| We have about 2 percent of the population in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| and we've administered about 4 percent or greater than 4 percent of the vaccine available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4251)|
| 1:10:58| In Knox County, we certainly have gotten our share of the vaccine here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4258)|
| 1:11:03| and it's been available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| Across what we've done, the vaccine's been available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| Many private providers have had the vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4269)|
| 1:11:12| They have it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| The Health Department has received about half of the local supply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| and we have shared a lot of that vaccine with private providers who were not on the list to receive it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4279)|
| 1:11:27| We have, the first couple weeks, most of the vaccine was targeted towards pediatric patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4287)|
| 1:11:35| so we made sure that the pediatricians in the community had the vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| We currently, as of 12 o'clock today, we have small amounts of the injectable vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4300)|
| 1:11:46| We have a larger amount of the nasal mist available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4306)|
| 1:11:51| We started offering the vaccine in the schools about two weeks ago, and we've done five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4311)|
| 1:11:56| We do it by the numbers of vaccine we have available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| I don't really have a projection on when or if we will, how many doses we'll be receiving in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4321)|
| 1:12:09| It seems to be a week-by-week scenario on the vaccine distribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4329)|
| 1:12:15| So that's just a little update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| Yes, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4343)|
| 1:12:24| You gave us statistics for the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| What about Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| How many approximate cases have we had reported in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| I know we've had, unfortunately, some deaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| We've had, you know, I don't have an accurate count on the number of cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4354)|
| 1:12:41| I do know about the deaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4361)|
| 1:12:42| We've had three deaths in Knox County, and they've been in the adult population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4362)|
| 1:12:46| I don't have an accurate count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| How many doses have we gotten in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| I know you probably don't know how many people have been vaccinated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| but do you know the number of doses that we've received?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| I know about the total number of doses have been about 50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4375)|
| 1:13:01| Have there been any issues with the vaccine, people who have had the vaccine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4381)|
| 1:13:04| reactions to them that you've heard about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| In Tennessee, there's been a couple cases, a couple adverse reactions that's been investigated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4388)|
| 1:13:14| and I think everything has been, those cases have been identified as minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4394)|
| 1:13:20| The soreness on the arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| But basically, this vaccine, the H1N1 vaccine, has had milder reactions than even the seasonal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4404)|
| 1:13:34| It's been a very mild type of vaccine for reactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4414)|
| 1:13:40| Dr. Briggs, maybe want to help me out here any time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| The shot didn't hurt at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| I've had both this year, and I would encourage everyone else to get it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| I've had both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| Mr. Jones, I have a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| Commissioner Hammond hit one that I hadn't written down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| Why are some people saying that this vaccine is not safe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4445)|
| 1:14:11| You know, Commissioner, there are some people who think all vaccines have issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4451)|
| 1:14:18| The H1N1 vaccine is as safe as any vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| It's produced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4463)|
| 1:14:24| It's made the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| My belief is that we live in an age of misinformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| False rumors get started, and it's, you know, I don't know the real answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4471)|
| 1:14:37| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| I believe it's safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| It's safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4480)|
| 1:14:41| I certainly would encourage everyone to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| I happen to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| I'm a little bit older than you, and I remember the last swine flu vaccine that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| because I was in the medical field in 1976.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| It comes from the rumors that go around come from two sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4493)|
| 1:14:58| One, when we had the swine flu epidemic in 1976, if you recall, it was very similar to this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4498)|
| 1:15:05| It turned out not to be as deadly as the H1N1 has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| but just like President Obama declared a national emergency several weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| President Ford, Gerald Ford, who was the president then, declared a national emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| and they started manufacturing the vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4517)|
| 1:15:20| The process for the vaccine was very different then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| The flu mist is an attenuated vaccine, and then the shot is a kill vaccine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| but we had all attenuated vaccines back then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| and the process that they used to grow the swine vaccine in 1976 was very different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4531)|
| 1:15:36| than what they used for the ordinary flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| And what happened, we had several cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| which was a type of paralysis that developed in people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4542)|
| 1:15:46| It never was directly related to the vaccine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| but there was enough evidence that people were very suspicious of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| So I think that's one place where it came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| The other came is that a few years ago there were rumors that the mercury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4556)|
| 1:16:01| that's in the manufacturing of vaccines caused autism in children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4561)|
| 1:16:07| and I think that's been completely disproven now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| There's about the same amount of mercury in the vaccine shot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| and it's only in the multiviral shots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| If they have the individual syringes, there's no mercury in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| about the same as you'd get from eating a tuna fish sandwich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| And first of all, that's been disproven about the autism problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| and secondly, the amount of mercury in the larger multidose vials is just miniscule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4585)|
| 1:16:32| Like I said, it's about equal to what you get in a tuna fish sandwich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| If you use the flu mist, which is the nasal injection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| or the individually manufactured syringes, they have no mercury in that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4598)|
| 1:16:46| Okay, I've got a couple more and then I'll be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4606)|
| 1:16:50| You know, when we talk about having 45 deaths in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| that's a lot of people for one illness like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4613)|
| 1:16:59| You know, I would agree with what Commissioner Briggs has said about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4619)|
| 1:17:04| some of the stories that get started and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4624)|
| 1:17:08| I'm old enough to remember back when the polio vaccine came out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4628)|
| 1:17:12| the same thing happens at that particular point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| Has there been any discussion in Tennessee about taking this vaccine mandatory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4636)|
| 1:17:24| No, there's never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| To my knowledge, in Tennessee, it's certainly not ever been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4646)|
| 1:17:31| And I think when Congress passed the authorization to buy the vaccine from the pharmaceutical companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4651)|
| 1:17:40| it was called the National Voluntary Vaccine Program, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4660)|
| 1:17:45| Voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4665)|
| 1:17:46| So I don't even think there's been any discussion on a national level of any substance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| Maybe, again, false rumors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4671)|
| 1:17:55| I think everybody, I certainly would be against that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4675)|
| 1:17:59| and I think everybody in Knox County would be against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| Well, I would, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| But the same token, there are some vaccines that are mandatory from birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4684)|
| 1:18:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| For children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| One last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4691)|
| 1:18:14| Would you give this vaccine to your child?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| Not only would I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| My son is a freshman or he's a sophomore at UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| and I actually insisted on him coming over and getting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4704)|
| 1:18:28| My wife probably gave him his shot, so I'm okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| I just wanted to chime in that my family has all been vaccinated against the seasonal flu,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| and we actually went to the health department, to their clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| and got our flu mask for the H1N1, and it was a very pleasant experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4723)|
| 1:18:49| and they got us in and out really quick, and thank you for providing that service for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4729)|
| 1:18:54| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| Mark, I think where this scare came in, first of all, I'm not for or against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4736)|
| 1:19:02| I think that should be left up to the individual that wants to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| But our own government said that this vaccine had not been properly tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4745)|
| 1:19:11| We have two state senators here that are against it and not going to take it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| and we have several congressmen that said they're not going to take it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| and I'm sure that they probably know more about it than I do, which I know absolutely nothing about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4758)|
| 1:19:24| but I think that's where the scare has come from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| is the government saying that it has not been properly tested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4767)|
| 1:19:31| and the way our representatives in the state of Tennessee have spoken out against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| So I can understand people having fear, but you want to know where this rumor started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4775)|
| 1:19:40| Apparently it started with our government and our representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4780)|
| 1:19:45| Commissioner, you know, I'm not going to disagree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| Maybe you'd disagree with me a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| I don't know of any government agency that said that this vaccine is not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4791)|
| 1:19:58| I'm aware that some of our congressional representatives have, I'm not sure they refuse to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4798)|
| 1:20:06| I believe that they have looked at the priority groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4806)|
| 1:20:10| and some of them are not in the priority groups and may be waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| I'm not sure that everything that was reported about that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4813)|
| 1:20:17| But I'm not aware of any government agency saying that this vaccine is not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4817)|
| 1:20:24| And I believe it's safe, and I believe it's made just like the vaccine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4824)|
| 1:20:29| that we've been given in this country for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| It's made and produced the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| So it's as safe as any vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| I'm not saying any government agency said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| but one of the representatives in the state of Tennessee said he was going to take the shot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| said that it had not been properly tested, and they didn't know anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| What I'm saying is Mr. Brown asked the question about why this rumor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| or someone did get started, and it originated from our government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| with people like our representatives saying that they weren't going to take it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| and other ones saying that it had not been properly tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4864)|

| 1:21:40| Read it into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| Whereas Loyal Griffin's faithful served the citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| by devoting his life to working tirelessly to fight racism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| and improve public education in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| And whereas Loyal Griffin's service to mankind is reflected in his honorable service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4912)|
| 1:21:57| in the U.S. Navy in the Pacific, South Pacific, during World War II,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4917)|

| 1:22:09| in the Pacific and continued his service in the Navy Reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| Retiring after 20 years of honorable service as a lieutenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4933)|
| 1:22:19| And whereas Loyal Griffin, throughout a life of service in various civic organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| was a University of Tennessee graduate and torchbearer member of the Scarabinian Senior Society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4944)|

| 1:22:49| And whereas Loyal Griffin, as a member of the Second Presbyterian Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| taught Sunday school for 40 years and served as an elder, a deacon, and a member of the church choir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4973)|

| 1:23:14| as a public servant and a friend of the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=4994)|

| 1:23:23| and in so doing express our sincere condolences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5003)|
| 1:23:26| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5006)|
| 1:23:31| as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5011)|
| 1:23:38| Thank you, Commission, for voting for this unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5018)|
| 1:23:42| Commissioner Saunders for co-sponsoring it with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| Loyal was a dear friend of mine. I felt like I knew him all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| I actually knew him for the last 26 years. That's all my political life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5028)|
| 1:23:52| In fact, he was there whenever I needed him for advice and support and encouragement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5032)|
| 1:23:58| And oftentimes I needed a letter to the editor to get my point of view across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| and he always was good for that and the Sentinel would always print it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5043)|
| 1:24:07| because a man of his stature, they always printed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| As was mentioned, he was a pioneer in the civil rights field before it was involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| before it was the cool thing to do, and he was just a pillar of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| And I'm honored to have, again, known him for the last 26 years of his 95 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5057)|
| 1:24:28| I am Jim Giffen. I am Loyal Giffen's son. I want to say thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5068)|
| 1:24:33| I've known for a long, long time that I pick my parents really, really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5073)|
| 1:24:40| And it's always nice when other people recognize that, too. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5080)|
| 1:24:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5085)|
| 1:25:01| We're going to 501 on page 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| approving an agreement with the Southeastern Housing Foundation, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| to provide $443,200 in the Community Development Block Grant Program funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5111)|
| 1:25:17| and $56,800 in the Tennessee Housing Development Agency Program income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5117)|
| 1:25:22| for the acquisition of property located at 125 DuBose Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5122)|
| 1:25:26| for the development of permanent supportive housing for chronologically homeless individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5126)|

| 1:25:36| Eight oh, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5136)|
| 1:25:38| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5138)|
| 1:25:39| Nine oh, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5139)|
| 1:25:40| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5140)|
| 1:25:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| There's a motion to approve and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| Do we have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5150)|
| 1:25:55| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| Yes, I'm going to make a few comments on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5157)|
| 1:26:04| This is really a very difficult thing to speak about because there's many of us, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5164)|
| 1:26:09| who really believe in the 10-year program to end chronic homelessness because it is a good program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5169)|
| 1:26:16| It's a compassionate program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| It's a program that's good for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5178)|
| 1:26:21| not only because we're taking unfortunate individuals off of the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5181)|
| 1:26:25| and putting them in an environment where they can succeed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| but some of these individuals, because of either their mental illness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5189)|
| 1:26:34| or some of their dependency problems, are right now, as far as even the population is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5194)|
| 1:26:40| are wandering around without any help and no supervision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5200)|
| 1:26:45| And what the permanent supportive housing provides is the ability to someone to help them take their medicines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5205)|
| 1:26:52| It allows them to receive the social services that many of them require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5212)|
| 1:26:58| and gets them out from under the bridges and out in the woods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| where really no human being should have to live when they're not making that choice really and truly of their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5221)|
| 1:27:09| Nevertheless, when we look at this particular project, there are some problems with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5229)|
| 1:27:15| First of all, we obviously have limited resources to take care of the homeless people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5235)|
| 1:27:22| And when we look to spend these resources, it has to be in a way that we can help the most people the best way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5242)|
| 1:27:31| Part of the problem with this particular project, I think Brad Mays, who spoke earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5251)|
| 1:27:36| he was the gentleman, for those of you who don't know, who had the little slide show about the cost of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5256)|
| 1:27:41| And as you can see, this property is very expensive, even for West Knox County property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5261)|
| 1:27:48| The project calls for 23 units to house 23 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5268)|
| 1:27:54| And if we start looking at the cost per unit when we're buying raw land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5274)|
| 1:27:59| and then building something on it, that gets to be very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5279)|
| 1:28:05| Secondly, this is not a shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| It's not a place where someone else provides them with food and clothing and medications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5288)|
| 1:28:14| This is a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5294)|
| 1:28:15| It's an apartment building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5295)|
| 1:28:16| These people literally have to fend for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| There are case workers that will be on site who will be able to help them with some of their social needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5299)|
| 1:28:25| In other words, getting some of the benefits that they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5305)|
| 1:28:29| But they will have to shop on their own, go to the grocery store, go to the drugstore and buy their medicine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| shop for their clothes, and be able to get back and forth to accomplish these tasks that are required for daily living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5314)|
| 1:28:45| There's no bus line out there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5325)|
| 1:28:46| Yes, it can be extended, but again, that's an additional cost in an environment where we have limited resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5326)|
| 1:28:55| And I think as we look at this is that this is not the right place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5335)|
| 1:29:01| and it's not the right price for this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5341)|
| 1:29:05| Again, I want to remind everyone that these people, and there's probably anyone here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5345)|
| 1:29:13| if you really look in your own families, in your own background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| that hasn't had a problem with alcohol or drugs or mental illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| a lot of these people are veterans that have served defending the freedoms that we enjoy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5360)|
| 1:29:26| including the right for us to assemble here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5366)|
| 1:29:30| And I think we owe it to those people to find them the right environment for them to be able to thrive in our society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5370)|
| 1:29:37| because of misfortune, much of it to no fault of their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5377)|
| 1:29:43| I know there's been concerns expressed about how these people, and they refer to those as these people, are dangerous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5383)|
| 1:29:52| but I'd like to remind everyone that even nationally we see on television where there's been problem in churches with pedophilia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5392)|
| 1:30:04| There's been problems with ministers right here in this town absconding with church resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5404)|
| 1:30:11| And just to look at myself and say that I'm not immune to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| we recently had a physician who not only was a physician and a military officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5415)|
| 1:30:21| who killed 13 people and wounded another 31 or 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5421)|
| 1:30:29| So I don't think that you can say that one group of people are good people and one group of people are bad people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5429)|
| 1:30:35| But if you look at this entire project, it costs too much, it's in the wrong spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| and it's not a place where I think the people who would be placed there would be able to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5440)|
| 1:30:49| I think we need to find a place where we can help more people with the amount of money we spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| and then put them in an environment where they do have an opportunity to succeed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5453)|
| 1:30:57| and not in an environment where it would be difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5457)|
| 1:31:01| And I think as my fellow commissioners look at this, I would encourage you to consider that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5461)|
| 1:31:07| and vote no on this particular project and see if we can find a better location for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5467)|
| 1:31:14| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5474)|
| 1:31:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| I think Mr. Briggs stated it very well, my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5478)|
| 1:31:23| I agree with him 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5483)|
| 1:31:26| I believe that at this particular site, at this particular price, is this too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5486)|
| 1:31:33| I believe that we can help instead of 23 of these individuals that need the help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5493)|
| 1:31:39| I believe we need to try to help 50, 60, 70 people instead for the same amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5499)|
| 1:31:48| Then you take a look at the site itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| There is no public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| There's no sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5513)|
| 1:31:56| So if they were trying to access any of the businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5516)|
| 1:32:00| or even the help that's out in that area, it would be dangerous for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5520)|
| 1:32:05| It would be dangerous for anybody to walk along Kingston Pike at that particular block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5525)|
| 1:32:10| And I'm going to ask my fellow commissioners to vote no because of the price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5530)|
| 1:32:16| and because the services are just not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5536)|
| 1:32:21| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| Unfortunately, when you read in the media and you talk with people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5545)|
| 1:32:29| a lot of folks are trying to make this as a north, south, and east versus the west issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5549)|
| 1:32:35| and that is not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| The fact that the notion is that the folks in West Knoxville don't want any of this housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5557)|
| 1:32:43| I think is a misnomer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| I do not believe that to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| I think that rather they're looking at it in terms of is this the appropriate location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5567)|
| 1:32:52| and is this a good deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| And so the whole notion that somehow the folks in West Knoxville do not want to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5576)|
| 1:33:01| those who are less fortunate, a lot of homeless people are already in West Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5581)|
| 1:33:07| I live near the corner of Fox, Lonus, and Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| I can tell you that there are people living in tents in a wooded area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| about a block from where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5593)|
| 1:33:15| I see them. I know that they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| There are folks down in Campbell Station Road area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| You see them at Lovell Road, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| I personally have worked with Knox Area Rescue Ministries on their board for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5602)|
| 1:33:26| have been involved in their Coach for the Coal campaign for over 27 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5606)|
| 1:33:29| and I can go on with volunteer ministry and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| My daughter worked at Serenity Shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| I understand the importance of an address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| If you are homeless, one thing you want is an address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5617)|
| 1:33:41| We ask people who come to this podium, what's your address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5621)|
| 1:33:45| Imagine if you're going to a prospective employer and they ask you your address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5625)|
| 1:33:49| and you say, well, my address is in a tent at the corner of Fox, Lonus, and Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| You're not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| Or imagine if you say that your address is at one of the shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5634)|
| 1:33:59| The people that we're talking about here are folks who have made a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| that they want to change their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| They are not people that are out on the street with the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5644)|
| 1:34:08| That's usually the face of homeless in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| But there are other people who have said, I don't want to live like this anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| I want an address. I want a house. I want a roof over my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| I want to provide for my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| I understand that, and I think that the majority of people in our community do understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| So in looking at is this the right location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| I would remind my fellow commissioners that over 200 people showed up at a public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| just three nights ago or four nights ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| and I dare say 190 of those were against this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5673)|
| 1:34:37| It's been well publicized the reasons why that they are against this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5677)|
| 1:34:43| So then the other thing that we look at is we look at the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| I asked the property assessor to pull the numbers for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5686)|
| 1:34:50| and I'm sure some of you have seen this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| but there's a building value of $50,000, a land value of $80,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5692)|
| 1:34:57| We're looking at $130,000, that is dollars that are appraised value for 125 Dubusque Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5697)|
| 1:35:05| We're being asked to approve a resolution for $500,000 to purchase this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5705)|
| 1:35:16| That is in excess of the appraised value that we have from the assessor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5716)|
| 1:35:21| and I realize that you can go out and get other people to do appraisals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| and it might be more or it might be less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| That's a $370,000 difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5727)|
| 1:35:33| I have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| Just because we have monies available from the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5735)|
| 1:35:40| let's remember that's still our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| Since this has come out in the media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| I have received phone calls from different people who have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| we have property and consider ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| It would be cheaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5754)|
| 1:35:55| It would be something that we should look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5755)|
| 1:36:00| For example, Mr. McSpadden sent me, and he says he's talked to Mr. Lawler about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5760)|
| 1:36:05| about property which is adjacent to West Town Mall, which already has apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5765)|
| 1:36:10| They're already leasing Section 8 housing, and it's on the bus line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5770)|
| 1:36:16| so there are a lot of amenities which could be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| I think that that should be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| I think that there should be others that should be considered as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| The last point I would make, and this would be to my fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| is let's look at the timeline on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5789)|
| 1:36:32| This became public November 3rd when they went before the West Knox Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5792)|
| 1:36:42| A hearing was held on November 12th, which was nine days later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5802)|
| 1:36:48| and now within about 72 hours we're being asked now to vote for $500,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5808)|
| 1:36:54| to purchase property that has been appraised by the Assessor's Office in the latest appraisal at $130,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5814)|
| 1:37:01| I would submit to you that if you do not feel that you can deny this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5821)|
| 1:37:06| I would submit that at least this needs to be delayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5826)|
| 1:37:10| so that we can properly look at this and properly look at alternative sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5830)|
| 1:37:15| Because if we are saying, let's go ahead and do this now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5835)|
| 1:37:21| when it hasn't been properly vetted, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5841)|
| 1:37:24| and we haven't looked at other properties and we haven't looked at the cost of these figures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5844)|
| 1:37:29| I just feel like we owe it to our citizens to step back and take a further look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5849)|
| 1:37:35| But I would also remind you too that if we're going to fast track these kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5855)|
| 1:37:40| when they come to your district and they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| we're going to come into your district and we want to put supportive housing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5863)|
| 1:37:48| and we're going to give you less than two weeks to evaluate it and vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5868)|
| 1:37:53| how are you going to react?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| So I would submit to you that the notion that somehow we in West Knoxville don't want this is not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5875)|
| 1:38:01| I'm all in favor of supportive housing and helping the homeless and people turning their lives around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| I want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5885)|
| 1:38:06| But I also want to be a good steward of the taxpayer dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| And to me, $500,000 for an appraised value of $130,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5889)|
| 1:38:13| we have less than 13 days from November 3rd, when it was first made public, to a vote today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5893)|
| 1:38:22| I just feel like it's being fast tracked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5902)|
| 1:38:25| I think we need to step back and look at it and either vote it down or postpone it 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for indulging me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5909)|
| 1:38:31| I probably spoke too long, but I wanted to get that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| Are you offering a postponement as a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5914)|
| 1:38:43| You can make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5925)|
| 1:38:46| I see some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| Let me think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| We may be just here today kind of putting a cart before the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5935)|
| 1:39:00| I'd like to ask John Lawler if he would come up and just kind of give us a landscape of where we are, where we're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5940)|
| 1:39:08| what's going on with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5948)|
| 1:39:11| Thank you, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5951)|
| 1:39:12| My name is John Lawler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5952)|
| 1:39:13| I'm the director of the 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| My address is 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| That's not where I live, but sometimes I wonder if that is where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5958)|
| 1:39:23| As you remember, let me paint the big picture and then talk about this specific property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5963)|
| 1:39:28| The big picture is the two mayors have commissioned our office to end chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5968)|
| 1:39:34| The tried and true strategy to do that is permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5974)|
| 1:39:38| an affordable housing unit with case management attached to it that helps chronically homeless individuals succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5978)|
| 1:39:45| You've heard the statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| Volunteer Ministries Center alone is seeing that 89% of the individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5987)|
| 1:39:53| formerly chronically homeless individuals that go into housing are there a year later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5993)|
| 1:39:58| You'll have to remember, too, that those individuals are very costly to us as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=5998)|
| 1:40:04| Us locally, it cost us about $30,000 in local dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6004)|
| 1:40:10| It cost us $40,000 altogether, but $30,000 local dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6010)|
| 1:40:15| The sheriff can talk to you about how much it cost him to house these individuals in the jail on and off again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6015)|
| 1:40:23| We can talk about the emergency room cost, on and on, local cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6023)|
| 1:40:28| because these individuals have not been assisted to get in the right housing and succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6028)|
| 1:40:33| Once they do, those costs disappear because there's a federal subsidy for their rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6033)|
| 1:40:38| They get disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| They get TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| And so those local costs that time in the sheriff's, in the jail, they have TennCare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6042)|
| 1:40:48| so they're not in the emergency rooms the way they used to be, we drastically reduce the local cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6048)|
| 1:40:54| So as we've gone out to partner with Southeastern Housing Foundation to develop permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6054)|
| 1:41:03| you well remember we were here to talk about MnVILA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| and you were generous enough to provide us with $250,000 of community development block grant funds for that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6066)|
| 1:41:13| We assembled 10 or 11 sources together in order to close that transaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6073)|
| 1:41:19| and workers are on that site today working towards rehabbing that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6079)|
| 1:41:24| and historically rehabbing that building at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| Then we went to Flinagan and had another tough fight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| and in both of those situations we heard the same thing, one from commission and one from city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6092)|
| 1:41:38| You've got to spread these things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| We do not believe that you're really going to push them beyond the urban core, concentration of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6100)|
| 1:41:46| We heard that here, we heard that at city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6106)|
| 1:41:49| So almost a year ago we began working with different realtors to identify property beyond the urban core,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6109)|
| 1:41:57| but really towards West Knoxville, because you've been to the community meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6117)|
| 1:42:03| and you heard everyone with regard to MnVILA, with regard to Flinagan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6123)|
| 1:42:08| they challenged us and really said, on the record, we'll never do one of these in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6128)|
| 1:42:17| So when Southeastern Housing Foundation, in coordinated work with a realtor, found this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6137)|
| 1:42:24| this was a very attractive site for several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| One, it is zoned multifamily, and we don't have to go through the zoning fight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6147)|
| 1:42:32| and that will never be easy, and any time we can avoid it, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6152)|
| 1:42:37| The other thing we liked about this site when Southeastern Housing began to talk to us about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6157)|
| 1:42:42| is that Southeastern Housing was able to develop a sales contract and get into an agreement with the owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6162)|
| 1:42:51| such that, and you've got to hear this because no one seems to be understanding this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6171)|
| 1:42:56| they will pay the lesser of a praise value, the lesser of a praise value, or $500,000, which was the list price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6176)|
| 1:43:06| This property, if it does appraise, as Commissioner Hammond spoke about, as low as he said, $125,000, so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6186)|
| 1:43:15| That's what they'll buy the property for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6195)|
| 1:43:17| If it appraises for more, that's what they'll buy the property for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6197)|
| 1:43:20| So market value is all we would ever expect you, as good stewards of the public's money, to agree to pay for property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6200)|
| 1:43:28| and that's what you'd be asked to pay for this, not necessarily $500,000 unless it appraises for $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6208)|
| 1:43:35| If it appraises for anything less, that's what you'll be asked to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6215)|
| 1:43:39| So we think this is a very fair proposition because, remember, 23 residents on that site cost us in local dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6219)|
| 1:43:49| $30,000 apiece, $690,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6229)|
| 1:43:53| We're going to invest in this property at fair market and build a development there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6233)|
| 1:43:59| where they'll be successfully housed and no longer be that drain on local dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6239)|
| 1:44:03| So that's the context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6243)|
| 1:44:05| That's how we think through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| And I'm here to answer any questions you may have about the development, our program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6247)|
| 1:44:14| or what our intended purposes are beyond what I've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6254)|
| 1:44:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| I appreciate you, again, just kind of laying the landscape for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| There's a couple, and I won't go way deep into this, but there's a couple things that I do want to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6263)|
| 1:44:31| And one was public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| We know this body has not endorsed, over the years, not just this body here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6273)|
| 1:44:38| we've not really endorsed public transportation out into the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6278)|
| 1:44:42| We don't have much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6282)|
| 1:44:43| There's very little public transportation that goes beyond the city border.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6283)|
| 1:44:47| So if we use that, if we hold that up as a mantra, say, hey, there's no buses, what are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6287)|
| 1:44:53| We're excluding certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6293)|
| 1:44:56| So let's not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6296)|
| 1:44:57| Let's say that, let's admit, we've not funded these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6297)|
| 1:45:02| We don't have a CAT to go out into our surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6302)|
| 1:45:08| It would be a great thing to have, but we don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| But let's not use that as a crutch or excuse to say this is why we shouldn't use it, this site or any site in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6310)|
| 1:45:18| So that's pretty much what we're saying when we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6318)|
| 1:45:21| We've bought into the scattered site approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6321)|
| 1:45:24| We have bought into that as an entity, as a city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6324)|
| 1:45:28| We've said that this is what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| And John's absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6330)|
| 1:45:31| I was one of the ones that grilled him on that, saying, you know, we need to spread this out a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6331)|
| 1:45:37| Because it is, it has historically been concentrated in a few areas here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6337)|
| 1:45:43| And the second thing, and I'll tend to, you know, I said this before, I'll say it again, you know, statistics are, you know, it's a monster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6343)|
| 1:45:52| We can use it to our advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| We can say we had a public meeting and two-thirds of the folks were against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6354)|
| 1:46:01| I don't like using that, or I've gotten all these emails for or against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6361)|
| 1:46:05| So, you know, if we count emails, I think there were two to one in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| So, you know, and I'm not using that as my sole source to make my decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6369)|
| 1:46:17| So trying not to get into the more emotional details of this, which I, you know, I do have some concerns with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6377)|
| 1:46:29| I just wanted to point out, let's look at this thing where it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6389)|
| 1:46:34| Let's look at our transportation where it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6394)|
| 1:46:37| So if we're going to support permanent supportive housing in all areas of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6397)|
| 1:46:42| we can't use these things as a crutch by land values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6402)|
| 1:46:48| We know land values are more in West Knoxville than they are in my district and primarily East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6408)|
| 1:46:54| That's just a statement of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6414)|
| 1:46:55| No one will argue that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| So if we hold transportation or land values up as the sole source, we can never do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6417)|
| 1:47:03| What are we saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6423)|
| 1:47:04| We're saying not in my backyard is what we end up saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| And I don't think that's what commission is saying, but I think that might be the message that goes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6427)|
| 1:47:12| So I just want to make sure, and I'm not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| not going to argue a delay or anything like that while we go out and get other values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| I do want to get the best value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| I think this process will give us the best value for that piece of property unless we need to throw the appraisal system out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6442)|
| 1:47:28| which I don't think we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| I think the appraisals will bear whatever fruit it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6450)|
| 1:47:34| But I just wanted to put those things out, a few things to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| We have quite a few lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| We're going to have to get a bit close to our five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6461)|
| 1:47:44| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6464)|
| 1:47:47| Funny how we always hold the five-minute mark when it's time for me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6467)|
| 1:47:54| But you never keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6474)|
| 1:47:56| I keep it a lot more often than you do, Mr. McKee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6476)|
| 1:47:59| All right, let's go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6479)|
| 1:48:01| There's two minutes gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| This is not about permanent supportive housing and whether we support permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6483)|
| 1:48:10| It's not about the scattered approach versus keeping things clustered downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6490)|
| 1:48:16| We know that permanent supportive housing works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6496)|
| 1:48:20| We know that it's not good to keep these things all clustered together in the core of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6500)|
| 1:48:26| We know that that hurts the redevelopment of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6506)|
| 1:48:30| And we know that it's not good to have all these folks with problems all clustered together to share in each other's problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6510)|
| 1:48:37| and pick up each other's bad habits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6517)|
| 1:48:40| This isn't about whether we support permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| or whether we support spreading these things out throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6524)|
| 1:48:48| It's about this particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| And here's what I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| It looks like we're trying to railroad this thing and move this thing quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| Because there's a mentality out there that we need to hurry up and get one of these in West Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6535)|
| 1:49:00| because they've never had one before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| And we've picked a bad site that is far too expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6542)|
| 1:49:06| This is taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6546)|
| 1:49:08| Just because we didn't raise those dollars doesn't mean that our great-grandchildren at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6548)|
| 1:49:15| with the way the federal administration is blowing money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6555)|
| 1:49:18| that our great-grandchildren are still going to have to pay all this money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6558)|
| 1:49:23| It's still taxpayer dollars, and we need to stand up for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| The other thing is it's not whether we're going to scatter these throughout the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6566)|
| 1:49:31| It's how are we going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| Are we going to have sites where bad sites are picked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6573)|
| 1:49:38| This is permanent supportive housing that isn't close to a permanent supportive grocery store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6578)|
| 1:49:44| but is awfully close to a permanent supportive liquor store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6584)|
| 1:49:47| People that have substance abuse problems need to be close to where they can get food to nourish their bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6587)|
| 1:49:53| not alcohol to add to their problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6593)|
| 1:49:56| It's not about whether we're going to have this housing in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6596)|
| 1:50:00| It's are we going to have this situation so far away from public transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6600)|
| 1:50:08| that the folks don't have a way to get to the store to get the things they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6608)|
| 1:50:13| This is a bad location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| It's being sprung on us too quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| And must I add that it's being done without including the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6617)|
| 1:50:22| This community has got representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6622)|
| 1:50:25| They serve on this board with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6625)|
| 1:50:27| The three commissioners from the fifth district should have been consulted before a site was chosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6627)|
| 1:50:34| I know that at some point the sixth district is going to have some permanent supportive housing in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6634)|
| 1:50:41| I understand that, and to a certain degree I support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6641)|
| 1:50:44| But when that happens, the commissioners in that district need to be included in the process where the site is chosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6644)|
| 1:50:52| And I want to say to the commissioners on here, we need to stand up today for our brethren in the fifth district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6652)|
| 1:50:59| because today they are trying to ram this down their throat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6659)|
| 1:51:02| Today they are springing a bad site that's going to cost way too much public dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6662)|
| 1:51:08| Today they're doing it to the fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6668)|
| 1:51:12| Next month, or the month after that, or the month after that, they're going to be doing it in our districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6672)|
| 1:51:18| And whether I'm sitting on this commission or not, the people of my community deserve to have their representatives consulted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6678)|
| 1:51:26| So I'm going to vote against this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6686)|
| 1:51:28| I'm not even going to vote to put it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| I think we all know that this is a bad site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| I think we all know that this site has problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6692)|
| 1:51:35| I think that we need to kill this thing today so that we can send a very strong message that when you go to put these plans together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6695)|
| 1:51:44| you need to include the people's representatives, which are the district commissioners from those particular districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6704)|
| 1:51:51| You need to take time to put these things together in a slow process where the people are included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6711)|
| 1:52:00| Not drop a side on us and less than half a month later expect us to vote it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6720)|
| 1:52:06| So I'm going to vote against this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| And I'm going to ask my colleagues that we need to stand up for our colleagues in the fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6728)|
| 1:52:13| And we need to kill this thing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| Not because I want to stop permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| Not because I want to stop the scattered approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| But because I want to show them that the way you did it this time isn't going to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6742)|
| 1:52:27| and you need to try it another way next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6747)|
| 1:52:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6750)|
| 1:52:41| Commissioner Pinkston, I will be voting against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6761)|
| 1:52:46| But I would like for everybody here to know the reason I'm voting against it and I'm against this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6766)|
| 1:52:55| We just put 58, I believe, in South Knoxville and 53 in the Fifth Avenue Motel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6775)|
| 1:53:03| I've heard the commissioners from the fifth district talk about how expensive this is down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6783)|
| 1:53:11| Those little efficiencies in the Fifth Avenue Motel were $125,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6791)|
| 1:53:16| These are going to be $85,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6796)|
| 1:53:19| This is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6799)|
| 1:53:20| We're spending too much money on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6800)|
| 1:53:21| I'm not against helping the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6801)|
| 1:53:24| But there's cheaper and better avenues to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6804)|
| 1:53:28| I think we could buy 12 houses, would take care of 24 people, two in each house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6808)|
| 1:53:34| scatter them all throughout the county, and it would put these people in a better environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6814)|
| 1:53:39| Now, 58 and 53 together, they're going to feed off each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6819)|
| 1:53:43| It's just like me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| I realize these people have problems and I really think our state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6825)|
| 1:53:48| and our federal government need to get back into mental health issues, taking that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6828)|
| 1:53:54| But two rights don't make a wrong, so I'm going to vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6834)|
| 1:53:58| One thing I would like to know, Mr. Lawler, would you step up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6838)|
| 1:54:05| Was this put out on bid, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6845)|
| 1:54:10| Was the purchase of property put out on bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| Yeah, did we put out, did you put out something that you were wanting to buy some property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6852)|
| 1:54:15| Was it put out on a bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| How did we arrive at this location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6857)|
| 1:54:20| We worked with different realtors in town and we gave them site selection criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6860)|
| 1:54:25| One of those criteria was it needed to be zoned for multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6865)|
| 1:54:31| Now, I understand that, but we've got this site right there that they just talked about behind West Town Mall there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6871)|
| 1:54:38| that's already zoned for that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6878)|
| 1:54:44| Existing apartment complex, the thing about vacant land or a vacant building that works for the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6884)|
| 1:54:52| is the fact that those kind of properties the developer can get an option on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6892)|
| 1:54:57| It is very difficult to get a long-term option on an existing apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6897)|
| 1:55:03| The developer that has partnered with us doesn't have a large amount of capital to tie these things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6903)|
| 1:55:09| It takes about a year to put the funding sources together going through the low-income housing tax credit cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6909)|
| 1:55:15| So to answer your question about did we put this out for bid, that's a confusing question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6915)|
| 1:55:19| because I don't know if I've ever seen acquiring property be put out to bid before when you're just looking for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6919)|
| 1:55:26| Well, I mean, you sent out things that you were interested in property, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6926)|
| 1:55:29| Oh, yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6929)|
| 1:55:30| Well, why did you not, the piece of property down there that the guy offered you behind West Town Mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6930)|
| 1:55:36| it's suited for Section 8 housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6936)|
| 1:55:38| Why was that not considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6938)|
| 1:55:40| At what price?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6940)|
| 1:55:41| Was the price too high or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| Oh, it was never offered to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6943)|
| 1:55:44| It was not on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6944)|
| 1:55:47| Oh, he didn't talk to you about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6947)|
| 1:55:49| Maybe I misunderstood Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6949)|
| 1:55:52| Since this discussion has gone public, especially with the statements being made in error again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6952)|
| 1:56:00| and again that we could pay as much as $250,000 per acre, we've gotten a lot of calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6960)|
| 1:56:06| And so Mr. McSpadden gave me a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6966)|
| 1:56:09| I wish I had some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6969)|
| 1:56:10| You'd have got one from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6970)|
| 1:56:11| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6971)|
| 1:56:12| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6972)|
| 1:56:13| It's surprising how popular we've become.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6973)|
| 1:56:15| But, yes, I've talked to Mr. McSpadden through e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6975)|
| 1:56:19| I even went out to the property yesterday to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6979)|
| 1:56:22| It's an apartment complex and some vacant land on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6982)|
| 1:56:25| So we're going to have an opportunity to look at a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6985)|
| 1:56:28| But the thing we like about that, again, is that it is zoned correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6988)|
| 1:56:32| But what we have to remember is there are currently 700 chronically homeless individuals in our community that lack housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=6992)|
| 1:56:41| So it's going to take a lot of pieces of property and a lot of developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7001)|
| 1:56:46| using existing affordable housing but developing new, to do what you've commissioned us to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7006)|
| 1:56:51| which is end chronic homelessness through permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7011)|
| 1:56:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7014)|
| 1:56:55| Let's get off of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7015)|
| 1:56:56| We're putting over 100 of them in two locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7016)|
| 1:56:59| That's more than one-seventh right there of the 700.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| Well, we started around 900 chronically homeless individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7022)|
| 1:57:06| Who's going to keep this property up after it's bought?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7026)|
| 1:57:09| Well, the owner of the property will have a management company to make sure the rules are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7029)|
| 1:57:16| Who's going to own the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7036)|
| 1:57:17| Southeastern Housing Foundation, the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| That's an LLC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7039)|
| 1:57:20| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7040)|
| 1:57:21| Who are the corporate people in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7041)|
| 1:57:25| The chief manager of that LLC is Chris Martin, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7045)|
| 1:57:29| But it's a single-member LLC of the Knoxville Leadership Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7049)|
| 1:57:34| It's a nonprofit entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7054)|
| 1:57:37| Now, you said at the finance meeting that this developer had a 14-month option on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7057)|
| 1:57:44| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7064)|
| 1:57:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7065)|
| 1:57:46| Would it be unethical for me to ask what his option was per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7066)|
| 1:57:51| I think his option is for he'll have $40,000 in it at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7071)|
| 1:57:56| He has a 60-day look-see, so no money at risk for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7076)|
| 1:58:01| Then he goes hard with 20 and then 20 more soon to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7081)|
| 1:58:04| What I'm asking, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| Commissioner Kingston, what did he give for the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7086)|
| 1:58:12| I believe I have five minutes according to commission rules and three after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7092)|
| 1:58:16| Then you've gone with six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7096)|
| 1:58:17| Okay, I'll wrap it up then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7097)|
| 1:58:18| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7098)|
| 1:58:19| I didn't expect to get an answer anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| I can't provide an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| The question was what did the developer pay for the option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7104)|
| 1:58:31| No, what he's paying for the property, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7111)|
| 1:58:34| The real estate contract that I think was in your packet is very clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7114)|
| 1:58:39| He has agreed to pay the lesser of the appraised value or $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7119)|
| 1:58:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7127)|
| 1:58:48| That wasn't his question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7128)|
| 1:58:49| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7129)|
| 1:58:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7132)|
| 1:58:53| I think his question, John, before he sat down, was how much is the developer paying for the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7133)|
| 1:58:58| What does he have an option for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7138)|
| 1:59:00| That's what I asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7140)|
| 1:59:01| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7141)|
| 1:59:02| Anyway, the thing that bothers me about this, first off, let me say I believe in the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7142)|
| 1:59:10| but I believe in doing it properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| Thirteen days from, as we say when I was building the Habitat House,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7153)|
| 1:59:21| when we did the blitz bills, we did seven days from dirt to dedication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7161)|
| 1:59:27| But 13 days for a project like this, this doesn't do anybody either side justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7167)|
| 1:59:35| There's not time to vet it through the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7175)|
| 1:59:39| And I would agree with a couple of people that said that this should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7179)|
| 1:59:45| the commissioners for that district should be involved from the get-go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7185)|
| 1:59:49| They need to know what's going on with their district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7189)|
| 1:59:53| The fact that maybe you're dealing with one developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7193)|
| 1:59:58| Had you put a notice out, I mean, everybody else, the federal government, Oak Ridge, everybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7198)|
| 2:00:03| when they want something, they put out a bid notice in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7203)|
| 2:00:07| I'm looking for this, for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| I need some property in such and such a quadrant, what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7210)|
| 2:00:17| And I know, John, I wouldn't have your job for the world, because you're kind of like the executioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7217)|
| 2:00:28| We need to get you a hood and an axe, but it's a tough job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7228)|
| 2:00:33| Somebody's got to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7233)|
| 2:00:35| But being able to go to the people and being everybody involved up front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7235)|
| 2:00:45| then you don't have as many problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7245)|
| 2:00:47| Here this has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7247)|
| 2:00:48| And the same thing happened until we slowed the process down when you guys came south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7248)|
| 2:00:58| And at that point I was as opposed to it as the three commissioners from the fifth were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7258)|
| 2:01:05| because I don't think it was too much in one location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7265)|
| 2:01:14| The success of this program, from what I understand, has been in smaller units, six and eight to a unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7274)|
| 2:01:22| It doesn't impact the community to the point where it raises the community up in arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7282)|
| 2:01:28| Like in our case, 48, in this case you're going to have, was it 33 or 23?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7288)|
| 2:01:40| 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7300)|
| 2:01:42| 23 in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7302)|
| 2:01:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7303)|
| 2:01:44| But still, that has a higher impact on a particular part of a community than six or eight do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7304)|
| 2:01:53| You talked about the bus situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7313)|
| 2:01:56| The cat doesn't come out into the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7316)|
| 2:01:59| I know they came out, Kingston Pike a long time before they came out to Chapman Highway in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7319)|
| 2:02:07| because the city, in their infinite wisdom, decided to finger annex right down to Pike so they could get that tax money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7327)|
| 2:02:13| just like they did finally come out to Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7333)|
| 2:02:16| But we've got buses now coming our way out to John Sevier Highway in the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7336)|
| 2:02:20| And I'm sure, I don't know, how close are they coming to this property out west?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7340)|
| 2:02:26| Currently, they're going as far as Cooksbury Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7346)|
| 2:02:30| So I would, just a general estimate, I would say it's probably a mile away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7350)|
| 2:02:36| John, just to correct you, it's Cooksbury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7356)|
| 2:02:39| Cooksbury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7359)|
| 2:02:40| Got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7360)|
| 2:02:42| And you mentioned you're only looking for properties that are zoned for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7362)|
| 2:02:47| We have the authority up here to change zonings if it's necessary, if it fits the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7367)|
| 2:02:54| But I'm a firm believer in planning, and it should still fit the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7374)|
| 2:02:59| But some of these issues could have been avoided had we taken the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7379)|
| 2:03:08| and maybe we need to develop a process for this that says, step one, we do this, two, we do this, three, we do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7388)|
| 2:03:14| so that everybody knows what game we're playing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7394)|
| 2:03:18| I think that's a big problem with this whole process right now, that nobody knows all of the rules of the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7398)|
| 2:03:27| And once you start a story, I can tell Bud something, and he passes it around the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7407)|
| 2:03:33| The time it got to Sam over there, you couldn't recognize the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7413)|
| 2:03:37| Not that my fellow commissioners don't listen, but you've all played that game, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7417)|
| 2:03:44| We need to wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7424)|
| 2:03:45| Commissioner Burrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7425)|
| 2:03:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7426)|
| 2:03:47| I'd just like to say that I think we're going too fast, and based on what I've heard here today, I can't support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7427)|
| 2:03:57| Commissioner Burrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7437)|
| 2:04:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| One thing that seems to keep getting lost is that what we have agreed to with this contract is to pay fair market value for this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7444)|
| 2:04:18| And I think we all know that $500,000 is overpriced for this land, but that's not what we're being asked to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7458)|
| 2:04:25| We're being asked to pay fair market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7465)|
| 2:04:32| And if we're all uncertain about what fair market value is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7472)|
| 2:04:37| then maybe we do need to slow down and get a certified appraisal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7477)|
| 2:04:41| because that's what it's going to take is a certified appraisal to see what that fair market value is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7481)|
| 2:04:49| because that's what we are agreeing to is the fair market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7489)|
| 2:04:57| I think that we need to realize that the scattered site approach to permanent supportive housing with, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7497)|
| 2:05:08| the optimum number in best practices is around 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7508)|
| 2:05:12| You don't want to get much more than that or much less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7512)|
| 2:05:15| But that has been shown in best practices to be the optimum number for success in permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7515)|
| 2:05:24| I think also that, John, we've heard a lot of people say that this property just isn't right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7524)|
| 2:05:31| that it's a bad location for these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7531)|
| 2:05:37| I don't think that John or Southeastern Housing would have brought this forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7537)|
| 2:05:46| that they were setting the residents up for failure or if they were setting the community up for harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7546)|
| 2:05:55| I just don't think that that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7555)|
| 2:05:58| Would you like to speak, John, to what people are feeling like are problems that there's not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7558)|
| 2:06:03| I mean, we've already said transportation is really not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7563)|
| 2:06:07| That can be solved fairly easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7567)|
| 2:06:11| What about the other concerns that people have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7571)|
| 2:06:14| I don't want to minimize any aspect of developing a property, especially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7574)|
| 2:06:19| and I guess I could if I'm speaking for David, but I don't want to do that to David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7579)|
| 2:06:23| All forms of development are difficult, whether on this property it's going to be figuring out the transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7583)|
| 2:06:29| That's one of the many challenges we knew we would have when we go into the deeper parts of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7589)|
| 2:06:36| In fact, I think it was in a discussion with you, I made that point in talking about going west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7596)|
| 2:06:41| when we were talking about the Menvilla Project, and you talked about being of assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7601)|
| 2:06:46| and helping us with vans and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7606)|
| 2:06:48| We kind of laughed about that and said, I'll be back to you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| So transportation is difficult, but this site in and of itself is a good site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7611)|
| 2:06:58| There are several aspects of this site that we liked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7618)|
| 2:07:03| One of them in particular was it is within relative short distance of Cherokee Health Center's West Knoxville location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7623)|
| 2:07:12| and Cherokee Health Center is a great strategic partner of the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7632)|
| 2:07:18| The behavioral health care they provide, whether it's at VMC or whether it's at their West Knoxville location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7638)|
| 2:07:24| is an important part of helping residents succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7644)|
| 2:07:26| So there are several things we liked about the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7646)|
| 2:07:31| So when we first saw it, we knew it would be a successful site for permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7651)|
| 2:07:38| Another point I would like to make is that, and we ran into this problem when we were working on the Menvilla Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7658)|
| 2:07:45| is that we have to abide by the Fair Housing Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7665)|
| 2:07:50| Now, we have recognized that best practices advocate for scattered site approach to permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7670)|
| 2:07:58| We have an appropriately zoned piece of property that does meet enough criteria to be an acceptable place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7678)|
| 2:08:06| to build permanent supportive housing, and our contract is to pay fair market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7686)|
| 2:08:13| If we say that we are not willing to pay fair market value for an appropriately zoned piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7693)|
| 2:08:21| which is an appropriate location according to the experts on this, which are not us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7701)|
| 2:08:29| the experts are the people who run the 10-year plan and who run the partner associations with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7709)|
| 2:08:35| that they say is an appropriate place for permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7715)|
| 2:08:40| then we are saying that we are excluding a protected group of people from a particular part of our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7720)|
| 2:08:48| and that is in violation of the Fair Housing Act, and we're opening ourselves up to a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7728)|
| 2:08:53| And that's something that we all need to take very serious consideration on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7733)|
| 2:09:01| John, is there anything else you'd like to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7741)|
| 2:09:05| No, I don't have anything to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7745)|
| 2:09:08| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7748)|
| 2:09:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7750)|
| 2:09:12| John, I have one question for you, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7752)|
| 2:09:14| I asked you on Tuesday if you would bring some numbers for me related to the success rate after one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7754)|
| 2:09:21| You said it would be 89 percent for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7761)|
| 2:09:24| I asked you what it would be for five years or so, for a little more out into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7764)|
| 2:09:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7768)|
| 2:09:29| We use something called HMIS, everything in government is an acronym.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7769)|
| 2:09:35| It's called our Homeless Management Information System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7775)|
| 2:09:39| We've been logging in for approximately 18 months now is all the data associated with housing placement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7779)|
| 2:09:47| So I can't go back because we operate on the same fiscal year you guys do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7787)|
| 2:09:52| and so we've been about a year and a half doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7792)|
| 2:09:55| So I can't go back two years to give you the exact numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7795)|
| 2:09:59| But the numbers we have for that 18-month period are very similar to what we're seeing for a year right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7799)|
| 2:10:08| I'm not sure what BMC versus the others, but they're the mid-80s for that 18-month period that we show in HMIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7808)|
| 2:10:17| Thank you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| A few comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7819)|
| 2:10:20| Number one, Commissioner Hammond brought out, I think, some really excellent points as it relates to other opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7820)|
| 2:10:27| I don't know why we always have to go build things, and I don't know why it has to be good for the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7827)|
| 2:10:34| That really concerns me that we're looking at it to be good for the developer and not good for the homeless people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7834)|
| 2:10:44| I've also had a lot of calls from even the 8th District, believe it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7844)|
| 2:10:48| and even some people from the 7th District saying, I've got 80 acres I'll sell you, and they're in really good proximity to everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7848)|
| 2:10:57| They may not be zoned correctly, but if let's make an assumption the Fair Housing Act applies, then zoning is not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7857)|
| 2:11:04| If it's falling under that, then we can probably get it rezoned without being spot zoned without violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7864)|
| 2:11:11| But I'm not so sure that it applies the way we're being talked to about it being applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7871)|
| 2:11:15| I'll ask the law director here in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7875)|
| 2:11:17| The second point is that Patty Jo and I go out to buy a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7877)|
| 2:11:22| I'm not going to sign a contract saying I'm going to buy it at fair market value before I know what fair market value is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7882)|
| 2:11:29| I just have a real hard time thinking that one through, especially if I'm going to have to come to somebody at the bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7889)|
| 2:11:36| and say I need to borrow, oh, between $130,000 and, oh, between a half million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7896)|
| 2:11:43| And would you approve that for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7903)|
| 2:11:46| I have a real hard time getting my hands around that idea, even for government, when we're kind of more loosey than most people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7906)|
| 2:11:53| But, you know, I come from the old school of making sure I understand what I'm dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7913)|
| 2:11:59| I'm not against the program, but I really have a real hard time with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7919)|
| 2:12:06| I walked the site the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7926)|
| 2:12:09| We haven't done an environmental assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7929)|
| 2:12:11| There's federal dollars tied to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7931)|
| 2:12:13| There's some geological issues that just jumped right out in my face in a hurry there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7933)|
| 2:12:20| And I'm not going to talk about the socioeconomic issues that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7940)|
| 2:12:23| I think a lot of people have already talked about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7943)|
| 2:12:26| We haven't had the necessary public hearings that if we're going to use federal dollars that I think we should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7946)|
| 2:12:33| I think this is on the fast track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7953)|
| 2:12:35| I don't know why it's on the fast track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7955)|
| 2:12:37| We're paying the $30,000 to house them as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7957)|
| 2:12:41| The facility is not their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7961)|
| 2:12:42| It's the only difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7962)|
| 2:12:44| So I'm really not too supportive of this one, John, at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7964)|
| 2:12:49| I think there are other better locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7969)|
| 2:12:52| I don't think that even the proximity to the health care, if we're going to scatter approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7972)|
| 2:12:58| and we're going to have an anchor to Cherokee, then the 8th District is out of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7978)|
| 2:13:05| If we're going to use a scattered approach and we're going to anchor to a hospital, then the 7th District could be in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7985)|
| 2:13:15| I would recommend there are some really good people over at the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7995)|
| 2:13:19| especially in the geography department, that are just super, super people on locational theory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=7999)|
| 2:13:24| I mean, they study things like Christaller central place theory and von Thunen sectorial theory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8004)|
| 2:13:31| or Burgess sectorial theories and things as to how you locate different economic rent and activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8011)|
| 2:13:38| and what's the thresholds that are necessary for us to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8018)|
| 2:13:42| I haven't heard anybody talk to me about any of that stuff other than, well, we think it's a good site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8022)|
| 2:13:47| I know we have people saying that you all have the experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8027)|
| 2:13:51| What I've heard is we've had real estate people trying to find a location based upon some criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8031)|
| 2:13:58| that I'm not really sure what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8038)|
| 2:14:01| I'd recommend that we go back to first base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8041)|
| 2:14:03| I'd recommend that we take a deep breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8043)|
| 2:14:06| I recommend that we find some cost-effective property and maybe even look at the game plan that we're using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8046)|
| 2:14:14| Do we have to always buy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8054)|
| 2:14:16| Can we get a long-term lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8056)|
| 2:14:18| And if we get these people healthy and wealthy, maybe we can move them to, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8058)|
| 2:14:21| habitat for humanity in the next step in the puzzle where they become equity, sweat equity owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8061)|
| 2:14:27| I mean, we don't have to stick to the model of, I hate the word best practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8067)|
| 2:14:32| because usually best practices means somebody else is doing it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8072)|
| 2:14:36| It doesn't mean it's the best way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8076)|
| 2:14:38| So I'm really not going to be voting for this one tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8078)|
| 2:14:42| I think it's not cost-effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8082)|
| 2:14:43| I think it just doesn't feel right to me, and if I'm going to be emotional about things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8083)|
| 2:14:49| and I'm going to go about the feeling, I'm going to go economic feeling, not emotional feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8089)|
| 2:14:53| And I don't think it's good for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8093)|
| 2:14:56| The people have spoken on short-term notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8096)|
| 2:14:58| Economically, I don't think it's a good move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8098)|
| 2:15:01| I think we need to get more for our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8101)|
| 2:15:03| I've had a guy offer 80 acres within your criteria for a reasonable amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8103)|
| 2:15:09| He called me on the phone last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8109)|
| 2:15:11| I'll be glad to give you his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8111)|
| 2:15:13| I know where there's 30 other acres that are less than a mile from transit that's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8113)|
| 2:15:19| It could probably be rezoned real easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8119)|
| 2:15:22| The only problem is that the owner may have a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8122)|
| 2:15:26| But there's plenty of opportunity from what I hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8126)|
| 2:15:28| I had a man talk to me the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8128)|
| 2:15:30| I need to wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8130)|
| 2:15:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8131)|
| 2:15:32| I had a man talk to me the other night and said, you know, there's people that stand in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8132)|
| 2:15:36| I'm not talking a half million dollars, I mean a quarter million dollars an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8136)|
| 2:15:39| I'm talking fair market value where we know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8139)|
| 2:15:42| I'll shut up right now and I think we need to go ahead and vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8142)|
| 2:15:53| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8153)|
| 2:15:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8156)|
| 2:15:58| Let's review some of the things that have been said about this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8158)|
| 2:16:03| and see where the arguments don't really hold up all that well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8163)|
| 2:16:07| And let us see if the conclusions aren't driving the reasoning instead of the reverse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8167)|
| 2:16:12| First was brief mention of sidewalks as a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8172)|
| 2:16:16| If we limited our permanent supportive housing locations to places with sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8176)|
| 2:16:21| that's a very small portion of our housing stock, predominantly inner city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8181)|
| 2:16:26| and in effect a very discriminatory way of approaching how to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8186)|
| 2:16:30| The second thing that was mentioned briefly, again in passing, was karst geology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8190)|
| 2:16:35| which is all over this area, which everyone who builds a building has to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8195)|
| 2:16:39| It didn't stop us on Midway Road, it doesn't have to stop us on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8199)|
| 2:16:43| The third issue that was mentioned more elaborately was transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8203)|
| 2:16:48| But facilities like this can and have designed their own shuttle bus systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8208)|
| 2:16:52| Facilities like this can and have been served by easy extension of existing lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8212)|
| 2:16:57| and there is an existing line that can be extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8217)|
| 2:17:01| And we have the convenience to the health services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8221)|
| 2:17:04| which is an added reason that transport is not a major factor standing in the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8224)|
| 2:17:11| The big factor that people keep mentioning is cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8231)|
| 2:17:14| But at that meeting we attended, we have seen and heard from various good studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8234)|
| 2:17:20| Dr. Noe's, others, a dozen of them all over the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8240)|
| 2:17:24| that when you have persons in permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8244)|
| 2:17:28| it substantially reduces the cost to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8248)|
| 2:17:31| Because when you have persons outside of permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8251)|
| 2:17:35| the public cost, jailing, emergency room visits, etc., uncompensated stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8255)|
| 2:17:43| runs around $40,000 per person a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| And we learned at the meetings that in permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8265)|
| 2:17:48| that reduces to $12,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8268)|
| 2:17:50| That's a savings of $28,000 per person times 23 occupants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8270)|
| 2:17:54| So in the first year of full operation, this thing saves more public dollars than it costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8274)|
| 2:17:59| Let's admit that to ourselves, that cost is another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8279)|
| 2:18:02| although seemingly impressive, actually bogus argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8282)|
| 2:18:06| And the final point is, well, there are other locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8286)|
| 2:18:09| Good. We're going to need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8289)|
| 2:18:11| There are hundreds of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8291)|
| 2:18:13| Keep a list of those locations listed, because there are still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8293)|
| 2:18:17| maybe even after we do this, maybe 600 people, 650 people in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8297)|
| 2:18:21| still ready for and needing permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8301)|
| 2:18:25| So when you look at the reasons presented, they don't add up to a solid reason to vote against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8305)|
| 2:18:32| None of them hold up to close inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8312)|
| 2:18:35| We are one community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8315)|
| 2:18:36| Let us not be fearful of our neighbors, and let us not hide that fear in bogus reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8316)|
| 2:18:45| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8325)|
| 2:18:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8327)|
| 2:18:50| One of the things I've discovered as I have become a commissioner is that we in county government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8330)|
| 2:18:57| and city government have some really good department heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8337)|
| 2:19:01| and people that work for the citizens of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8341)|
| 2:19:06| I think Mr. Lawler and Mr. Arning are in that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8346)|
| 2:19:12| We have two gentlemen here who are well-versed in development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8352)|
| 2:19:18| and I have learned, and I think I haven't been betrayed yet, to trust those servants that work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8358)|
| 2:19:28| And when Mr. Lawler tells me that this can be a very fair deal, I believe him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8368)|
| 2:19:37| We have given them, the 10-year plan people, the instructions to disperse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8377)|
| 2:19:44| And we've been more specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8384)|
| 2:19:45| We have asked them to go west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8385)|
| 2:19:48| They have done exactly what we asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8388)|
| 2:19:51| I'm going to support them in this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8391)|
| 2:19:53| I think they have come up with a good spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8393)|
| 2:19:55| The other issues, as Mr. Harmon just noted, are solvable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8395)|
| 2:20:01| I think we need to move forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8401)|
| 2:20:06| Commissioner Nauman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8406)|
| 2:20:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8408)|
| 2:20:11| I'm starting to become more familiar with the 10-year plan, the document itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8411)|
| 2:20:16| And the more that I know about it, the more comfortable I get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8416)|
| 2:20:22| And I've spoken to Dr. Noe and asked him some questions in reference to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8422)|
| 2:20:28| And these are good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8428)|
| 2:20:30| I'd highly recommend the document to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8430)|
| 2:20:34| It's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8434)|
| 2:20:37| There's a number of, the first thing that jumps out at me is this notion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8437)|
| 2:20:45| that Mr. Saunders' mission is the notion of trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8445)|
| 2:20:49| And certainly my tendency is to trust those people who are involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8449)|
| 2:20:56| They've dedicated their lives to this issue, Mr. Lawler, his staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8456)|
| 2:21:01| and the people that are closest to the plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8461)|
| 2:21:05| They live and breathe this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8465)|
| 2:21:12| I trust them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8472)|
| 2:21:14| I trust that their decisions that they're making are the absolute best that they can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8474)|
| 2:21:21| and they represent this community well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| Now, that does not mean that I don't have some questions about process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8483)|
| 2:21:29| Now, we know that this is in the first stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8489)|
| 2:21:35| We're still in the first stages, especially of the effort to disperse these units throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8495)|
| 2:21:43| This is a bumpy road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8503)|
| 2:21:46| And some of the bumps have to do with commission, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8506)|
| 2:21:53| I know in the process or part of the process was originally to include the commission very early on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8513)|
| 2:22:00| Well, I think maybe the misbehavior of the commission a couple of years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8520)|
| 2:22:06| was part of that being sought to be maybe unwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8526)|
| 2:22:13| So I can understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8533)|
| 2:22:14| Nevertheless, I mean, the point being made that commissioners need to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8534)|
| 2:22:20| They need to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8540)|
| 2:22:22| But I see that as a bump and not something that necessarily should thwart the whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8542)|
| 2:22:35| There are a few questions that I would like to ask John, if you don't mind, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8555)|
| 2:22:44| The site selection, to me, to say that it's not the right place at not the right price, that's really quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8564)|
| 2:22:56| because I know you all work very hard at trying to find this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8576)|
| 2:23:03| So one of the ideas that I think that makes some of us draw back a bit is the site selection process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8583)|
| 2:23:13| Could you talk specifically about this site and the criteria that you used for this site selection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8593)|
| 2:23:23| If you don't mind, let me defer that to David Arnie because he is the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8603)|
| 2:23:27| And David and I, of course, partner on all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8607)|
| 2:23:30| But he's the guy in the air traffic control tower when it comes to site selection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8610)|
| 2:23:35| and putting funding together and all that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8615)|
| 2:23:37| So let me defer to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8617)|
| 2:23:41| I'm David Arnie with Southeastern Housing Foundation, 901 East Summit Hill Drive, 37915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8621)|
| 2:23:48| Commissioner Norman, I think we've touched on a lot of those today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8628)|
| 2:23:53| Zoning, while to some it may not seem to be a big obstacle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8633)|
| 2:24:00| I would suggest that we were one city council vote away from filing a Fair Housing Act lawsuit for zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8640)|
| 2:24:08| that by all legal and planning standards should have been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8648)|
| 2:24:14| It is a tremendous obstacle, and I think it's a false hope to think that there's a perfect site out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8654)|
| 2:24:19| So let me preface my comments with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8659)|
| 2:24:21| Zoning, transit is an important factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8661)|
| 2:24:26| Services, both for homeless or individuals who have been homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8666)|
| 2:24:31| and keep in mind, too, that those needs change once someone's housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8671)|
| 2:24:37| Hopefully those services are ongoing, you know, medical or case management, social services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8677)|
| 2:24:42| but they're not going down to the shelter for a place to sleep and a meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8682)|
| 2:24:48| Amenities, I mean, this will sound like an oversimplification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8688)|
| 2:24:52| but these folks are looking for a home, and they're looking to start over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8692)|
| 2:24:56| and so they're looking for communities just like you and I would if we were looking for a place to live and to rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8696)|
| 2:25:02| They want a place that they're going to be comfortable, probably socioeconomically, but also a good quality place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8702)|
| 2:25:10| David, if, and I'm sure in the process, there's multiple sites that were considered, and in that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8710)|
| 2:25:20| and I know you have to be careful to not be too obvious and have the price driven up artificially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8720)|
| 2:25:33| but other sites that were not chosen, what were primary in that consideration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8733)|
| 2:25:43| Well, I will tell you, we looked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8743)|
| 2:25:47| I started in February of 2008, and since I've been here, we've been looking all over the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8747)|
| 2:25:52| Since February of this year, we've really focused our efforts on West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8752)|
| 2:25:59| Since then, this is the first site that we have found that we thought was suitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8759)|
| 2:26:04| and that we could acquire that it was available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8764)|
| 2:26:07| A lot of this, too, it would be nice if we could look at a big map and go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8767)|
| 2:26:12| and identify all the sites that we're going to need and lock them up and sort of be done with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8772)|
| 2:26:16| and everybody would have a good comprehensive picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8776)|
| 2:26:19| But we don't, Southeastern Housing doesn't have the resources to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8779)|
| 2:26:23| and so that's one of our challenges, and a lot of this is simply opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8783)|
| 2:26:27| We looked at a property I can think of specifically that was out west, had a good location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8787)|
| 2:26:34| It was existing units, and part of the problem we had there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8794)|
| 2:26:37| in addition to a price that was too high and a seller that wasn't really motivated to sell, were some HUD issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8797)|
| 2:26:46| When we use federal dollars, we have environmental review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8806)|
| 2:26:49| which involves not just physical environmental issues, but also noise, floodplains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8809)|
| 2:26:56| and those were two in particular that excluded this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8816)|
| 2:26:59| That's just one example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8819)|
| 2:27:01| Folks get frustrated when I say that we've looked at dozens of sites and then don't tell them where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8821)|
| 2:27:07| Frankly, I don't want phone calls from a dozen different neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8827)|
| 2:27:11| like we've gotten with the property Mr. Schubert offered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8831)|
| 2:27:15| from surrounding neighborhoods asking if they should sell their house now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8835)|
| 2:27:21| It's a lot of different factors, but unfortunately there's not a perfect site out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8841)|
| 2:27:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8846)|
| 2:27:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8847)|
| 2:27:28| Commissioner Allman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8848)|
| 2:27:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8849)|
| 2:27:30| Can I just wrap up with one statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8850)|
| 2:27:33| At the meeting at Strang the other night, I remember Mr. Hammond was one of the first ones to speak from the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8853)|
| 2:27:42| and he offered the idea that this should be, because it is, it's too quick for whatever reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8862)|
| 2:27:50| for a lot of these reasons we've talked about, it's just too quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8870)|
| 2:27:53| He got an outstanding amount of applause and approval from the crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8873)|
| 2:27:59| And so for that reason, and because I don't think we've had enough information to say whether this is the right place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8879)|
| 2:28:07| or the right price, I think that's the wise thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8887)|
| 2:28:12| So I hope that that's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8892)|
| 2:28:13| I hope we defer this and we can really say whether it is or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8893)|
| 2:28:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8898)|
| 2:28:21| Commissioner Broad, you have a three-minute wrap-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8901)|
| 2:28:25| This won't take that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8905)|
| 2:28:26| I just wanted to agree with Tony that there are some people who feel like this is moving too quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8906)|
| 2:28:34| and there are some people who will not commit to fair market price until they are absolutely certain what fair market price is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8914)|
| 2:28:42| So probably the wisest course at this point would be to defer this for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8922)|
| 2:28:47| to give everybody a chance to learn more about this site and to get a certified appraisal done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8927)|
| 2:28:53| so we know exactly the dollar amount that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8933)|
| 2:28:56| So I'm going to make that in the form of a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8936)|
| 2:29:06| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8946)|
| 2:29:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8950)|
| 2:29:13| Just a comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8953)|
| 2:29:15| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8955)|
| 2:29:19| Are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8959)|
| 2:29:21| You finished, Commissioner Broad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8961)|
| 2:29:23| I'll hold your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8963)|
| 2:29:24| I think Tony Norman's light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8964)|
| 2:29:26| His light is on over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8966)|
| 2:29:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8967)|
| 2:29:28| I just wanted to speak to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8968)|
| 2:29:34| Commissioner Hamlin first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8974)|
| 2:29:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8975)|
| 2:29:36| I'll defer to Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8976)|
| 2:29:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8977)|
| 2:29:38| I thought that it might be wise, if it is the mood of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8978)|
| 2:29:44| to make this length of time a little bit longer, maybe 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8984)|
| 2:29:50| That way we get through the holidays and we can take it back up in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8990)|
| 2:29:54| It gives us a little more time to digest information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8994)|
| 2:29:58| So that would be my preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=8998)|
| 2:30:02| Could I speak to that suggestion or recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9002)|
| 2:30:06| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9006)|
| 2:30:07| One of the time constraints is our contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9007)|
| 2:30:09| The way it's written, we have essentially a 60-day free look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9009)|
| 2:30:12| or due diligence period before any of the earnest money, the option money, goes hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9012)|
| 2:30:18| That would get us through next month's commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9018)|
| 2:30:22| but I believe that expires January 1st or January 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9022)|
| 2:30:25| So at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9025)|
| 2:30:27| Southeastern Housing would need to put up $40,000 at risk to keep that property under option through the end of 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9027)|
| 2:30:36| We are not in a position to do that without the funds that we're requesting here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9036)|
| 2:30:42| Did you want to go next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9042)|
| 2:30:44| Can I ask him a question while he's up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9044)|
| 2:30:46| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9046)|
| 2:30:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9047)|
| 2:30:48| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9048)|
| 2:30:49| So what you're recommending or what you're saying is that we need to vote it up or down today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9049)|
| 2:30:54| That certainly would be our preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9054)|
| 2:30:56| The only thing I would add to that is 30 days, although we can get an appraisal within that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9056)|
| 2:31:02| a lot of the other, I think, due diligence items, geotech, environmental review, the planning, cost estimates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9062)|
| 2:31:11| detailed cost estimates, those things cannot be accomplished in 30 or 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9071)|
| 2:31:15| And I just want to make sure the Commission is aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9075)|
| 2:31:22| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9082)|
| 2:31:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9083)|
| 2:31:24| I want to speak to go ahead and vote today on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9084)|
| 2:31:27| I mentioned that I was asked about a deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9087)|
| 2:31:30| I said I would think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9090)|
| 2:31:31| After thinking about it, I think most everybody has made up their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9091)|
| 2:31:33| And so I'd like to suggest that we go ahead and vote it up or vote it down today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9093)|
| 2:31:41| I just want to speak very briefly on a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9101)|
| 2:31:42| First of all, I know that there has been the mention of a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9102)|
| 2:31:45| I would just mention to you this is not about zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9105)|
| 2:31:48| This is not about the appropriateness of whether it is zoned properly or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9108)|
| 2:31:52| This is about the issuance of public funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9112)|
| 2:31:54| I find it very hard to believe that if we as a body do not feel that public funds are being spent in an appropriate manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9114)|
| 2:32:01| that there would be legal repercussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9121)|
| 2:32:04| But if that happens, that's why we have a law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9124)|
| 2:32:07| The other thing, too, is we've talked a lot, not a lot, but it has been mentioned about trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9127)|
| 2:32:12| And I have no problems with the individuals who are bringing this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9132)|
| 2:32:16| I think that they're doing exactly what we've asked them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9136)|
| 2:32:19| But Commissioner Norman also mentioned about the bumpy roads that we've had as a commission over the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9139)|
| 2:32:25| There's no question that we as a commission lost some of the trust of our constituents and the citizens in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9145)|
| 2:32:32| And I think that we have worked hard over the last two years to try to regain that trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9152)|
| 2:32:36| By voting on this today with 13-day notice does not, in my opinion, regain that trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9156)|
| 2:32:44| As a matter of fact, this pushes us in the other direction of doing something that is fast-tracked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9164)|
| 2:32:49| that hasn't been properly vetted, that we know that there are issues with the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9169)|
| 2:32:54| The gentleman has already said he wants us to vote it up or vote it down today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9174)|
| 2:32:58| I feel that if we are serious about the trust issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9178)|
| 2:33:02| not just the trust between us and our department heads, but our trust between us and our constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9182)|
| 2:33:07| that we need to go ahead and send a message that we're not going to be supportive of this type of process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9187)|
| 2:33:14| We're not going to be supportive of finding out about it on November the 3rd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9194)|
| 2:33:18| and being asked to vote on it on November the 16th, $500,000 of taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9198)|
| 2:33:23| I think we need to send that message loud and clear that we want to be involved in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9203)|
| 2:33:27| The citizens want to be involved in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9207)|
| 2:33:29| Commission wants to be involved in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9209)|
| 2:33:31| I can think of no better way of doing that than to vote this down today and say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9211)|
| 2:33:36| And with that, I'll call for the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9216)|
| 2:33:46| Commissioner Lambert, you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9226)|
| 2:33:50| Well, actually, we're on a new segment, but I'll just take two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9230)|
| 2:33:54| I agree with everything Mr. Hammond has said today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9234)|
| 2:33:58| And I'm going to call for the question both on the 30-day deferral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9238)|
| 2:34:03| and on the original motion after it fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9243)|
| 2:34:07| And I believe that we need to send that strong message today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9247)|
| 2:34:11| We don't like the way you did this, and so let's go ahead and let's deny the 30-day deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9251)|
| 2:34:18| When it goes back to the original question, let's shoot it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9258)|
| 2:34:21| Let's do it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9261)|
| 2:34:23| Let's do it now so that these folks can make it home in time for dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9263)|
| 2:34:34| Mr. Chair, we have a couple of lights on, and I didn't hear a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9274)|
| 2:34:40| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9280)|
| 2:34:43| I get confused so easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9283)|
| 2:34:44| I just heard an objection to the 13-days notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9284)|
| 2:34:48| and then using that as a reason not to have a 30-day delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9288)|
| 2:34:51| It seems to me an internally self-contradictory argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9291)|
| 2:34:55| And we're getting a lot of those these days because I think we're trying to push toward a predetermined conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9295)|
| 2:35:00| So I hope that we, if we really say we have problems with that short notice, then give ourselves the 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9300)|
| 2:35:09| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9309)|
| 2:35:11| Yes, all I would like to say, they have a 14-month option on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9311)|
| 2:35:16| According to Mr. Lawler, people have come out of the woodwork since they found out about this wanting to sell property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9316)|
| 2:35:22| And if it does vote for the delay, which I'm going to vote against the thing altogether because I'm against the plan right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9322)|
| 2:35:31| we should have an amendment in there that they have to look at this mixed-fadding property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9331)|
| 2:35:36| where it's property is already built and everything ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9336)|
| 2:35:40| And I just don't think they did a good job marketing this or people wouldn't be calling up now and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9340)|
| 2:35:45| Hey, I've got property and you've got, you know, and all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9345)|
| 2:35:48| So I think they've done a very poor job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9348)|
| 2:35:56| Commissioner Luto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9356)|
| 2:35:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9358)|
| 2:36:00| I've heard the gentleman with Southeastern Development say that he was against the delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9360)|
| 2:36:07| He would rather have the vote up or down today because he doesn't want to have to start committing real money on this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9367)|
| 2:36:14| without knowing for sure it's going to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9374)|
| 2:36:18| I'm against the delay because it sounds like the reaction of the folks in the audience would like to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9378)|
| 2:36:24| and have this taken care of today as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9384)|
| 2:36:26| But we do have a few people out here in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9386)|
| 2:36:28| I do know that they would like to speak on this matter and I'd like to give them that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9388)|
| 2:36:35| Well, I have four people's names, so I will get to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9395)|
| 2:36:42| Commissioner, any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9402)|
| 2:36:45| Billy Bates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9405)|
| 2:36:48| I had a call for the question, didn't I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9408)|
| 2:36:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9410)|
| 2:36:51| Say what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9411)|
| 2:36:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9412)|
| 2:36:54| Second to what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9414)|
| 2:36:56| I don't think we have any more lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9416)|
| 2:36:58| We have to give the public an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9418)|
| 2:37:00| I'm going with the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9420)|
| 2:37:05| Beth Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9425)|
| 2:37:11| Just need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9431)|
| 2:37:13| Beth Booker, 124 East Scott Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9433)|
| 2:37:21| I've been excited to hear that this is not about east, west, north, south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9441)|
| 2:37:25| As a resident of Knoxville for about 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9445)|
| 2:37:27| I've lived in the downtown and north Knoxville area for all that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9447)|
| 2:37:30| and as you know, we've got Menville and our share of public housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9450)|
| 2:37:33| so I'm really excited to hear that it's not about east, south, north, west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9453)|
| 2:37:37| It's very exciting to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9457)|
| 2:37:39| I would say, having listened to a little over two hours, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9459)|
| 2:37:43| an hour and a half of discussion on this, that I'm heartened by some of what you have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9463)|
| 2:37:47| and I hope that I'm hearing it in the spirit in which it was truly offered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9467)|
| 2:37:54| that of wanting to do the best things with my tax dollars, which are limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9474)|
| 2:37:59| At this point, I would like to just say that I would speak in favor of a 30-day extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9479)|
| 2:38:05| for more discussion, so the folks that we asked to do the best they could for us with the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9485)|
| 2:38:13| so that we could have time to consider that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9493)|
| 2:38:16| and make the best decision available for all the areas of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9496)|
| 2:38:21| I heard that in Finbar Saunders' invocation, let us do the best for all of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9501)|
| 2:38:28| and that was such a stirring message to me, Commissioner Saunders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9508)|
| 2:38:33| because that's what you're here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9513)|
| 2:38:35| That's what I watch for as I vote, as I consider those of you who will be running countywide in the near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9515)|
| 2:38:42| and I hope and pray that we're doing the best things for all of our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9522)|
| 2:38:47| because there but for the grace of God go I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9527)|
| 2:38:50| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9530)|
| 2:38:51| Have a good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9531)|
| 2:38:54| Virginia Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9534)|
| 2:39:08| Virginia Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9548)|
| 2:39:09| I live at 918 Gratz Street, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9549)|
| 2:39:14| I would also ask for a 30-day wait on this, and let us work through some of the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9554)|
| 2:39:23| The thing is, if we're going to do this, we have to use scattered site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9563)|
| 2:39:32| and that does not mean putting them all in north Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9572)|
| 2:39:37| If we're going to do scattered site, then let us look at that and not be so involved in this, not in my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9577)|
| 2:39:47| I've got a whole lot of it in my backyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9587)|
| 2:39:50| and it needs to be all over town to make these people welcome all over town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9590)|
| 2:39:57| to let them be happy and secure and lead a decent, fruitful life all over town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9597)|
| 2:40:04| and that includes all of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9604)|
| 2:40:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9607)|
| 2:40:12| Lauren Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9612)|
| 2:40:20| I'm Lauren Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9620)|
| 2:40:21| I'm from 229 East Sky Avenue in north Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9621)|
| 2:40:24| I speak on behalf of my household, which includes Dr. Stephen Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9624)|
| 2:40:28| I had the privilege of listening to all of you who will be running some of you for citywide offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9628)|
| 2:40:32| and other offices throughout the state in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9632)|
| 2:40:35| So, a great privilege today to listen to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9635)|
| 2:40:39| I just want to point out to everyone, and also in the audience and listening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9639)|
| 2:40:43| the 10-year plan is about six years, I believe, into 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9643)|
| 2:40:46| It was come up underneath the Bush administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9646)|
| 2:40:50| and it's interesting to me how the website has changed in recent times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9650)|
| 2:40:57| Starting with some of my notes here, Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9657)|
| 2:41:00| I used to be on the CAT Community Advisory Committee when this child was born.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9660)|
| 2:41:04| I stepped off, but I saw you speak there to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9664)|
| 2:41:08| We're just an advisory committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9668)|
| 2:41:10| We're not the ones who make the rules and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9670)|
| 2:41:12| but I remember you coming in and offering a week of your salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9672)|
| 2:41:14| to make sure some of these far-out county routes didn't get canceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9674)|
| 2:41:18| I can't speak for CAT Trans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9678)|
| 2:41:21| but I can say that extending a route is far more fiscally appropriate than adding new lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9681)|
| 2:41:26| So, when you're considering any properties for the scattered site approach in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9686)|
| 2:41:31| please don't consider chaining zoning on a property that is nowhere near a trans line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9691)|
| 2:41:35| because we really can't afford that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9695)|
| 2:41:37| I can certainly say that because we were fighting for the transportation lines we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9697)|
| 2:41:41| I think it's completely feasible to extend a line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9701)|
| 2:41:44| and I agree with Commissioner McKenzie here that we shouldn't decry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9704)|
| 2:41:49| that a certain area of town shouldn't have it, don't have it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9709)|
| 2:41:52| and we should support that and extend our transit lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9712)|
| 2:41:58| I've heard repeatedly, I went to the meeting last Thursday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9718)|
| 2:42:01| paid for a babysitter who lives on Wakefield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9721)|
| 2:42:03| who is right near this property that's being considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9723)|
| 2:42:05| who didn't know anything about it and didn't have a problem with it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9725)|
| 2:42:08| Her husband works for a UT police officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9728)|
| 2:42:12| has a great deal of intervention with homeless people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9732)|
| 2:42:16| which take up a lot of our tax dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9736)|
| 2:42:19| because we aren't doing a good job getting them off of the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9739)|
| 2:42:23| and dealing with their chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9743)|
| 2:42:25| A lot of that falls on the issue of health care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9745)|
| 2:42:28| but that's not our bag of issues here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9748)|
| 2:42:32| But I loud and clear heard that we're asking to pay lesser of the appraised value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9752)|
| 2:42:37| not $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9757)|
| 2:42:39| So, for you to beat that in the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9759)|
| 2:42:41| for anybody who wants to beat that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9761)|
| 2:42:43| that's not what they're asking to pay for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9763)|
| 2:42:46| This property is within a reasonable distance of extending a bus line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9766)|
| 2:42:50| and I would support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9770)|
| 2:42:51| It's also within reach of jobs that these people would qualify for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9771)|
| 2:42:55| and be able to take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9775)|
| 2:42:57| which I know many people here are overqualified for some of those jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9777)|
| 2:43:01| We certainly can't locate all the people who would take these jobs so far away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9781)|
| 2:43:05| Health care, we're not trying to tie any scattered housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9785)|
| 2:43:09| or past homeless housing to hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9789)|
| 2:43:14| Many hospitals don't even have psychiatric facilities within their confines anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9794)|
| 2:43:19| Most of these people will need outpatient care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9799)|
| 2:43:22| and their social worker that will be tied to these units will make sure of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9802)|
| 2:43:26| Zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9806)|
| 2:43:27| I do not support spot changing of zoning to accommodate a political issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9807)|
| 2:43:31| As we can see in some of our older districts of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9811)|
| 2:43:34| that has created problems by changing zoning, which affects housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9814)|
| 2:43:37| That's in my area of town over 100 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9817)|
| 2:43:41| Apartments near daycares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9821)|
| 2:43:43| There are apartments near the daycare my child is at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9823)|
| 2:43:45| which a lot of people in Sequoia Hills are also in that daycare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9825)|
| 2:43:48| as well as CCK, which is another common daycare, larger daycare in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9828)|
| 2:43:53| There are large clusters of apartments, and I have no idea who lives in those apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9833)|
| 2:43:57| They may be Section 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9837)|
| 2:43:59| I didn't go interview and see if those people were appropriate to be around my child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9839)|
| 2:44:02| but I also don't feel my child is in danger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9842)|
| 2:44:04| so I don't see any reason why 23 apartments can't be located near a daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9844)|
| 2:44:09| And let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9849)|
| 2:44:10| So I pretty much support 30 days to look at this, but also, you know, if you pass on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9850)|
| 2:44:16| there's certainly enough people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9856)|
| 2:44:17| Maybe you could pool your funds to put in a nice daycare on that tract of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9857)|
| 2:44:21| if you want to keep these people from buying it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9861)|
| 2:44:23| or maybe you could turn the alleged cave into Ruby Falls, another tourist attraction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9863)|
| 2:44:29| if you think it's inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9869)|
| 2:44:31| You know, I've heard talk of people at this meeting saying that it's inappropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9871)|
| 2:44:36| to locate formerly homeless people near children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9876)|
| 2:44:40| I live not too far from some of the missions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9880)|
| 2:44:43| and I commend you, Commissioner Lambert, for saying things like we shouldn't be fast-tracked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9883)|
| 2:44:48| because we were fast-tracked into MinnVilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9888)|
| 2:44:50| We were told that some of that money had to be voted on that very night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9890)|
| 2:44:54| or it would be lost and sent back to the federal government if it wasn't spent on MinnVilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9894)|
| 2:44:57| So I promise you we were fast-tracked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9897)|
| 2:44:59| So I think that's commendable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9899)|
| 2:45:01| And I didn't support that one either, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9901)|
| 2:45:02| I think that was a horrible way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9902)|
| 2:45:04| Despite that, I'll call you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9904)|
| 2:45:06| Out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9906)|
| 2:45:07| Commissioner Lambert's out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9907)|
| 2:45:12| Anyway, there was one more thing I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9912)|
| 2:45:16| Oh, and I also commend you on being so fiscally responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9916)|
| 2:45:20| You guys voted, I believe it was $250,000 toward the MinnVilla project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9920)|
| 2:45:24| which spikes its cost up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9924)|
| 2:45:26| You supported that, costing far more than this project had to busk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9926)|
| 2:45:30| So I'm glad that you've now been concerned about spending the tax dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9930)|
| 2:45:33| when that wasn't what you were discussing on that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9933)|
| 2:45:36| So thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9936)|
| 2:45:38| I support 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9938)|
| 2:45:39| I don't think you should take in vain that these people have legitimately considered many properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9939)|
| 2:45:44| But I think obviously what we found out of this is by the short term of public outcry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9944)|
| 2:45:49| you guys have found a lot of other potential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9949)|
| 2:45:52| So maybe we'll find something better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9952)|
| 2:45:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9954)|
| 2:45:57| I don't have any other names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9957)|
| 2:46:01| I think Mr. Mitchell wants to speak, and this gentleman, and this gentleman as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9961)|
| 2:46:05| I see the hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9965)|
| 2:46:07| How many people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9967)|
