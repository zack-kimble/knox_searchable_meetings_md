| 2:07:50| I did not, John. I have read on the 9th Circuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7670)|
| 2:07:54| But you can actually watch the whole video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7674)|
| 2:07:56| I guess your e-mail, was the e-mail in your presentation correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7676)|
| 2:08:00| It should have been, and I did not see anything from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7680)|
| 2:08:02| However, I have watched the 9th Circuit presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| and it deals with very unique situations like during the time the Rose Parade is going to be set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7684)|
| 2:08:11| can they be installing 5G antenna along the Rose Parade routes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7691)|
| 2:08:15| Those aren't my issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7695)|
| 2:08:16| My issues are my front yard in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7696)|
| 2:08:19| But it's in the federal courts now, which is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7699)|
| 2:08:22| It is in the federal courts, and we need to do anything we can do to buy time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7702)|
| 2:08:26| Our current situation is we need House Bill 2279 revised and replaced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7706)|
| 2:08:31| with defense of Tennessee citizens' individual properties and neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7711)|
| 2:08:35| and that's the power that you all have, is to come alongside us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7715)|
| 2:08:38| and help us get modification to that legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7718)|
| 2:08:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7722)|
| 2:08:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7723)|
| 2:08:44| I believe that's our last person who we've approached to sign up to speak at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7724)|
| 2:08:50| So, Madam Clerk, I think that gets us through the agenda for the first part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7730)|
| 2:08:53| so we're going to take a 10-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7733)|
| 2:08:55| I apologize to all the folks who are here for land use matters, but that was important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7735)|
| 2:09:00| We wanted to get through everything, and we'll take a quick 10-minute break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7740)|
| 2:09:04| and we'll begin the land use part of our meeting in about 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7744)|
| 2:09:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-business?start=7748)|
