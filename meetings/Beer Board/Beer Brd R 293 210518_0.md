| 0:20:24| How's that coming along?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210518?start=1224)|

| 0:20:33| In April TDOT did get with Knoxville and did get everything resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210518?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| Door, we have to do some minimal painting, uh, where our entrance is as opposed to having to block the whole thing off and demo the front of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210518?start=1237)|
| 0:20:44| Uh, so that was good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210518?start=1244)|

| 0:20:52| Uh, when I checked on it before I came in here today, we were waiting for the city building office to actually upload that to the, uh, the server, I guess, so that our GC can get ahold of it and that we can begin our build out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210518?start=1252)|
| 0:21:05| So, uh, so we were unfortunately still asking for some more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210518?start=1265)|
