| 2:24:43| And I'm here to speak to you to encourage you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8683)|
| 2:24:45| to hold off on adopting this salary schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8685)|
| 2:24:52| Since Tuesday, well, actually just Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8692)|
| 2:24:56| I took some time and studied part of the recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8696)|
| 2:24:59| the recommendation for teacher salary schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8699)|
| 2:25:04| And I sent you all an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8704)|
| 2:25:06| I don't know whether you've had a chance to see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8706)|
| 2:25:08| but it shows that over the course of 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8708)|
| 2:25:11| a teacher who started out getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8711)|
| 2:25:14| the same amount of money as an administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8714)|
| 2:25:16| or some other staff person who is not a teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8716)|
| 2:25:20| would end up making $20,000 less than if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8720)|
| 2:25:24| had been a non-teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8724)|
| 2:25:26| The salary schedule, the structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8726)|
| 2:25:28| that this program lays out has retention bumps, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8728)|
| 2:25:32| but it pays for the retention bumps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8732)|
| 2:25:35| are actually underpay teachers, make their raises lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8735)|
| 2:25:40| one, two, three, four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8740)|
| 2:25:42| And in the 50 years, you boost it up to the same place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8742)|
| 2:25:45| it would be if there was a linear thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8745)|
| 2:25:48| What it really does is it takes $1,000 increase a year out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8748)|
| 2:25:54| of teachers on average and puts $1,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8754)|
| 2:25:58| and saves $1,000 for the district for each teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8758)|
| 2:26:00| Now, if you want to tell the teachers how much we value you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8760)|
| 2:26:04| this is not the way to do it, because when they figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8764)|
| 2:26:07| that they're actually getting lower raises than people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8767)|
| 2:26:10| are not teachers in the system, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8770)|
| 2:26:13| going to say, well, wait a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8773)|
| 2:26:15| you guys don't care value us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8775)|
| 2:26:17| So that's something to be concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8777)|
| 2:26:22| but you've had two days to look at this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8782)|
| 2:26:25| and there are other things that we don't understand about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8785)|
| 2:26:29| They're talking about compression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8789)|
| 2:26:30| and how adjustments they're going to make to avoid salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8790)|
| 2:26:34| compression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8794)|
| 2:26:34| So now what exactly does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8794)|
| 2:26:36| Do you board members really understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8796)|
| 2:26:38| how they're going to do that, what that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8798)|
| 2:26:40| and who the beneficiaries and who the losers are in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8800)|
| 2:26:45| There's also talking about there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8805)|
| 2:26:46| people who are already being paid over market values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8806)|
| 2:26:50| What's going to be happening to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8810)|
| 2:26:53| My conversation with Mr. Bolton suggests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8813)|
| 2:26:55| that what they're going to do is they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8815)|
| 2:26:57| going to put them in a different salary schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8817)|
| 2:26:59| than the one they would naturally be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8819)|
| 2:27:01| And so it will look like their over market pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8821)|
| 2:27:06| will continue as long as they're with the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8826)|
| 2:27:10| My point is you don't really understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8830)|
| 2:27:12| what's in this salary schedule, and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8832)|
| 2:27:17| don't haven't had time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8837)|
| 2:27:18| You have the option of put this off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8838)|
| 2:27:21| actually understand what's in this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8841)|
| 2:27:24| and vote on it next time you meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8844)|
| 2:27:26| When is your next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8846)|
| 2:27:27| I guess it's the budget meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8847)|
| 2:27:30| But you don't really understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8850)|
| 2:27:31| and I don't think you should vote on it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8851)|
| 2:27:34| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8854)|
| 2:27:35| Madam Chair, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8855)|
| 2:27:39| Thank you, Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8859)|
| 2:27:40| All right, we'll move on to discussion of this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8860)|
| 2:27:44| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8864)|
| 2:27:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8866)|
| 2:27:48| First, I want to let the board know that I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8868)|
| 2:27:50| going to recuse myself from the vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8870)|
| 2:27:54| I don't necessarily have to, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8874)|
| 2:27:57| feel like I should because I have always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8877)|
| 2:27:59| said that when my time on the board ends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8879)|
| 2:28:03| I would want to go back to my classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8883)|
| 2:28:05| So I feel like, even though I'm not currently a teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8885)|
| 2:28:09| that I would be voting on my own salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8889)|
| 2:28:11| and I don't think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8891)|
| 2:28:13| So I will be recusing myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8893)|
| 2:28:16| That said, I share some concerns about the speed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8896)|
| 2:28:20| with which we are doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8900)|
| 2:28:22| I think it would behoove us to wait until closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8902)|
| 2:28:26| to the budget, even if we did it as a special called meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8906)|
| 2:28:32| right before our other special called meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8912)|
| 2:28:34| to talk about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8914)|
| 2:28:35| And part of the reason I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8915)|
| 2:28:38| is because it took me until today to even think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8918)|
| 2:28:42| I should probably recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8922)|
| 2:28:44| That didn't even strike me until today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8924)|
| 2:28:47| And that tells me right there that this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8927)|
| 2:28:49| being moved a little quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8929)|
| 2:28:52| I've had more phone calls and texts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8932)|
| 2:28:54| about this with really confused questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8934)|
| 2:28:58| than I've had about a lot of things in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8938)|
| 2:29:01| So I want to ask some of those questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8941)|
| 2:29:04| and just also really think about the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8944)|
| 2:29:07| that what we are approving is a salary scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8947)|
| 2:29:12| A salary scale for a public school district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8952)|
| 2:29:14| is supposed to be public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8954)|
| 2:29:18| And we have not, not only have board members not fully seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8958)|
| 2:29:24| every piece of the salary scale, the public absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8964)|
| 2:29:28| has not seen every piece of the salary scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8968)|
| 2:29:31| And that's why they're confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8971)|
| 2:29:33| If we were doing this in a really open and transparent way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8973)|
| 2:29:37| all of these pieces would have been laid out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8977)|
| 2:29:39| so that all of our employees understand exactly where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8979)|
| 2:29:43| they would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8983)|
| 2:29:44| When I looked up at the screen, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8984)|
| 2:29:46| When I looked up at the screen, I could see where I would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8986)|
| 2:29:49| I saw exactly what my pay would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8989)|
| 2:29:51| if I were in a classroom today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8991)|
| 2:29:54| If I were in some other positions in the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8994)|
| 2:29:57| I never got to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8997)|
| 2:29:59| I would have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=8999)|
| 2:30:00| If I am a custodian at step two, I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9000)|
| 2:30:05| been in the district two years, I can't look up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9005)|
| 2:30:08| and see where I'm going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9008)|
| 2:30:10| Not only can I not look up there and see where I can be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9010)|
| 2:30:13| there's nowhere I can look to see where I can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9013)|
| 2:30:17| Because that information is not available right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9017)|
| 2:30:20| to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9020)|
| 2:30:22| And it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9022)|
| 2:30:23| So that is my other reason that I think it should be put off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9023)|
| 2:30:27| and would encourage you to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9027)|
| 2:30:31| So my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9031)|
| 2:30:33| I think I know the answer to this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9033)|
| 2:30:36| but I want to be sure I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9036)|
| 2:30:37| Is there anything in this that impacts career ladder funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9037)|
| 2:30:41| at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9041)|
| 2:30:46| Madam Chair, Ms. Owen, I have a backup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9046)|
| 2:30:51| to correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9051)|
| 2:30:52| But I believe the answer to that would be no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9052)|
| 2:30:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9054)|
| 2:30:55| That was my assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9055)|
| 2:30:57| And so at some point, I heard something about career ladder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9057)|
| 2:31:01| Not during this, but career ladder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9061)|
| 2:31:03| is not ending anywhere, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9063)|
| 2:31:05| That we have ever heard of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9065)|
| 2:31:07| It's just rolling along fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9067)|
| 2:31:10| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9070)|
| 2:31:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9072)|
| 2:31:13| All right, so next is where do speech pathologists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9073)|
| 2:31:16| fall in the pay scale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9076)|
| 2:31:18| So Madam Chair, Ms. Owen, speech pathologists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9078)|
| 2:31:23| would not be on the teacher scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9083)|
| 2:31:27| They would be on the general scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9087)|
| 2:31:28| I do think that there was some confusion in the presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9088)|
| 2:31:34| we shared on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9094)|
| 2:31:36| Because the teacher plan, we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9096)|
| 2:31:39| labeled as the certified plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9099)|
| 2:31:41| So I think there was some confusion in who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9101)|
| 2:31:45| would be on the teacher scale versus the general scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9105)|
| 2:31:48| The general scale will have both certified and classified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9108)|
| 2:31:52| employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9112)|
| 2:31:53| And the SLPs would be on the general scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9113)|
| 2:31:56| on a grade band on the general scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9116)|
| 2:32:00| So I haven't looked deeply at the speech pathologist pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9120)|
| 2:32:05| scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9125)|
| 2:32:07| So is it possible that as time goes on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9127)|
| 2:32:11| that wherever they are now, they would pass the teacher pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9131)|
| 2:32:16| scale at some point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9136)|
| 2:32:20| Are their increases going to be greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9140)|
| 2:32:22| than teacher increases per year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9142)|
| 2:32:24| I think, Mr. Bolton, you want to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9144)|
| 2:32:26| So they would be, and I'll let Mr. Bolton come too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9146)|
| 2:32:30| they would be on a different scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9150)|
| 2:32:33| Also, the market value for SLPs was different than the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9153)|
| 2:32:39| value for teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9159)|
| 2:32:41| So they would have a different progression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9161)|
| 2:32:43| I'm not sure that I understand the question fully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9163)|
| 2:32:45| They would have a different progression,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9165)|
| 2:32:47| so a different step 0 and step 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9167)|
| 2:32:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9169)|
| 2:32:50| And they are having difficulty understanding the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9170)|
| 2:32:53| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9173)|
| 2:32:57| They are trying to look at what is involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9177)|
| 2:33:00| in their certifications to understand exactly how they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9180)|
| 2:33:05| could even begin to determine what their pay might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9185)|
| 2:33:09| And that's part of the issue of not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9189)|
| 2:33:10| having this put out transparently to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9190)|
| 2:33:14| is they could also look up there and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9194)|
| 2:33:16| what the teacher pay was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9196)|
| 2:33:17| But they can't look and see what their own pay is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9197)|
| 2:33:20| And so that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9200)|
| 2:33:23| Where do school nurses fall on this schedule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9203)|
| 2:33:26| And what they want to know is the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9206)|
| 2:33:30| where RNs would fall and where LPNs would fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9210)|
| 2:33:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9213)|
| 2:33:33| So RNs and LPNs will also be on the general scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9213)|
| 2:33:37| And I will say that each individual employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9217)|
| 2:33:41| will get a notification of grade band| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9221)|
| 2:33:44| and specific annual salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9224)|
| 2:33:47| So grade band that they'll be on step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9227)|
| 2:33:49| what that computes to annual salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9229)|
| 2:33:51| for our employees that are paid on the annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9231)|
| 2:33:54| As you'll notice on the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9234)|
| 2:33:58| what is on the general plan is hourly rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9238)|
| 2:34:01| That is what Evergreen based the study on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9241)|
| 2:34:04| comparing hourly rates across all of these employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9244)|
| 2:34:08| Because districts pay people in different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9248)|
| 2:34:12| We do also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9252)|
| 2:34:13| We have some people working eight hour days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9253)|
| 2:34:16| some people paid for 7.75 hours a day, some people on 7.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9256)|
| 2:34:20| So should the board approve the general scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9260)|
| 2:34:25| then for every category of employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9265)|
| 2:34:27| that will be converted to an annual salary for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9267)|
| 2:34:32| that are paid monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9272)|
| 2:34:33| And yes, you're correct, all of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9273)|
| 2:34:36| will be posted together on the website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9276)|
| 2:34:39| as the full salary scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9279)|
| 2:34:41| OK, so the school nurse who asked me this question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9281)|
| 2:34:45| said that she is currently paid on the teacher scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9285)|
| 2:34:48| And it was my understanding that that was a state requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9288)|
| 2:34:51| that we pay nurses on the teacher scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9291)|
| 2:34:54| So if we move them to the general scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9294)|
| 2:34:56| is that a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9296)|
| 2:34:58| So I may have to lean on Mr. Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9298)|
| 2:35:02| I believe there was legislation that moved through that did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9302)|
| 2:35:10| make it to TCA at the end of the session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9310)|
| 2:35:17| So the answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9317)|
| 2:35:18| Only teachers will be on the teacher scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9318)|
| 2:35:20| Everyone else will be on the general scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9320)|
| 2:35:23| But RNs will be slotted in on the general scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9323)|
| 2:35:26| at market value, and the same for LPNs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9326)|
| 2:35:32| Where would curriculum generalists be on the scale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9332)|
| 2:35:35| Would they be listed as teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9335)|
| 2:35:37| or would they be different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9337)|
| 2:35:41| Curriculum generalists, so the facilitators or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9341)|
| 2:35:50| Any of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9350)|
| 2:35:52| Instructional facilitators could be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9352)|
| 2:35:55| Right, instructional coaches, facilitators, general scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9355)|
| 2:36:00| So looking at the bumps, this may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9360)|
| 2:36:02| be a question for Mr. Bolton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9362)|
| 2:36:04| Looking at the bumps and using those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9364)|
| 2:36:09| as an incentive for retention, what kind of data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9369)|
| 2:36:14| was used to determine where those bumps should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9374)|
| 2:36:16| be for retention purposes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9376)|
| 2:36:22| Mr. Bolton may have more to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9382)|
| 2:36:23| Those would have been Evergreen's data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9383)|
| 2:36:27| that they used in their recommendation to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9387)|
| 2:36:29| That was part of the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9389)|
| 2:36:33| I don't know that I have specifics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9393)|
| 2:36:36| in what they considered in making that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9396)|
| 2:36:39| The reason I ask that specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9399)|
| 2:36:41| is because there was a time when five years was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9401)|
| 2:36:44| a place where there was a dip in teacher retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9404)|
| 2:36:49| But I believe that is now around three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9409)|
| 2:36:52| And so when I look at 5, 10, 15, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9412)|
| 2:36:55| not seeing something that aligns with where the actual dips are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9415)|
| 2:37:00| in teacher retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9420)|
| 2:37:02| So it concerns me that we are putting in something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9422)|
| 2:37:06| is purported to impact retention that doesn't align with what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9426)|
| 2:37:10| the data currently is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9430)|
| 2:37:13| Are there any supplements, or stipends, or anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9433)|
| 2:37:16| for a person who has additional endorsements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9436)|
| 2:37:23| So I would say generally the answer to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9443)|
| 2:37:27| would be no, with the caveat that Mr. Bolton shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9447)|
| 2:37:32| on Tuesday is that one of the recommendations from Evergreen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9452)|
| 2:37:37| also was to convene a board of trustees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9457)|
| 2:37:40| also was to convene a committee to develop payroll procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9460)|
| 2:37:45| So they didn't recommend what those were necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9465)|
| 2:37:48| but just recognized what we know is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9468)|
| 2:37:51| that our current payroll procedures are developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9471)|
| 2:37:53| around our current salary schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9473)|
| 2:37:55| So should we move to a new one, then the team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9475)|
| 2:37:58| needs to revisit all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9478)|
| 2:37:59| So I'll make that caveat that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9479)|
| 2:38:01| may be some recommendations that come from that team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9481)|
| 2:38:05| But if you mean additional, like if a teacher that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9485)|
| 2:38:12| is teaching one content area also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9492)|
| 2:38:14| has an endorsement in another content area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9494)|
| 2:38:17| then currently no, there would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9497)|
| 2:38:19| be additional compensation for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9499)|
| 2:38:21| My thinking is more of a teacher had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9501)|
| 2:38:24| an endorsement in a content area and went back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9504)|
| 2:38:27| and did additional hours for a high needs content area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9507)|
| 2:38:32| so that they could teach in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9512)|
| 2:38:35| Right now, the salary schedule does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9515)|
| 2:38:41| consider additional compensation for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9521)|
| 2:38:43| but we do still have our strategic compensation model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9523)|
| 2:38:46| So if a teacher was not in a high need area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9526)|
| 2:38:50| that received a signing bonus and moved into one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9530)|
| 2:38:53| then they could receive that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9533)|
| 2:38:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9534)|
| 2:38:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9535)|
| 2:39:02| Looking at supplements for department chairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9542)|
| 2:39:07| I assume that would be the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9547)|
| 2:39:12| Department chairs would receive a supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9552)|
| 2:39:15| So that is one of the things that will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9555)|
| 2:39:17| be the same next year as it is currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9557)|
| 2:39:20| under the ESSER funded department chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9560)|
| 2:39:25| And will there be a separate schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9565)|
| 2:39:27| for coaching supplements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9567)|
| 2:39:30| Yeah, we do not anticipate changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9570)|
| 2:39:32| to the athletic coaching supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9572)|
| 2:39:34| So we anticipate that remains largely the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9574)|
| 2:39:38| Evergreen did not make recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9578)|
| 2:39:39| on the coaching supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9579)|
| 2:39:42| Primarily, as they shared, they vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9582)|
| 2:39:45| So there isn't a market value necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9585)|
| 2:39:48| because coaching supplements vary so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9588)|
| 2:39:50| from district to district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9590)|
| 2:39:51| So are we talking about that whole page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9591)|
| 2:39:53| of supplements that included some administrators, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9593)|
| 2:39:59| on that supplement scale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9599)|
| 2:40:01| Or are we just talking about the lower portion of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9601)|
| 2:40:05| I can't see it in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9605)|
| 2:40:06| We're just talking about athletic coaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9606)|
| 2:40:08| There would be no administrative supplements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9608)|
| 2:40:10| What about the supplement for head band directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9610)|
| 2:40:15| and middle school band directors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9615)|
| 2:40:17| I believe Mr. Bolton can correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9617)|
| 2:40:20| I believe those would remain lead teacher supplements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9620)|
| 2:40:22| So if it's outside the scope of the position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9622)|
| 2:40:27| that they were hired for, so the extra duties like department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9627)|
| 2:40:31| chair, lead teacher, those supplements would remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9631)|
| 2:40:35| So the bottom part of the, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9635)|
| 2:40:39| So I would encourage board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9639)|
| 2:40:40| to look at what Mr. McCold talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9640)|
| 2:40:48| It's really hard to look at the numbers up there, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9648)|
| 2:40:53| are significantly higher, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9653)|
| 2:40:57| consider that there's a loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9657)|
| 2:41:00| But the same way that we came back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9660)|
| 2:41:03| and talked about the reasons for not stretching out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9663)|
| 2:41:07| our salary scale to more years so that teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9667)|
| 2:41:11| could get that money earlier, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9671)|
| 2:41:14| doing the opposite with the bumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9674)|
| 2:41:17| Because instead of spreading them out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9677)|
| 2:41:19| so that each increase is the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9679)|
| 2:41:23| we hold on to some of the money, and hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9683)|
| 2:41:25| on to some of the money, and hold on to some of the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9685)|
| 2:41:28| And then in the fifth year, we equalize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9688)|
| 2:41:32| And then over the next five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9692)|
| 2:41:33| we hold on to some of the money, and hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9693)|
| 2:41:35| on to some of the money, and hold on to some of the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9695)|
| 2:41:38| And then we equalize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9698)|
| 2:41:39| So more than an incentive to keep people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9699)|
| 2:41:46| what we're really doing is paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9706)|
| 2:41:52| for some of the plan that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9712)|
| 2:41:55| And I think we need to be really transparent about how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9715)|
| 2:41:57| that's working so that people understand that, yes, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9717)|
| 2:42:06| is significantly better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9726)|
| 2:42:07| We can't really argue against raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9727)|
| 2:42:09| That's hard to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9729)|
| 2:42:11| But I think it's something that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9731)|
| 2:42:13| need to look at in the future so that we don't forget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9733)|
| 2:42:20| that there is that piece that could make a really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9740)|
| 2:42:25| big difference if we did it equally across all the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9745)|
| 2:42:30| instead of holding back and then bumping up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9750)|
| 2:42:33| So I would encourage us to really keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9753)|
| 2:42:39| all of these pieces in mind and to bring them back so that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9759)|
| 2:42:44| can make adjustments to them over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9764)|
| 2:42:48| and that we don't get really committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9768)|
| 2:42:52| to this exact salary schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9772)|
| 2:42:55| Because I think there are a lot of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9775)|
| 2:42:57| here that have not been anticipated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9777)|
| 2:43:00| and have not been seen that we are going to want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9780)|
| 2:43:03| to really dig into later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9783)|
| 2:43:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9784)|
| 2:43:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9786)|
| 2:43:06| I've got a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9786)|
| 2:43:07| So this looks like we're voting on these four pages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9787)|
| 2:43:09| essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9789)|
| 2:43:10| And I know that it's been mentioned before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9790)|
| 2:43:12| but is there any guarantee that none of our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9792)|
| 2:43:16| or employees or anything will be decreased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9796)|
| 2:43:20| in pay or salary or compensation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9800)|
| 2:43:22| And I know that we're voting on these four pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9802)|
| 2:43:25| But is there any guarantee that none of our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9805)|
| 2:43:28| or employees or anything will be decreased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9808)|
| 2:43:32| in pay or salary or compensation, whatnot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9812)|
| 2:43:38| Madam Chair, Ms. Spike, no one is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9818)|
| 2:43:40| moving backwards as a result of the salary study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9820)|
| 2:43:42| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9822)|
| 2:43:43| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9823)|
| 2:43:47| And then what are the implications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9827)|
| 2:43:49| in not passing this tonight and instead passing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9829)|
| 2:43:54| in our budget meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9834)|
| 2:43:59| Madam Chair, Ms. Spike, that's, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9839)|
| 2:44:01| what we will do is carry out the will of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9841)|
| 2:44:07| What delaying may do is impact the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9847)|
| 2:44:14| to be ready if this were to be implemented on July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9854)|
| 2:44:20| So that's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9860)|
| 2:44:21| And then two, at the special called meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9861)|
| 2:44:26| where there is the vote on the proposed budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9866)|
| 2:44:30| if there were changes at that meeting proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9870)|
| 2:44:34| then that would require some on-the-spot recalculation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9874)|
| 2:44:39| of the proposed budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9879)|
| 2:44:41| So those are two that I can think of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9881)|
| 2:44:45| But of course, we will carry out the will of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9885)|
| 2:44:50| My next question is that on the fourth page at the very bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9890)|
| 2:44:55| where it says KCS may value recognized certifications given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9895)|
| 2:45:00| may is kind of like a very optional word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9900)|
| 2:45:03| Is there a possibility of changing that of will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9903)|
| 2:45:07| or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9907)|
| 2:45:10| Because I do think, like Ms. Owen mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9910)|
| 2:45:15| that there are many people that have put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9915)|
| 2:45:17| a lot into their qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9917)|
| 2:45:19| And they really want to know that they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9919)|
| 2:45:21| to be compensated fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9921)|
| 2:45:24| So yes, like Mr. Bolton explained on Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9924)|
| 2:45:30| once the committee that Evergreen has recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9930)|
| 2:45:33| that we convene, once they develop those payroll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9933)|
| 2:45:36| procedures, they will be published on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9936)|
| 2:45:40| Ms. Owen also pointed out, made a good point on Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9940)|
| 2:45:44| that should we associate those certifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9944)|
| 2:45:46| or the degrees with the position that the person's performing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9946)|
| 2:45:50| So that may be something that comes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9950)|
| 2:45:51| of the payroll committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9951)|
| 2:45:53| I would be hesitant to change that to will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9953)|
| 2:45:56| without considering what type of certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9956)|
| 2:45:58| and what type of position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9958)|
| 2:46:03| Is there a way to say that any current one that is already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9963)|
| 2:46:08| being compensated in an extra way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9968)|
| 2:46:11| will continue to be compensated, like having that in writing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9971)|
| 2:46:15| So that's a tough one to answer on the spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9975)|
| 2:46:20| without considering all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9980)|
| 2:46:22| Because some of the qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9982)|
| 2:46:29| were considered by Evergreen in making the determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9989)|
| 2:46:33| of market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9993)|
| 2:46:36| So I would be hesitant to say that that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9996)|
| 2:46:39| something that we're going to have to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=9999)|
| 2:46:45| I would be hesitant to say everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10005)|
| 2:46:48| So for example, this isn't technically a certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10008)|
| 2:46:52| but the administrative supplement, that supplement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10012)|
| 2:46:56| scale is going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10016)|
| 2:46:58| The dollars that are there for the employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10018)|
| 2:47:02| are not going away, but they will just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10022)|
| 2:47:04| be paid on one scale versus a base and a supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10024)|
| 2:47:07| So with little things like that, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10027)|
| 2:47:09| would be hesitant to put an absolute in without making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10029)|
| 2:47:14| that we've considered everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10034)|
| 2:47:17| And my next last question, to just really understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10037)|
| 2:47:23| what exactly we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10043)|
| 2:47:24| We're voting on these four pages, essentially three pages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10044)|
| 2:47:28| that have our teacher salary schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10048)|
| 2:47:33| and then the hourly rates that are grade bands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10053)|
| 2:47:37| and then this extra educational certification stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10057)|
| 2:47:44| So if we're voting on that, is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10064)|
| 2:47:47| and I apologize if I've forgotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10067)|
| 2:47:49| and you've already said this and you're repeating yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10069)|
| 2:47:51| It's been a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10071)|
| 2:47:54| That when you go through and start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10074)|
| 2:47:56| to look at where everyone is placed within this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10076)|
| 2:48:00| are you getting teacher input?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10080)|
| 2:48:03| What is the group that's making that decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10083)|
| 2:48:06| Evergreen Solutions is the group that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10086)|
| 2:48:09| built the classification rubric to place people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10089)|
| 2:48:14| at market value on the scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10094)|
| 2:48:16| So we are using the recommendations from Evergreen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10096)|
| 2:48:23| So are there any times where groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10103)|
| 2:48:26| of teachers or administrators or anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10106)|
| 2:48:29| are having any sort of input in this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10109)|
| 2:48:34| So yes, in the compensation and classification study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10114)|
| 2:48:38| Evergreen released a job assessment tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10118)|
| 2:48:42| released an employee survey, and did focus groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10122)|
| 2:48:45| with our employees as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10125)|
| 2:48:47| But not necessarily like after we vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10127)|
| 2:48:49| So when we vote on this, this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10129)|
| 2:48:52| you kind of already know where everyone's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10132)|
| 2:48:54| going to be at based on what Evergreen has recommended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10134)|
| 2:48:57| But mostly, currently, we already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10137)|
| 2:48:59| know where everyone will fall, the range everyone will fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10139)|
| 2:49:02| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10142)|
| 2:49:03| We will provide individual notifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10143)|
| 2:49:07| to all employees, and that notification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10147)|
| 2:49:10| will also give them a path to ask for clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10150)|
| 2:49:15| to ask any questions they may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10155)|
| 2:49:18| But no, the employee input was input on the job duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10158)|
| 2:49:24| The functions they perform every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10164)|
| 2:49:25| is the job description that we provided Evergreen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10165)|
| 2:49:29| encompassing of the duties that they perform every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10169)|
| 2:49:31| And Evergreen used that for comparison for market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10171)|
| 2:49:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10177)|
| 2:49:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10178)|
| 2:49:41| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10181)|
| 2:49:42| Just a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10182)|
| 2:49:44| One, just to hear for clarity, Jennifer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10184)|
| 2:49:47| are you recommending we vote no tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10187)|
| 2:49:49| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10189)|
| 2:49:51| I know you had a bunch of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10191)|
| 2:49:52| Seemed really concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10192)|
| 2:49:53| I just wanted to get clarity on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10193)|
| 2:49:55| No, I thought I was clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10195)|
| 2:49:56| I'm recommending that we take more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10196)|
| 2:50:00| And then, Ms. Hancock, I know we had to cut you off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10200)|
| 2:50:02| You only had three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10202)|
| 2:50:05| KCA supports this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10205)|
| 2:50:06| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10206)|
| 2:50:08| In accordance that I know, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10208)|
| 2:50:12| I didn't get a chance to say it to the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10212)|
| 2:50:14| but in accordance to the Collaborative Conferencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10214)|
| 2:50:16| Act, the Knox County Education Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10216)|
| 2:50:21| with the management team of the board for collaborative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10221)|
| 2:50:26| conferencing, we did get consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10226)|
| 2:50:30| for this to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10230)|
| 2:50:31| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10231)|
| 2:50:32| For me, thank you, Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10232)|
| 2:50:34| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10234)|
| 2:50:35| There are a few things that are easier yeses for me than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10235)|
| 2:50:39| I don't know what else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10239)|
| 2:50:40| Maybe the playgrounds for children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10240)|
| 2:50:41| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10241)|
| 2:50:42| That was an easy yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10242)|
| 2:50:43| That's always a good move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10243)|
| 2:50:44| But I mean, you know, Mr. Bolton, Ms. Hemingarn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10244)|
| 2:50:48| I know you put a lot of work into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10248)|
| 2:50:50| And when we vote yes tonight, you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10250)|
| 2:50:52| have a lot of work to get all this information out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10252)|
| 2:50:54| get it all figured out by July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10254)|
| 2:50:55| So your work is, in some ways, just beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10255)|
| 2:50:58| And so I appreciate all the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10258)|
| 2:50:59| I think Knox County's done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10259)|
| 2:51:01| Mr. McPherson and others making the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10261)|
| 2:51:03| to pay down some debt ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10263)|
| 2:51:05| I had my budget meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10265)|
| 2:51:07| And so the work they've done to save money in other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10267)|
| 2:51:10| to be able to absorb this whole lump sum is pretty impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10270)|
| 2:51:15| They put that kind of work in and figured out a way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10275)|
| 2:51:18| frankly, to find $40 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10278)|
| 2:51:20| It's just an incredible, that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10280)|
| 2:51:23| something you get out of your couch cushions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10283)|
| 2:51:25| So I appreciate the work that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10285)|
| 2:51:27| have done to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10287)|
| 2:51:29| And so, I mean, frankly, to be honest with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10289)|
| 2:51:31| there really are a few things that are easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10291)|
| 2:51:34| yeses than raises for teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10294)|
| 2:51:37| We have gone through Evergreen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10297)|
| 2:51:38| And they have said the market value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10298)|
| 2:51:40| it is their recommendation based on market value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10300)|
| 2:51:42| that we do the steps the way we do them with the extra bump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10302)|
| 2:51:45| in the fifth year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10305)|
| 2:51:46| So that is not taking money out of their pocket in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10306)|
| 2:51:49| That is just a fair market value that they recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10309)|
| 2:51:52| Nobody's getting a deduction in pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10312)|
| 2:51:56| The vast majority are getting an increase in pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10316)|
| 2:51:58| Some of them an incredibly significant amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10318)|
| 2:52:00| I have heard from several principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10320)|
| 2:52:02| how thrilled they are at the pay increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10322)|
| 2:52:04| that their secretaries will get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10324)|
| 2:52:06| They hold it all together in a lot of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10326)|
| 2:52:09| And so I've heard just so many overwhelming positive comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10329)|
| 2:52:13| Even the questions that have been asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10333)|
| 2:52:14| I felt very comfortable answering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10334)|
| 2:52:16| So to be honest with you, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10336)|
| 2:52:19| it would be, in many ways, disrespectful of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10339)|
| 2:52:22| to our teachers to vote no on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10342)|
| 2:52:25| I think it's an absolute yes, and allow Mr. Bolton, his team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10345)|
| 2:52:29| and Jennifer to get to work on figuring out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10349)|
| 2:52:31| how they're going to implement all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10351)|
| 2:52:33| and get all that information out to teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10353)|
| 2:52:36| So that's my opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10356)|
| 2:52:40| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10360)|
| 2:52:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10362)|
| 2:52:44| Thank you, Ms. Sumengar and Mr. Bolton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10364)|
| 2:52:46| You all have done a lot of work, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10366)|
| 2:52:48| know a lot of other people have as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10368)|
| 2:52:49| And I appreciated the time I had for a few minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10369)|
| 2:52:52| before this meeting, and the time at the budget meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10372)|
| 2:52:54| and also getting access to the whole report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10374)|
| 2:52:57| That was good reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10377)|
| 2:52:59| I mean, I was really, I thought it was good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10379)|
| 2:53:02| I thought it was a good work product,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10382)|
| 2:53:05| and appreciate the work that's gone into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10385)|
| 2:53:08| I want to make sure that I'm clear on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10388)|
| 2:53:10| What's driving a lot of Evergreen's recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10390)|
| 2:53:14| to us is alignment to market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10394)|
| 2:53:16| Is that fair to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10396)|
| 2:53:19| Madam Chair, Mr. Watson, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10399)|
| 2:53:20| There's a lot of other objectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10400)|
| 2:53:22| you could try to meet in a shift in the salary schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10402)|
| 2:53:27| And one of the approaches that you could take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10407)|
| 2:53:29| and I think this is where it gets real personal for people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10409)|
| 2:53:32| is you could try to say, well, how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10412)|
| 2:53:35| does this job align to this job in terms of value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10415)|
| 2:53:38| and compare people to one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10418)|
| 2:53:40| positions to one another, which is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10420)|
| 2:53:42| what this is doing, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10422)|
| 2:53:43| That's not the objective of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10423)|
| 2:53:46| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10426)|
| 2:53:46| That is not the objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10426)|
| 2:53:49| I believe that Evergreen would agree with our belief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10429)|
| 2:53:51| that every position in Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10431)|
| 2:53:54| is equally important to completing our mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10434)|
| 2:53:57| And some of those we are currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10437)|
| 2:54:00| paying closer to market value than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10440)|
| 2:54:03| Which is why at the end of this, no matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10443)|
| 2:54:06| if the objective was to get closer to market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10446)|
| 2:54:09| there will be some who are going to experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10449)|
| 2:54:11| more significant raises than others, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10451)|
| 2:54:14| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10454)|
| 2:54:15| And that's not an indication about how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10455)|
| 2:54:17| we value individual or separate positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10457)|
| 2:54:20| That's just saying, hey, the objective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10460)|
| 2:54:22| was to get closer to market, and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10462)|
| 2:54:24| is what market looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10464)|
| 2:54:25| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10465)|
| 2:54:25| That's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10465)|
| 2:54:26| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10466)|
| 2:54:27| So one technical thing that I think could be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10467)|
| 2:54:30| is on the document that we received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10470)|
| 2:54:33| the hourly rates by grade bands, that actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10473)|
| 2:54:36| is not labeled the general scale, which could be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10476)|
| 2:54:40| I don't think people necessarily know what that scale is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10480)|
| 2:54:42| if they just look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10482)|
| 2:54:44| Also, in that one, you have grades running 0 through 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10484)|
| 2:54:49| across the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10489)|
| 2:54:50| In the teacher one, you have grades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10490)|
| 2:54:52| running down as a column, which can also be confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10492)|
| 2:54:56| And actually, the rows, I don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10496)|
| 2:54:57| in the hourly rates by grade bands is actually labeled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10497)|
| 2:55:01| I don't know if the general public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10501)|
| 2:55:03| I know I don't know what 101, 102 means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10503)|
| 2:55:05| I know the end result of it is that's the classifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10505)|
| 2:55:09| and that's where you're going to put certain positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10509)|
| 2:55:11| But I think having a label on the rows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10511)|
| 2:55:13| could be helpful, because there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10513)|
| 2:55:15| nothing identifying what the 101 and 102 is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10515)|
| 2:55:18| Does that make sense, what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10518)|
| 2:55:20| I think that could be helpful, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10520)|
| 2:55:21| And so, to Ms. Owen's point, it is really easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10521)|
| 2:55:26| It's fairly easy right now for a teacher to look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10526)|
| 2:55:28| because they're the only people on that scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10528)|
| 2:55:30| And they can say, I can kind of work my way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10530)|
| 2:55:33| into figuring out about where I'm going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10533)|
| 2:55:35| But we have a whole host of employees that can't, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10535)|
| 2:55:39| And there's a decision that's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10539)|
| 2:55:42| made to, in the beginning, say, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10542)|
| 2:55:45| we're going to publish a draft of the teacher scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10545)|
| 2:55:49| Now, they're the only ones on it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10549)|
| 2:55:51| So it's kind of obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10551)|
| 2:55:53| But there's been an intention not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10553)|
| 2:55:55| to say where everybody else is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10555)|
| 2:55:57| And Ms. Simmer, you already mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10557)|
| 2:55:59| that you feel like you all have a pretty good idea where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10559)|
| 2:56:01| people are going to be different positions, not individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10561)|
| 2:56:05| based on that classification rubric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10565)|
| 2:56:08| Can you share why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10568)|
| 2:56:10| And I'm not asking this antagonistically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10570)|
| 2:56:12| There's an intentional decision that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10572)|
| 2:56:14| been made to not do that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10574)|
| 2:56:15| You could have chose to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10575)|
| 2:56:16| So can you take us through the thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10576)|
| 2:56:18| of why you didn't do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10578)|
| 2:56:19| Sure, Madam Chair, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10579)|
| 2:56:21| Yes, what we want to do is, we are very excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10581)|
| 2:56:27| We're excited about the impact that this will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10587)|
| 2:56:30| have on all of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10590)|
| 2:56:33| When we share the information, we want to be 100% accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10593)|
| 2:56:37| Evergreen has made recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10597)|
| 2:56:39| for placement of all categories of employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10599)|
| 2:56:44| Also, all specific employees in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10604)|
| 2:56:48| And so Mr. Bolton and his team are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10608)|
| 2:56:51| meeting with every department chair in the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10611)|
| 2:56:54| and going over all of those to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10614)|
| 2:56:56| that we haven't missed anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10616)|
| 2:56:59| To make sure that, for example, we discovered one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10619)|
| 2:57:04| where employees were reversed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10624)|
| 2:57:09| So just checking every single employee and employee category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10629)|
| 2:57:14| to make sure that they all line up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10634)|
| 2:57:16| before publishing the full list of employees and employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10636)|
| 2:57:20| amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10640)|
| 2:57:21| Is it fair to say, then, that you haven't made that known yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10641)|
| 2:57:24| because the last thing you want to do is retract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10644)|
| 2:57:26| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10646)|
| 2:57:27| You don't want to be like, oh my gosh, we goofed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10647)|
| 2:57:29| So sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10649)|
| 2:57:30| We thought you were going to get this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10650)|
| 2:57:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10651)|
| 2:57:32| And you're not, you know, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10652)|
| 2:57:34| I can get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10654)|
| 2:57:35| I mean, I get that from a process standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10655)|
| 2:57:38| I also get the desire of everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10658)|
| 2:57:40| who's watching this in Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10660)|
| 2:57:42| right now trying to, like, map themselves out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10662)|
| 2:57:43| and kind of figure out where they're going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10663)|
| 2:57:46| I totally get that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10666)|
| 2:57:47| Also, I know, because I did read the whole packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10667)|
| 2:57:50| there's, and you all mentioned this, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10670)|
| 2:57:52| there's seven recommendations, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10672)|
| 2:57:53| There are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10673)|
| 2:57:54| You brought, you're bringing one, only one recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10674)|
| 2:57:57| for approval, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10677)|
| 2:57:59| Because that's the three pages we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10679)|
| 2:58:00| That's the conversion to the new salary scales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10680)|
| 2:58:04| Is there, should the board anticipate you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10684)|
| 2:58:06| bringing other recommendations, or do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10686)|
| 2:58:10| feel like you have the authority through the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10690)|
| 2:58:13| to act on all the other ones except for this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10693)|
| 2:58:16| And then, do you have some sense about how you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10696)|
| 2:58:19| going to act on the other ones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10699)|
| 2:58:20| You've identified some things, like starting this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10700)|
| 2:58:22| already, that you intend to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10702)|
| 2:58:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10704)|
| 2:58:25| So I believe that right now, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10705)|
| 2:58:29| is the only recommendation for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10709)|
| 2:58:33| The other recommendations we intend to take in some capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10713)|
| 2:58:38| one of them is the classification system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10718)|
| 2:58:40| on how we slot employees into, or how we place employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10720)|
| 2:58:44| on the new scale, determining market value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10724)|
| 2:58:47| through the classification system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10727)|
| 2:58:49| So that's all contingent on the new salary schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10729)|
| 2:58:53| being approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10733)|
| 2:58:54| I will say, like we've discussed in the individual meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10734)|
| 2:58:58| some of the recommendations are for the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10738)|
| 2:59:01| what we may need to do in the future to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10741)|
| 2:59:04| So implementing those right now, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10744)|
| 2:59:07| would not do, because those are for some time in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10747)|
| 2:59:11| One of the recommendations is to convene the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10751)|
| 2:59:14| like Mr. Bolton described, to develop payroll procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10754)|
| 2:59:18| So I believe that the vote, the one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10758)|
| 2:59:22| would be required for a vote is the move to a new salary schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10762)|
| 2:59:25| That's what I want to get at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10765)|
| 2:59:26| So required by what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10766)|
| 2:59:27| Because I think it's important for the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10767)|
| 2:59:29| system and the general public to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10769)|
| 2:59:31| that there's some recommendations you all can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10771)|
| 2:59:33| just act on, and then there's some that need a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10773)|
| 2:59:35| And so why is this one, is it requiring a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10775)|
| 2:59:38| demanding a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10778)|
| 2:59:39| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10779)|
| 2:59:39| So board policy does say that the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10779)|
| 2:59:43| will set teacher salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10783)|
| 2:59:45| And in addition to that, this is a huge budgetary commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10785)|
| 2:59:51| and also a huge shift in the way that we approach compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10791)|
| 2:59:57| We have not made a change of this magnitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10797)|
| 3:00:01| to our salary schedules in decades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10801)|
| 3:00:05| and so are bringing that before the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10805)|
| 3:00:08| before we move in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10808)|
| 3:00:10| And all other recommendations are really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10810)|
| 3:00:11| dependent on this one, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10811)|
| 3:00:12| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10812)|
| 3:00:13| Depending on what you do on this will affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10813)|
| 3:00:14| all the other recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10814)|
| 3:00:16| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10816)|
| 3:00:17| One of the recommendations that was in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10817)|
| 3:00:18| was doing some micro studies year to year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10818)|
| 3:00:22| but also doing kind of another deep dive every three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10822)|
| 3:00:24| to five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10824)|
| 3:00:25| So one of the recommendations was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10825)|
| 3:00:28| once we transition to the new scales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10828)|
| 3:00:31| should the board vote in that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10831)|
| 3:00:34| that if we are experiencing hard to staff areas on the new scales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10834)|
| 3:00:38| that we consider whether specific positions should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10838)|
| 3:00:42| be identified for an additional salary study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10842)|
| 3:00:45| And then yes, another one of the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10845)|
| 3:00:47| was we consider every three to five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10847)|
| 3:00:50| doing a comprehensive salary study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10850)|
| 3:00:52| So I want to hone in on that one for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10852)|
| 3:00:55| You mentioned when you first presented this to us last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10855)|
| 3:00:58| that you all were looking at doing a study that we haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10858)|
| 3:01:00| done one in 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10860)|
| 3:01:02| I think what we don't want to do is wake up in 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10862)|
| 3:01:05| and realize, oops, we did it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10865)|
| 3:01:08| So I don't know where the board could act on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10868)|
| 3:01:12| if that makes sense to put that in policy or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10872)|
| 3:01:14| I don't know if that's where that should live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10874)|
| 3:01:16| But the idea of codifying the practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10876)|
| 3:01:19| that at least every five years we do a salary study, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10879)|
| 3:01:23| could be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10883)|
| 3:01:23| So I would challenge the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10883)|
| 3:01:26| to give some thought about, one, do you all really want that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10886)|
| 3:01:29| But also, what's the right mechanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10889)|
| 3:01:31| to ensure that does happen as leadership changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10891)|
| 3:01:33| as board changes, all the type of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10893)|
| 3:01:36| Because that's why a salary study hasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10896)|
| 3:01:38| been done in 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10898)|
| 3:01:39| Because there was nothing that codified it that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10899)|
| 3:01:41| we're going to do it at some frequency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10901)|
| 3:01:43| So nobody made the intentional decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10903)|
| 3:01:44| to not do it for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10904)|
| 3:01:46| It just happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10906)|
| 3:01:48| And then I think I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10908)|
| 3:01:50| I think it's for Mr. Bolton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10910)|
| 3:01:52| I know you all were not directly copied on the email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10912)|
| 3:01:55| that Lance referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10915)|
| 3:01:58| It was only the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10918)|
| 3:02:00| Has anybody in the administration seen that email?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10920)|
| 3:02:02| Have you all seen that math?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10922)|
| 3:02:06| Yes, I have seen the email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10926)|
| 3:02:07| I have not done the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10927)|
| 3:02:10| I have not checked the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10930)|
| 3:02:11| I've just seen the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10931)|
| 3:02:14| Yeah, I didn't look at his formulas and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10934)|
| 3:02:16| He didn't send his spreadsheet and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10936)|
| 3:02:18| which is completely fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10938)|
| 3:02:19| But to me, I think what he's trying to articulate there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10939)|
| 3:02:22| and I don't know if it's right or wrong in terms of his math| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10942)|
| 3:02:25| and all the things, but I think the question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10945)|
| 3:02:29| what's the total value of somebody's compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10949)|
| 3:02:33| or a teacher's compensation over 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10953)|
| 3:02:35| if you break it out this way versus if you break it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10955)|
| 3:02:38| this way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10958)|
| 3:02:38| We know that in the general scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10958)|
| 3:02:40| I think this is right, that it's a 65% spread all the way down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10960)|
| 3:02:44| correct, between low end and high end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10964)|
| 3:02:47| It's actually not 65% on the teacher scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10967)|
| 3:02:49| I'm pretty sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10969)|
| 3:02:50| I didn't bring my packet with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10970)|
| 3:02:51| I left it on my coffee table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10971)|
| 3:02:53| I think the Evergreen notes say it's actually 50-something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10973)|
| 3:02:56| percent, but in my math, it's 63% every time I do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10976)|
| 3:03:00| That's the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10980)|
| 3:03:01| So two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10981)|
| 3:03:02| One is, why is Evergreen making a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10982)|
| 3:03:05| for a different spread for the teacher scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10985)|
| 3:03:09| versus the general scale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10989)|
| 3:03:11| And then, to me, it's novel in the sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10991)|
| 3:03:16| of I didn't think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10996)|
| 3:03:17| I didn't beat Lance to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10997)|
| 3:03:18| But to me, the idea of looking at total value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=10998)|
| 3:03:20| is probably not a novel idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11000)|
| 3:03:23| I'm assuming you all probably have done some of your own math| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11003)|
| 3:03:25| even if you haven't looked at his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11005)|
| 3:03:27| Can you talk to us about that in relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11007)|
| 3:03:30| to what Ms. Olin was pointing out in terms of the bumps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11010)|
| 3:03:34| There was some intentionality to do it at 5 and 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11014)|
| 3:03:37| but also curious about the total value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11017)|
| 3:03:39| because I think, yeah, that's worth something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11019)|
| 3:03:43| Madam Chair, board members, now this is just speculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11023)|
| 3:03:47| I've not put paper to pencil, and so I need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11027)|
| 3:03:50| But if you look at that percent that you've increased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11030)|
| 3:03:53| what is not included in that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11033)|
| 3:03:55| be the full spread of those additional degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11035)|
| 3:03:58| So then if you add, for example, for the largest spread, $5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11038)|
| 3:04:02| to it, you may come closer to that 68%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11042)|
| 3:04:05| when you're looking at the full range spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11045)|
| 3:04:07| So you have that compression because it's only on two bands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11047)|
| 3:04:10| But I have not done the full analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11050)|
| 3:04:13| on what it would look like in terms of a career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11053)|
| 3:04:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11057)|
| 3:04:18| And Lance, when he did it, he sent us if it's just equalized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11058)|
| 3:04:24| but there's no way to do it for another position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11064)|
| 3:04:26| because we don't know where any of these other positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11066)|
| 3:04:29| are going to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11069)|
| 3:04:32| To me, that's an interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11072)|
| 3:04:35| I'm not suggesting that we necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11075)|
| 3:04:37| postpone our decision, although if we oopsed into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11077)|
| 3:04:42| like, oh my gosh, we didn't realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11082)|
| 3:04:44| we were potentially taking $20,000 away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11084)|
| 3:04:48| over the life of somebody's 20-year tenure as a teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11088)|
| 3:04:51| to me, that's like, we should probably think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11091)|
| 3:04:54| I mean, I get the reason to do incentive bonuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11094)|
| 3:04:57| And a lot of what I see in here addresses a lot of the challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11097)|
| 3:05:01| that I read through my work at Georgetown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11101)|
| 3:05:03| and my certificate for education finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11103)|
| 3:05:05| I mean, I get all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11105)|
| 3:05:08| But that's the one thing that is interesting to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11108)|
| 3:05:10| And I'm wondering if the school system has considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11110)|
| 3:05:14| the trade-offs of doing those larger bumps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11114)|
| 3:05:19| without increasing the total over the 20-year period, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11119)|
| 3:05:23| Because then, in effect, what you do is you do shorten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11123)|
| 3:05:25| you do decrease the value of the life of the tenure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11125)|
| 3:05:29| Does that make sense, what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11129)|
| 3:05:31| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11131)|
| 3:05:32| Well, I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11132)|
| 3:05:34| Speaking as an old math teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11134)|
| 3:05:35| I think when you look at that number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11135)|
| 3:05:37| I don't think that you would see a difference between that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11137)|
| 3:05:39| because you're looking at values that have been equalized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11139)|
| 3:05:42| over a longer period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11142)|
| 3:05:43| So I think that it's not necessarily the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11143)|
| 3:05:47| that you would see any withholding of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11147)|
| 3:05:49| because you're looking at the same spread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11149)|
| 3:05:51| over a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11151)|
| 3:05:52| So for example, if you're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11152)|
| 3:05:55| what you're looking at is a stair step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11155)|
| 3:05:56| And so the midpoints of each stair step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11156)|
| 3:05:58| are gonna be exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11158)|
| 3:06:00| So as you round it, there's not gonna be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11160)|
| 3:06:01| any kind of difference between what a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11161)|
| 3:06:04| that progressed through those would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11164)|
| 3:06:06| as compared to somebody who progressed at equilateral steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11166)|
| 3:06:09| I think the area under the curve, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11169)|
| 3:06:12| would be equivalent in both of those scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11172)|
| 3:06:15| I've not put paper to pencil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11175)|
| 3:06:17| but just thinking through that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11177)|
| 3:06:19| it looks to be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11179)|
| 3:06:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11180)|
| 3:06:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11181)|
| 3:06:29| I know Ms. Horne, you wanted to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11189)|
| 3:06:30| and then Ms. Christie, did you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11190)|
| 3:06:32| I think we have some guests here from Illinois.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11192)|
| 3:06:33| Well, I just had a question, I don't know what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11193)|
| 3:06:36| this might be a Mr. Sanders question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11196)|
| 3:06:38| but I know Carter Elementary has been waiting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11198)|
| 3:06:41| and they have to get up really early in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11201)|
| 3:06:44| I don't know if there's any way we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11204)|
| 3:06:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11207)|
| 3:06:53| Sorry, Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11213)|
| 3:06:56| I tried, just so you know, I tried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11216)|
| 3:06:59| Yeah, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11219)|
| 3:07:01| Okay, I'll try to make this quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11221)|
| 3:07:02| I'm sorry, y'all are waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11222)|
| 3:07:03| Okay, so I just want to say thank you to the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11223)|
| 3:07:07| for all the hard work to get to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11227)|
| 3:07:10| and even going back to last year's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11230)|
| 3:07:12| because obviously that's what's causing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11232)|
| 3:07:15| part of what's causing us to be able to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11235)|
| 3:07:20| And, you know, if we think back many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11240)|
| 3:07:22| over the past several months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11242)|
| 3:07:23| we've had so many conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11243)|
| 3:07:25| that centered around the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11245)|
| 3:07:26| that we need to be able to pay custodians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11246)|
| 3:07:30| and secretaries and nutrition more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11250)|
| 3:07:33| so that we could retain those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11253)|
| 3:07:34| So to be able to bring them up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11254)|
| 3:07:37| this mic is going in and out, I'm so sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11257)|
| 3:07:39| but to be able to bring them up to market value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11259)|
| 3:07:41| is tremendous, and so I'm very thankful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11261)|
| 3:07:45| And there are still a lot of questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11265)|
| 3:07:47| and it's hard to have those questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11267)|
| 3:07:50| but I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11270)|
| 3:07:56| can be patient hearing that the big takeaways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11276)|
| 3:07:58| that all staff will have increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11278)|
| 3:08:01| some at higher percentages than others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11281)|
| 3:08:04| since some are already paid closer to market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11284)|
| 3:08:09| But the fact that everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11289)|
| 3:08:10| will be getting an increase is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11290)|
| 3:08:14| And just to make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11294)|
| 3:08:16| I know you've said this already, Ms. Hemelgarn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11296)|
| 3:08:18| but just to make sure everybody knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11298)|
| 3:08:20| that you will be coming out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11300)|
| 3:08:23| with the same kind of salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11303)|
| 3:08:25| the teacher scale that we're seeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11305)|
| 3:08:27| where you can see the increases year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11307)|
| 3:08:30| You'll be coming out with that same scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11310)|
| 3:08:32| for each job classification, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11312)|
| 3:08:36| Madam Chair, Ms. Horne, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11316)|
| 3:08:38| So if the board approves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11318)|
| 3:08:41| when we post the full new salary schedule on the website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11321)|
| 3:08:46| it will be very easy to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11326)|
| 3:08:49| what someone paid on an annual basis would make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11329)|
| 3:08:51| So we will convert for our 200 day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11331)|
| 3:08:55| our 211, our 221, 255 annual salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11335)|
| 3:08:58| And also for SLC and instructional coaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11338)|
| 3:09:01| all of those, all those pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11341)|
| 3:09:04| So I think that those answers will come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11344)|
| 3:09:08| And I think that having that transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11348)|
| 3:09:11| will also help us to be able to retain staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11351)|
| 3:09:15| because we're obviously competing with those around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11355)|
| 3:09:19| So that will help us retain staff, which I think is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11359)|
| 3:09:23| And so it's difficult to approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11363)|
| 3:09:27| without having all of the answers that we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11367)|
| 3:09:30| But if we approve this now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11370)|
| 3:09:33| that allows them to get to work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11373)|
| 3:09:34| And I think that's what is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11374)|
| 3:09:37| And I think just, again, tremendous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11377)|
| 3:09:40| that we're able to have this opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11380)|
| 3:09:43| to make sure that all of our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11383)|
| 3:09:46| are being paid market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11386)|
| 3:09:49| And I think that's what we need to hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11389)|
| 3:09:51| is that that's the goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11391)|
| 3:09:53| is to get everybody to be at market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11393)|
| 3:09:55| So thank you for the tremendous work that you're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11395)|
| 3:09:58| and that you will be doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11398)|
| 3:09:59| because it's a big job that you have ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11399)|
| 3:10:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11400)|

| 3:10:17| I think we were voting on calling for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11417)|
| 3:10:19| So you recuse yourself on calling for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11419)|

| 3:11:26| I know Ms. Jellicourse is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11486)|
| 3:11:29| the administrator for Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11489)|
| 3:11:30| and I believe our assistant principal, Ms. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11490)|
| 3:11:36| And not to leave out our cafeteria manager, Ms. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11496)|
| 3:11:43| And just to go back, they did come to our meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11503)|
| 3:11:47| the other day and they just had so many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11507)|
| 3:11:49| inspirational things to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11509)|
| 3:11:54| I know it's been a long night for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11514)|
| 3:11:55| but I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11515)|
| 3:11:58| And I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11518)|
| 3:11:59| In hindsight, we should have bumped you up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11519)|
| 3:12:01| It just, sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11521)|
| 3:12:04| No, you're great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11524)|
| 3:12:05| So I'm Emily Jellicourse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11525)|
| 3:12:06| I'm the principal at Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11526)|
| 3:12:08| This is Stephanie Jones, our assistant principal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11528)|
| 3:12:09| Amanda Brown, our cafeteria manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11529)|
| 3:12:12| And so we just wanted to come and thank you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11532)|
| 3:12:13| first of all, for even considering the nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11533)|
| 3:12:17| Ms. Sandro recently retired from Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11537)|
| 3:12:20| after about 35 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11540)|
| 3:12:22| most of that in our nutrition department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11542)|
| 3:12:24| most of that at Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11544)|
| 3:12:26| She is a staple of Carter Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11546)|
| 3:12:28| and has served and loved on generations of Hornets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11548)|
| 3:12:33| So what better way to honor this beloved community member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11553)|
| 3:12:38| than honoring her with a permanent space in our school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11558)|
| 3:12:42| So we would just appreciate your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11562)|
| 3:12:46| I'll let Amanda talk a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11566)|
| 3:12:48| but we just appreciate the time and consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11568)|
| 3:12:50| in naming this facility for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11570)|
| 3:12:55| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11575)|
| 3:12:56| I do want to thank you guys for this opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11576)|
| 3:12:58| to come and speak to you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11578)|
| 3:13:00| and allowing me to speak on the naming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11580)|
| 3:13:02| of the Carter Elementary cafeteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11582)|
| 3:13:05| I'm going to do my very best to not get emotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11585)|
| 3:13:09| Again, my name is Amanda Brown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11589)|
| 3:13:10| and I am the cafeteria manager at Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11590)|
| 3:13:13| I was asked by Ms. Sandro's daughters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11593)|
| 3:13:16| who were wanting to keep Ms. Sandro's legacy in our school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11596)|
| 3:13:19| after her retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11599)|

| 3:15:14| from Carter High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11714)|

| 3:15:30| As the manager of Carter Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11730)|
| 3:15:32| this is the biggest honor I've ever been given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11732)|
| 3:15:34| the opportunity to part in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11734)|
| 3:15:37| And I want to add this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11737)|
| 3:15:38| This actually happened yesterday in our school cafeteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11738)|
| 3:15:42| We served homemade macaroni and cheese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11742)|
| 3:15:45| So today, a student in the third grade came in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11745)|
| 3:15:49| and asked, and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11749)|
| 3:15:52| is there any more of Ms. Sandro's mac and cheese?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11752)|
| 3:15:57| Ms. Sandro has been retired for three months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11757)|
| 3:16:00| two weeks, and two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11760)|

| 3:16:12| for many, many students in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11772)|

| 3:17:50| Miss Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11870)|
| 3:17:51| – Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11871)|
| 3:17:53| I'll be very short on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11873)|
| 3:17:56| So the Carnes Community Fair is such an integral part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11876)|
| 3:18:00| I think that when people attend, they almost forget that it's in a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11880)|
| 3:18:06| And what happens is we end up with a lot of political advertisements inside the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11886)|
| 3:18:13| And it happens year after year after year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11893)|
| 3:18:16| Every time we think that we have taken care of the situation, it's back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11896)|
| 3:18:21| And I don't think it's a purposeful thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11901)|
| 3:18:23| I think it's just happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11903)|
| 3:18:26| And so just to get some clarity, I'd like to ask Dr. Adams if there is a way that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11906)|
| 3:18:32| can help ensure that everyone understands that political advertising in a school is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11912)|
| 3:18:39| illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11919)|
| 3:18:40| It's not just a policy thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11920)|
| 3:18:42| So that we can make sure that we don't end up in a bad situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11922)|
| 3:18:45| – Madam Chair, members of the board, thank you, Miss Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11925)|

| 3:19:55| And our goal every year was, how can we make the students better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=11995)|
| 3:20:00| We've had Mount Olive students to go on to college, to go to trade school, become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12000)|
| 3:20:05| loving moms and dads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12005)|
| 3:20:08| We've had valedictorians, salutatorians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12008)|
| 3:20:10| One year, South Dole High School even had the valedictorian and salutatorian from Mount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12010)|
| 3:20:16| Olive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12016)|
| 3:20:17| You just witnessed one of my former students speak a few moments ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12017)|
| 3:20:21| I'm so proud of her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12021)|
| 3:20:24| And this year, we're even a reward school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12024)|
| 3:20:28| So you can imagine our surprise when we were told a few weeks ago that we were having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12028)|
| 3:20:33| cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12033)|
| 3:20:35| And we are no longer going to have a PAC teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12035)|
| 3:20:38| And our teachers really depend on PAC for behavior issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12038)|
| 3:20:44| We were also told that our office personnel was going to be cut from two full-time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12044)|
| 3:20:50| a full-time and a part-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12050)|
| 3:20:52| And I don't know when the last time you've been in a school office, but it can get hairy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12052)|
| 3:20:59| with all the needs that have to be met five minutes ago, and letting school or letting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12059)|
| 3:21:06| visitors in, making sure that the visitors are safe for our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12066)|
| 3:21:11| And there's concern about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12071)|
| 3:21:13| We also are losing our kindergarten assistant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12073)|
| 3:21:17| And I see her quite often in the hallway, testing kindergartners on letter recognition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12077)|
| 3:21:23| letter sounds, math facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12083)|
| 3:21:25| And that's a lot to be asking kindergarten teachers to be teaching the curriculum and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12085)|
| 3:21:30| then having to test individually as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12090)|
| 3:21:34| That's very time-consuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12094)|
| 3:21:37| And kindergarten is very constant, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12097)|
| 3:21:40| And we're also losing our tutors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12100)|
| 3:21:43| We've had full-time and a part-time, and I'm the part-time this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12103)|
| 3:21:48| And our full-time tutors, what they have done is they have collaborated with the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12108)|
| 3:21:53| teachers on reading goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12113)|
| 3:21:56| And the tutored students, they hear the vocabulary words in the tutoring sessions, and then they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12116)|
| 3:22:04| hear them in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12124)|
| 3:22:05| So they're hearing them twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12125)|
| 3:22:07| And the teachers are reporting that these students have increased their confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12127)|
| 3:22:12| They've increased their motivation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12132)|
| 3:22:15| And we even had a teacher or a student tell a teacher, a tutoring person, that that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12135)|
| 3:22:22| his favorite part of the day, that he loved it so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12142)|
| 3:22:27| So in conclusion, what I'm asking is, just let us continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12147)|
| 3:22:32| We are making a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12152)|
| 3:22:34| And we need our full-time tutors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12154)|
| 3:22:36| But I'd also like, when you're going over the budget, to consider part-time tutors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12156)|
| 3:22:42| That my hesitation in retiring was, will I lose my purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12162)|
| 3:22:47| And working part-time for me has allowed me to still teach and be a part of my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12167)|
| 3:22:53| And it's also allowed me time to take my mother to the doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12173)|
| 3:22:58| So one more thing, as you're deciding about the budget, consider what one of Tennessee's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12178)|
| 3:23:04| best has said, Coach Pat Summitt, you win in life with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12184)|
| 3:23:09| And when teachers are supported, students are too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12189)|
| 3:23:12| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12192)|
| 3:23:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12194)|
| 3:23:15| Michael Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12195)|
| 3:23:18| Michael Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12198)|
| 3:23:19| If you want to check, I'll move on to the last one, and then we can come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12199)|
| 3:23:27| Denzel Grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12207)|
| 3:23:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12208)|
| 3:23:29| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12209)|
| 3:23:30| Then we can check on Michael in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12210)|
| 3:23:32| Denzel, if you'll state your name and county of residence, you'll have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12212)|
| 3:23:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12215)|
| 3:23:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12216)|
| 3:23:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12217)|
| 3:23:38| My name is Denzel Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12218)|
| 3:23:39| Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12219)|
| 3:23:41| I currently serve as the Executive Director of Turn Up Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12221)|
| 3:23:45| Turn Up Knox, we're a violence interruption program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12225)|
| 3:23:47| We've been partnered with the city over the last 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12227)|
| 3:23:51| My reason for coming today is really just to raise an issue and concerns that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12231)|
| 3:23:57| as an organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12237)|
| 3:23:59| Through the last 18 months, we've kind of been able to build relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12239)|
| 3:24:05| In a brief period of time, they were able to go into Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12245)|
| 3:24:10| We've been able to create a partnership with United Ways Community Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12250)|
| 3:24:13| They've kind of been able to allow us to piggyback off the influence that they have to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12253)|
| 3:24:18| to come into Knox County schools and just build relationships with the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12258)|
| 3:24:25| Just to give a little background on our program and what we've done, the last year alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12265)|
| 3:24:28| our practices have played a huge role in decreasing gun violence in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12268)|
| 3:24:33| Homicides are down 33% compared to last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12273)|
| 3:24:38| East Knoxville is down 52% compared to last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12278)|
| 3:24:42| TBI reports also show that juvenile crime was at a 10-year low, actually, last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12282)|
| 3:24:50| I would like to humbly thank not only my staff, but community members who played a role in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12290)|
| 3:24:55| that decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12295)|
| 3:24:58| As you can see, I'm not necessarily here to speak about an item on the agenda, but I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12298)|
| 3:25:02| want to talk about and advocate for the presence and how important it is to have community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12302)|
| 3:25:07| members in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12307)|
| 3:25:09| The school district, obviously, as we know, released a discipline report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12309)|
| 3:25:14| Obviously, those results showed that black students as well as low-income students are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12314)|
| 3:25:19| suspended more than any other race in our community and in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12319)|
| 3:25:27| In reading that report and reading the news report, I can agree with Joe Maddox, who is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12327)|
| 3:25:33| the co-president of Justice Knox, when he says that it is important that we give everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12333)|
| 3:25:37| in our community and all the kids in our community the best chance that we can afford in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12337)|
| 3:25:42| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12342)|
| 3:25:43| I also believe Director of School Culture, Janice Cook, who I've been able to have conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12343)|
| 3:25:49| with, when she says that we are looking to put structures in place that include Pacific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12349)|
| 3:25:54| schools and strengthen the support we can give both students and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12354)|
| 3:26:00| Mr. Butler actually just spoke about policy, and when it comes to volunteers and coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12360)|
| 3:26:05| into the schools, both Level 1 and Level 2 volunteers are not required to have a full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12365)|
| 3:26:11| extensive background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12371)|
| 3:26:13| Only Level 3 and Level 4 volunteers have to successfully complete a background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12373)|
| 3:26:20| Myself and our program staff will fall underneath that Level 1 and Level 2 volunteer requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12380)|
| 3:26:27| Again, this is not an attack on you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12387)|
| 3:26:32| This is just simply an ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12392)|
| 3:26:33| What do I need to do to get my program into Knox County Schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12393)|
| 3:26:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12397)|
| 3:26:38| Thank you, Denzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12398)|
| 3:26:39| No Michael?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12399)|
| 3:26:40| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12400)|
| 3:26:41| Then that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12401)|
| 3:26:51| With that, our meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12411)|
| 3:26:53| Thanks for being here, y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=12413)|
