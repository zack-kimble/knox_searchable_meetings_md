| 0:00:57| Nox County Commission Meeting. Merry Christmas, happy holidays to everyone. We appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=57)|
| 0:01:00| your being here. We'd like to begin with our public forum. Mr. John Kennerly has asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=60)|
| 0:01:06| to address us. Mr. Kennerly, if you would come to the microphone, please, and give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=66)|
| 0:01:10| your name and address for the record, and you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=70)|
| 0:01:14| Thank you, Chairman Hammond and the Vice-Chairman Anders, commissioners, members of the Metropolitan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=74)|
| 0:01:22| Planning Commission and my fellow citizens. My name is John Kennerly. I'm a resident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=82)|
| 0:01:28| of Knox County, residing at 1711 Vander Ridge Lane. I want to thank the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=88)|
| 0:01:36| for the opportunity to bring to your attention the matter involving Rural Metro during an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=96)|
| 0:01:42| emergency response to my home on June the 10th. I had fallen in the house, and no one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=102)|
| 0:01:49| was home but me. I cut my lips and was semi-conscious from the fall when my next-door neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=109)|
| 0:01:57| and another close friend found me because I didn't answer either my phone or the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=117)|
| 0:02:05| and I was bleeding and semi-conscious. The neighbor made the call to 911 at about 1247| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=125)|
| 0:02:12| on June the 10th. There was only a neighbor, my close friend, and my neighbor's daughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=132)|
| 0:02:18| present during that time. And so what I'm about to tell you gives me grave concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=138)|
| 0:02:26| for my fellow Knox Countians who might be in a similar situation and not able to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=146)|
| 0:02:32| care of themselves when firefighters and EMTs enter the home. After I was put in the ambulance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=152)|
| 0:02:40| the EMTs and firefighters began a search of my home. One of the witnesses observed two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=160)|
| 0:02:47| Rural Metro personnel in my bedroom closet rifling through my personal property. My| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=167)|
| 0:02:55| 9mm Browning pistol in a zippered case was located on the top of the dresser in my closet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=175)|
| 0:03:02| near where the searching was taking place. There was also a diamond ring on the bureau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=182)|
| 0:03:10| in a tray nearby. Both were missing when I returned home following the treatment at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=190)|
| 0:03:16| emergency room. Eventually in October of this year, I found the case from the 9mm gun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=196)|
| 0:03:24| hidden behind some clothes and still containing one of the shells for the gun. However, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=204)|
| 0:03:32| gun and the ring have not been found. Statements were made by Rural Metro responders to my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=212)|
| 0:03:38| friends while they were rifling through my personal things that I might hurt myself or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=218)|
| 0:03:44| others. A firefighter asked my three friends, where does John keep his guns and would all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=224)|
| 0:03:51| of you help us search for them? My friends declined saying they didn't know anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| about my guns. From what I have been told, one of the firefighters began opening drawers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=236)|
| 0:04:03| and cabinets in my several rooms in my personal spaces. In a large 20-drawer filing cabinet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=243)|
| 0:04:12| my unloaded target pistol was found and removed to a box. In the kitchen island,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=252)|
| 0:04:18| the firefighters located another small unloaded handgun and placed it in the box with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| ammunition for that gun. As they were leaving, the firefighters gave the box to my neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=264)|
| 0:04:31| insisting that she take it for safekeeping. They told her it wasn't safe for me to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=271)|
| 0:04:38| guns in the house and how in the heck they know that, I don't know. I have a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| to carry and I have been a gun collector and a marksman for many years and I take offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=283)|
| 0:04:51| at that statement about me to my neighbor. At one point during the search in my house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=291)|
| 0:04:57| my friends were asked by Rural Metro personnel to leave the bedroom and the TV room and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| continued their search. This, of course, gave Rural Metro personnel the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=302)|
| 0:05:08| to convert my property without being observed. Upon my return from the hospital, I noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=308)|
| 0:05:16| that my 9mm pistol and its case were missing as well as the diamond ring. I assumed at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=316)|
| 0:05:22| that time that the pistol was in the box given to my neighbor. Upon examining the contents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| of that box, the pistol was not there and neither was the diamond ring. I discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=328)|
| 0:05:35| this with all of them and my neighbors and friends who were at my home and I firmly believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=335)|
| 0:05:43| that these two items were taken during Rural Metro's visit. I made a sheriff's report in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=343)|
| 0:05:50| August of 2001 and haven't heard anything from them. I have talked to Rural Metro Fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=350)|
| 0:05:56| and Ambulance Services personnel and they deny that they touched anything or that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=356)|
| 0:06:04| removed anything from my home. This heightens my suspicions since my neighbors and friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=364)|
| 0:06:10| saw them rifling through my personal property and opening and searching drawers and cabinets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=370)|
| 0:06:16| and removing my property. Mr. Kennelly, your time is up. Would you like to wrap it up for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| us, please? I will. I think that the commission needs to look into this and as a private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=380)|
| 0:06:28| citizen, I can't stand Rural Metro and the county government trying to do, if they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=388)|
| 0:06:37| do this for me and I appreciate it. Thank you. I have just a question. Yes. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=397)|
| 0:06:42| this is a question of theft. What did the sheriff's report say about it after they did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| their investigation? They haven't done one. Okay. I guess this was reported to them as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=406)|
| 0:06:57| a theft? It was reported as a theft in August. Thank you. Mr. Chairman. Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=417)|
| 0:07:08| Let me not offer a response but a comment. I have obviously formerly represented the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=428)|
| 0:07:13| 4th District where Mr. Kennelly lives. I know Mr. Kennelly and have had lots of conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| with him about this. I'm certainly sympathetic to his concerns but he and I have, as we debated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=438)|
| 0:07:25| this and talked about it, I did tell him that this was a forum for him to come and express| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| his concerns. Please, Joe, correct me if I say something inappropriate but that it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=450)|
| 0:07:37| not, that commission could not adjudicate or arbitrate this issue. It was between basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=457)|
| 0:07:43| private parties but I appreciate him bringing it to our attention and to the public's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=463)|
| 0:07:51| I'm not taking a side on it. I have told him that there are other, I've suggested that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| there are other recourse, there are other, that the courts and other methods available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| for him to address his theft and obviously the sheriff's department are the ones to investigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=480)|
| 0:08:08| it and not county commission. John, thanks for making this, bringing this to our attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| and I appreciate you coming up here today. Commissioner Aldermeyer. Yeah, I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=492)|
| 0:08:18| say, I've talked to Mr. Kennelly a couple of times, several times about this and I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=498)|
| 0:08:24| with Commissioner Shouse, this is not the forum that we can adjudicate anything from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=504)|
| 0:08:32| this bench but I would like if anybody from the sheriff's office can look into this date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=512)|
| 0:08:41| to see if there was a report done. If not, then get back with Mr. Kennelly to find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| what the results was but as far as dictating from here, I've told Mr. Kennelly this a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| of times that it would have to be taken through that course to alleviate any dispute between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=532)|
| 0:09:00| rural metro and him but I would ask the sheriff to look into that date to see why a report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=540)|
| 0:09:06| wasn't done. Somebody stole the guns and so we don't know who it is, I mean we have no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=546)|
| 0:09:14| investigative powers but obviously there was a theft and I hope it can be resolved favorably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| Mr. Kennelly, thank you so much for addressing us today. Thank you for your attention, thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| you. The next person signed up to speak to us is Stan Gluckner, I think I may have gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| that correct, if not, please correct me. If you'd give us your address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| please. Good afternoon, the family says Gluckner but I've been called all sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=573)|
| 0:09:40| And your address please. I use a post office box 6204-37950, I live at 6210 High Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=580)|
| 0:09:48| which is in the neighborhood of Cumberland Estates. Yes sir, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=588)|
| 0:09:58| Okay, you know for the past couple of years and I've been paying somewhat close attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=598)|
| 0:10:04| to county commission, I've been confused by the commission's use of substitute motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=604)|
| 0:10:11| Particularly, and I'm going to use maybe the last example that comes to mind which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=611)|
| 0:10:18| was your hillside and ridgetop protection plan where Commissioner Briggs, rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=618)|
| 0:10:25| amending the motion to add three paragraphs, made a substitute motion. When I read Robert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=625)|
| 0:10:33| Rules of Order, a substitute motion is a motion to amend. So how you amend it I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=633)|
| 0:10:43| is up to you. It seems to me that substitute, well I'm not, like I say, I'm not sure what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=643)|
| 0:10:53| the mystery of the substitute motion is all about. But if you read Robert Rules of Order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=653)|
| 0:11:00| it clearly states that a substitute motion only amends the resolution which remains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| pending as amended. Now going back to last month, if I'm not mistaken, there was only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| one motion made and that was a motion to adopt the motion as amended, well with the amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=672)|
| 0:11:20| which I guess is another way of saying you voted on the substitute motion, which leaves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=680)|
| 0:11:28| that motion on the floor as a pending motion. And if my memory serves me correctly, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=688)|
| 0:11:36| has happened many times that you voted on a substitute motion and you haven't gone back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=696)|
| 0:11:44| and voted on the motion as amended. So I don't know where that leaves the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=704)|
| 0:11:52| or the county. I'm just tossing this out for your information as a citizen who's been observing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=712)|
| 0:12:00| the process. I know Mr. Jarrett's been talking about coming up with a substitute rules of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=720)|
| 0:12:06| procedure, which simplified rules of procedure, which is probably the way to go, so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=726)|
| 0:12:16| it's clear to citizens, it's clear to the Commission what it's all about. Robert's Rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| of Order gets extremely detailed. And he's made reference to North Carolina. And North| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=741)|
| 0:12:29| Carolina has, well there's an attorney down there who's written rules of procedure for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=749)|
| 0:12:35| both government entities, for city councils, for county commissions. And he states in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=755)|
| 0:12:42| his notation, to avoid conclusion, substitute motions are not allowed under these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=762)|
| 0:12:49| All proposals for changes in a motion or in an amendment are treated as a motion to amend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=769)|
| 0:12:56| no matter how major their potential effect. So I guess I tossed that out that I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=776)|
| 0:13:03| suggest to the County Commission they think carefully about using motions to substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=783)|
| 0:13:10| a motion, and rather choose to amend main motions when on the floor, and then to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=790)|
| 0:13:17| up and actually vote on the motion as amended, rather than leave it as a pending motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=797)|
| 0:13:23| I thank you for your time. Yes, thank you, sir. And we appreciate your comments. I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| respond by saying this is why we have our law director, is if we're not doing something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| in proper fashion, he alerts us to that. So, Mr. Jarrett, if you would take his comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| under consideration. Thank you very much. Let's move now to the honorary resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=817)|
| 0:13:43| Clerk, if you would read our first resolution in the record, please. Resolution 101 is honoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| the Volunteer Ministry Center, VMC, and their efforts to relieve chronic homelessness on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| the one-year anniversary of the opening of Menivella Manor. Do we have a motion? Motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=834)|
| 0:14:01| to approve. Is there a second? All those in favor say aye. Aye. I had one. Why? I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=841)|
| 0:14:12| assuming this is unanimous, and I need to sign this. I'm sorry, Commissioner Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| That's okay. So, Commissioner Burwells, you are recognized. Thank you. Whereas, on November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=857)|

| 0:14:45| whereas, it is projected that Menivella will be at 100% capacity by the end of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| and as such, all 57 apartments will house tenants who, but for Menivella, would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| homeless. And whereas, two of the original 13 residents have progressed to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=896)|
| 0:15:03| that independent living is not only realistic, but preferable, as evidenced by the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| they are moving to apartments of their own and are gainfully employed. And whereas, during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=908)|
| 0:15:14| this year alone, the efforts of the VMC staff have resulted in 799 people being served for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=914)|
| 0:15:20| various needs, 608 people or families being helped with utility assistance, 85 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=920)|

| 0:15:53| persons assisted into housing by VMC do not return to the streets. And whereas, the Menivella| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=953)|

| 0:16:08| therefore, be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows, the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| of Knox County hereby honors VMC for their outstanding contributions toward reducing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| chronic homelessness in Knox County and for providing essential services to the most needy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| of persons. Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| its passage, as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| requiring it. Mr. Brawls. Thank you. I think you all know Jeannie Weatherstone, who is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=992)|
| 0:16:40| the Executive Director at Volunteer Ministry Center, and I'm pleased that she's here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| that I can give this to her. I am so impressed with the work that VMC does, and I especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1005)|
| 0:16:52| wanted to bring this resolution forward in recognition of what they've accomplished in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1012)|
| 0:16:58| the past year and the remarkable success rate they have in assisting people into homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1018)|
| 0:17:06| and in remaining there. They have a 92% success rate, which is phenomenal, and is probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1026)|
| 0:17:13| one of the highest in the country. And that means that one year after someone is helped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1033)|
| 0:17:19| into housing, they are still successfully housed. They have not returned to the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1039)|
| 0:17:26| And that's a critical part of these programs, is not just getting people into housing, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| helping them stay there. When Menvilla opened a year ago, there was a lot of controversy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1051)|
| 0:17:38| surrounding the location. There was a lot of controversy surrounding the concept of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1058)|
| 0:17:45| permanent supportive housing. There was a lot of controversy surrounding the cost associated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1065)|
| 0:17:51| And I'm very pleased to say that a year later, we are going to be at capacity for Menvilla| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1071)|
| 0:18:00| Manor and that it has shown a tremendous success rate for Knox County. And I'm very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1080)|
| 0:18:09| pleased to recognize the work that they have done over the past year and grateful to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1089)|
| 0:18:16| this wonderful nonprofit in our community. Jenny, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1096)|
| 0:18:22| Yes, I would. I think what I would want to say is a word of thanks. I think one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1102)|
| 0:18:28| things that we have learned during the 25 years of the existence of the Volunteer Ministry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1108)|
| 0:18:34| Center is that this is not easy work. And there is not one agency that can do it, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| even a group of agencies that can do it. Ending homelessness really is a community problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1120)|
| 0:18:48| and the community has the solution. One of the things that has so impressed us this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| has been the help of people throughout the community. And certainly, Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1133)|
| 0:18:59| has been one of the large helpers in making Menvilla come into being and then being successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1139)|
| 0:19:06| Churches have stepped up, individuals have stepped up. We are proud of what we are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1146)|
| 0:19:12| We're also proud of what we are learning that allows us to do it even better. None of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1152)|
| 0:19:19| would be possible without our partners and Knox County Commission is one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| So I thank you for this resolution and this recognition. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1169)|

| 0:19:49| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1189)|

| 0:19:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1191)|

| 0:19:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| It is approved. Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1194)|

| 0:20:19| So we're just very appreciative and we're glad we can honor him in this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| I think most of all, we want to thank him for helping keep his wife sane in 30 years of teaching for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1222)|
| 0:20:33| So we do appreciate that also, Mike. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1233)|

| 0:26:40| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| Several of us were at the service this Saturday for the induction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1604)|
| 0:26:54| swinging in the new city mayor and city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1614)|
| 0:27:01| In that service, Father Schreiber had an interesting take on his prayer or prior to his prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1621)|
| 0:27:13| He suggested that we have a new version of the song, God Bless America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1633)|
| 0:27:21| and instead substitute the phrase or the word Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1641)|
| 0:27:28| to those that are inclined who may be listening or watching today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| I think possibly the phrase Knox County would be more poetic and possibly more realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1652)|
| 0:27:42| I'm not going to sing, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| On December 14th, this month, last Wednesday, it's a real important day to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1668)|
| 0:27:57| I had kind of a miraculous experience in 2003 on December 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1677)|
| 0:28:05| So, irregardless of the things that have been happening with me and commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1685)|
| 0:28:12| I haven't been in the most wonderful of moods in the last month or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| but that day is so special to me that when I came down early that morning on the 14th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1697)|
| 0:28:32| well, it's just a celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| That's all I can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| It was a miraculous day in 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| So, anyway, I'm going into the living room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| and our house is just cluttered with all the Christmas stuff, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| and stacks of mail, unopened mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| And on top of a stack of unopened mail is a letter from the chairman of Knox County Commission, Mike Hamer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1733)|
| 0:29:01| Well, when I look at that, I go, uh-oh, I'm going to get called to the principal's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| given all the stuff that's been going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| But, of course, I open it, and it's just a form letter about the devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| And I go, well, should I do the devotional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1752)|
| 0:29:18| I don't really feel like doing the devotional, but immediately some scripture did come to my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1758)|
| 0:29:25| and therefore I've got to do the devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| You know, I've got to say the scripture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| They're very familiar, very important to me also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| So, anyway, I'd like to share those with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| They're not very seasonal, but they're extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| The first one is Jeremiah 2.13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| And in this scripture, God speaks to Jeremiah, and he says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1793)|
| 0:29:59| my people have committed two sins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| They have forsaken me, the spring of living water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1803)|
| 0:30:12| and have dug cisterns, broken cisterns that can hold no water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1812)|
| 0:30:20| The second scripture that came immediately to my mind was the first psalm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1820)|
| 0:30:28| And we all know the first psalm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| Blessed is the man that walks not in the counsel of the wicked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| but his delight is in the law of the Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| On this law he meditates day and night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| In all he does he prospers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| He will be like a tree planted by streams of water that bears its fruit in season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1852)|
| 0:31:00| and its leaf does not wither.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| In all he does he prospers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| For the wicked it is not so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| For they will be like chaff that the wind drives away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1869)|
| 0:31:21| Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1881)|
| 0:31:26| nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| For the Lord knows the way of the righteous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| and the way of the wicked will perish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1891)|
| 0:31:38| Thank you, Lord, for this Christmas season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| Many of us recognize your light and hope and healing to this world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1902)|
| 0:31:49| Government will be on your shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| Justice and righteousness will prevail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| God bless America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| God bless Knox County, the land that I love,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| and my home, sweet home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| Our pledge to the flag now from Commissioner Amy Rawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| Please stand and salute the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| one nation under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| Next is the approval of minutes of our previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1956)|

| 0:32:47| I have one, and that is I passed out the calendar for next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| our meeting schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| I'd like to add that to the agenda to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1972)|

| 0:32:58| Is there anything else that needs to be added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| or any other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=1981)|

| 0:33:35| They are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| Commissioners, would you like to go ahead and do the judicial appointment now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| or do the reading of the now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| Let's go ahead and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| Clerk, if you'd read item 112 into the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| Or 110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| This is a resolution approving the appointment of the judicial magistrate for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2030)|
| 0:33:58| We have eight individuals that have been recommended to us by the Sessions Court judges by resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2038)|
| 0:34:04| These are the individuals that will be considered for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| The way we will do that is that each commissioner will have an opportunity to recommend one person to be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2047)|
| 0:34:14| Should we have more than one applicant, we will vote on those applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| and we will continue voting until an individual receives six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2058)|
| 0:34:25| If no one receives six votes, the person with the lowest number of votes will be dropped off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| and then we will vote on the remaining candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| So, Mr. Law Director, is there anything else that we need to be mindful of with regards to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2078)|

| 0:43:07| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| Yes, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| Maybe a little bit out of order, but we had discussion on the 902, closing of Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2591)|
| 0:43:19| Is there any other discussion of that as we sit in full commission that people might like to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2599)|
| 0:43:26| I would suggest that we remove that from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| We have opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| And also I'm asking the same question then on 802, the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2612)|
| 0:43:39| I know there's been a couple of three things that have come out, like from the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| Could we possibly, if it's no more than just a discussion item later on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| I think I've got an unanswered question about the content, the make-up of the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2629)|
| 0:43:57| Do we want to remove those from consent and talk about those separately so we can approve the consent items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| Is there a motion that we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| Now let's go back to the consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| Do I have a motion that we approve those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| We'll move off 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| 802 is on page seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| It's constituting the Knox County Charter Review Committee and providing for the effective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2664)|
| 0:44:29| or ineffective date for appointments thereto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| And is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| Okay, discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| I know that we've, under the old way of looking at things, nine districts, nine commissioners would be on the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2680)|
| 0:44:50| Also, there would be nine appointments, assumedly one per district, by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2690)|
| 0:44:59| So we've got nine commissioners, nine citizens appointed by the commission per district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2699)|
| 0:45:06| My question, if I'm right so far, the third group of nine is appointed by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2706)|
| 0:45:18| Do they come from the nine districts is one of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| Sir, no, if I could, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| The charter merely reads, sir, that there will be nine registered voters of Knox County who are not members of the commission to be nominated by the county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2725)|
| 0:45:39| And that's the extent of the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| And it hasn't been interpreted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| So we really don't have any ancillary language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| And I guess where my question comes from, it says two citizens per district in another sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2748)|
| 0:45:53| Yes, it's incongruent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| And it also, of course, doesn't presume the fact, you know, and it's operating under the supposition that you had 19 and not 11 commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2754)|
| 0:46:01| That's the challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| And then it goes back to then the first make-up, nine commissioners, and we have 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2763)|
| 0:46:10| What are we going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Take nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| You're going to have nine commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| You need a total of 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| That's a total of 27, nine commissioners and then two citizens from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2778)|
| 0:46:31| Well, again, sir, that's already agreed that it's incongruent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| So I believe we need to know what the ground rules are going to be from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| No, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| I mean, we've discussed this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| It's problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| But I think the key is nine commissioners, then nine individuals appointed by the commission, then an additional nine nominated by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2803)|
| 0:46:54| Whether or not we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| And I'll say one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| And two of these citizens are from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2816)|
| 0:47:05| Yeah, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| It reads, again, not more than two such citizen members who are registered voters of Knox County shall be nominated from each commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2826)|
| 0:47:16| Not more than two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| So it basically has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| But let me say I will take my name out of the running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| So that means there's a pool of ten to be on the charter review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| Do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| Commissioner Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| I think that it may sound incongruent, but I think it's the way it's always been read in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2853)|
| 0:47:41| The way it sounds to me is that two citizens, not more than two from each district, pretty much says one that each commissioner gets to choose and one that the mayor gets to choose from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2861)|
| 0:47:53| And that's what I would prefer to go with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| And I hate to leave Commissioner Hammond and Commissioner Shouse out because I think this is an incredibly important committee that we're going to be putting together here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2878)|
| 0:48:07| But I don't believe there's any way that we can change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| Is there, Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| Because this is stated in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| I'm not looking for anything else to do, so I'm happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| Also, and this is completely off topic, but I wanted to alert you all that my daughters and I baked some sweet potato cheesecake for the holidays, which is on the table back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2899)|
| 0:48:31| Move we adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| With some homemade cinnamon whipped cream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| And it's available for any of the commissioners and anyone in the audience who would like to have some happy holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2916)|
| 0:48:42| Commissioner Orlandi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| I would ask to be removed or not be placed to serve on this committee only because I've only been here a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2924)|
| 0:48:52| I'd rather Ed Shouse serve since he's in my district and he has more knowledge on this than I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2932)|
| 0:48:59| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| So, therefore, we have our nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2942)|
| 0:49:03| He didn't agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| I was just about to say the same thing Chairman Hammond said about two minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| I'm sorry, sir, but you didn't make a contemporaneous objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| So you're serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| I would be happy to serve if Commissioner Orlandi defers to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2954)|
| 0:49:19| I'll be honored to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| So I guess the ground rules are we have our nine commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| There will be each commissioner will select from the nine districts one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| And then the mayor will select nine from one of the districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| Is that correct, from each of the districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| So I'm assuming that's kind of the ground rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| Mr. Rice, do you have anything you'd like to add to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| Hey, Dean Rice, 925 Mid-South Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| For clarification's sake, I believe Mr. Jarrett, am I correct in saying that the intent of the charter is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2986)|
| 0:49:53| that the mayor be required to appoint one per district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| I'm not saying that he's opposed to it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| But simply we have to go by what's in the charter, not what we may wish it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=2999)|
| 0:50:05| Not more than does not require two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| But it also says that there can be no more than two for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| No more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| That's the only way you can get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| And it could well be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| So we'll be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| Now, Mr. Jarrett, is that your understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| Just so that the mayor is clear in terms of going forward with the appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3022)|
| 0:50:28| It requires 27 total members to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| Obviously, the nine commission members are simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| They will then choose apparently one from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| It's that remaining nine that obviously is the sticking point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| And, again, it's, you know, part of it does read not more than two from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| But, again, it presupposes there's 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| In terms of whether or not we can say with certainty the mayor must pick nine or one from each of the nine districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3050)|
| 0:51:00| it's not that clear, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| That last nine I'd like to study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| I think right now the key is we've got our nine commission members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| The commissioners will pick nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| And then in terms of the remaining nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| I have yet been able to find any of the legislative discussion that led up to this, and I'd like to review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3073)|
| 0:51:20| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| I'm not making any kind of statement on the administration's behalf in terms of what the mayor wants to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| or doesn't want to do, but I want to leave it flexible enough to where you have the chance to study the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| Because if you take it as a whole paragraph and everything within it as one framework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| then I would assume each commissioner is also a citizen of their district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| So you would be getting to three by the nature of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| So there has to be some ambiguity in it, and I appreciate the law director clarifying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3103)|
| 0:51:49| Mr. Chairman, and this is not this is exactly in the direction of where I'm headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3109)|
| 0:51:55| It is not what I wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| What I want is for us to know the rules up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| So that it can be done correctly, not as I wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| Then I really think we need to delay this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| I would hate to vote on something that we don't have a full understanding on its implications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3133)|
| 0:52:20| and lock ourselves into something today that we'll end up having to unwind next month or the months coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3140)|
| 0:52:29| So I guess my question to the law director is, before I'm considering a substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3149)|
| 0:52:35| is what would be the downside of delaying this 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| Well, you really should move with this with all deliberate speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| I should be able to know with certainty whether or not really the mayor has to give you nine names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3164)|
| 0:52:50| regardless if they come from one from each district or there are multiple districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| I can, I think, clarify that pretty quickly, depending upon what we have in our legislative history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3175)|
| 0:53:01| But at this point, you've got nine commission members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| The commission should concentrate on getting their nominations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| and I'll work with the mayor's office in terms of his nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| Yeah, I mean, again, I would just like to get some clarity on whether the statement that Commissioner Reitzman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3190)|
| 0:53:20| has been focusing on is an accurate statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| I have some ambiguity on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| If it says no more than two, I think we're locked into the mayor having one in districts one through nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3206)|
| 0:53:32| and the commission having one in districts one through nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| I mean, it seems fairly straightforward, so I guess I'm just hesitant to move out and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3216)|
| 0:53:43| we get something strange and, you know, load up any district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3223)|
| 0:53:47| Who cares what district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| I just think the crafters of this, whether we're, you know, micromanaging it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3228)|
| 0:53:56| I think the point of it was to have nine commissioners in districts one through nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3236)|
| 0:54:02| and 18 commissioners, I mean 18 citizens, two each per district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3242)|
| 0:54:07| That's really the way it sounds to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| So this up and down and around, I'm just a little worried about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| I don't want to pass up the day and then we load up, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| first district has four names and here we are, you know, without a district being fairly represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3259)|
| 0:54:27| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3267)|
| 0:54:28| You know, I think I brought this up the last time because if I recall, you know, back in 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3268)|
| 0:54:34| we were going to have a charter review committee at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| And the mayor submitted his, you may remember this too, Sam, the mayor submitted his nine names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3277)|
| 0:54:43| And my understanding was, and I meant to bring the charter with me today, which I didn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| but my understanding was is that when the mayor submits his nine names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| the commission can either accept or reject those as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| And at that time we rejected the names that the mayor put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| We couldn't, we didn't vote on those individually, but it had to be voted on as a list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3301)|
| 0:55:06| And is that addressed there in the, but that's my recollection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| I don't know if anyone else that was there remembers that happening or not, but we, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| Well, actually the charter reads each nominee shall be voted on individually by the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3316)|
| 0:55:25| Each nominee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| So even the nine the mayor presents to you, you vote on each one individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3326)|
| 0:55:33| That's how the charter presently reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| Maybe what happened, we ran into an impasse with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| I don't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| Just, I think what happened, the way the mayor presented it to us was in like a, don't quote me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3338)|
| 0:55:45| like in the form of a resolution and all the names were tied together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| So we had to, I think all the names were somehow tied together to where it was an up and down vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3349)|
| 0:55:55| And I believe maybe also the day we voted on it, it was given to us just a few minutes before we, that may have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| maybe that's what I recall too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| I remember it was very controversial, but it was refused by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3362)|
| 0:56:08| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3371)|
| 0:56:12| And that's moving from the very front end of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3372)|
| 0:56:19| My other question is it's a very tail end of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| If this committee comes up with something that should be changed in the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3383)|
| 0:56:28| it is a statement or petition or whatever is addressed to the election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3388)|
| 0:56:40| Whatever that group comes up with, they make their presentation in the form of a petition to the election commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3400)|
| 0:56:50| placing something on the ballot to be approved by the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3410)|
| 0:56:55| What I would like to see, I think, is working from whatever election day backwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3415)|
| 0:57:01| we probably need some kind of calendar with some benchmarks on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| about when certain processes have to be complete and certain activities performed by either the group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3426)|
| 0:57:14| or whatever it takes to facilitate getting to whichever appropriate election date that might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3434)|
| 0:57:21| And I use those words, appropriate election date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| I don't know what that might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| So there are lots of things that need to be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| This is not one of those things we throw up in the air and it comes out okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| This is one that's going to take a considerable amount of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3453)|
| 0:57:39| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| I don't see any reason to delay for this reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| Number one, as has been enumerated two or three times, we have nine commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3464)|
| 0:57:51| We have nine appointed, one in each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| And then the mayor has nine appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| How he does that is not germane to the fact whether we go forward with this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| That's to be determined by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| So I'll call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3483)|
| 0:58:10| Yes, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| You called for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| Do you want us to vote on the call or do you want to withdraw the call to hear from the mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3492)|
| 0:58:18| I'll withdraw and listen to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| And also Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3500)|
| 0:58:21| So, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| You didn't say you'd do what the mayor asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| You said you'd just listen to him, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3505)|
| 0:58:26| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| Mr. Archett, County Mayor, 6401 Airtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3508)|
| 0:58:33| Just in the spirit of cooperation, why don't we just agree to pick one from each commission district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3513)|
| 0:58:40| if that's okay with commission and we can put this to rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| I believe we can find qualified people in each of our commission districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| And I'd be glad to do that if that will make things a little easier on you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| That's quite all right with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| We have nine commissioners, one citizen from each commission district selected by commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3537)|
| 0:59:02| nine persons selected by Mayor Burchett from each commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3542)|
| 0:59:07| The motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3547)|
| 0:59:08| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| No opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3552)|
| 0:59:13| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3553)|
| 0:59:14| I think that's your most legally defensive position, considering the way the language is in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| That's the best solution you can hope for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| First thing we'll do is we'll change that in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3560)|
| 0:59:26| Yes, the schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3567)|
| 0:59:28| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3568)|
| 0:59:29| Next item is resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| It's requesting that the chairman of the Knox County Commission forward a letter to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| Knox County Legislative Delegation requesting that the delegation petition the governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| to delay the closure of the Knox County based Lakeshore Mental Health Institute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| I believe I made the motion at the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| And I will make that motion now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3597)|
| 0:59:58| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3598)|
| 0:59:59| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3599)|
| 1:00:00| I would like to recuse myself because I have a wife and a sister-in-law that works there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| so that's why I will not participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| Did we change the we had an initial delay of the closing for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| Did we change the letter, the wording of the letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| What's exactly what the changes are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| Does somebody remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| We had asked that the letter be sent to the Speaker of the House, the Lieutenant Governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3619)|
| 1:00:26| Delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| The delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3627)|
| 1:00:28| Remember that we expanded the list of people that the letter would be sent to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| We also took out the two-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| Just delayed until the plan was presented was what it was, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| That's essentially what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| Delay until the plan was presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| Mr. Law Director, what does the resolution say exactly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3642)|
| 1:00:49| I give my copy away again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3652)|
| 1:00:53| I want to make sure we're correct on the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| I would like to, while we're looking for that, I'd like to make a couple of statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3656)|
| 1:01:00| One being that I truly appreciate the mayor getting on the cell phone and getting information to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3660)|
| 1:01:09| within a day or two about bringing more information to us, commission, here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3669)|
| 1:01:16| So I appreciate the mayor doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| I think I know a lot more about what's taking place than I knew before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3678)|
| 1:01:24| And then also a second thing, Ryan Haynes, State Legislature, visiting with us during your chairman's lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3684)|
| 1:01:33| I appreciate your making those arrangements because all I can say is that the more information we have to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3693)|
| 1:01:39| the more focused we can be on the fact that I believe my one statement about this was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3699)|
| 1:01:45| as the commissioner said he was kind of offended by this being all in the name of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3705)|
| 1:01:56| I likewise would want him to know that I think we in Knox County would be offended if this cost us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3716)|
| 1:02:05| So going from that point, whatever is contained in the resolution today about what we should do in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3725)|
| 1:02:12| I believe you're going to hit the highlights there in just a second, I'm in favor of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| The paragraph says that the chairman of the commission shall forward a letter to the Knox County Legislative Delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3737)|
| 1:02:22| requesting that the delegation petition the governor to delay the closure of the Knox County based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3742)|
| 1:02:28| Lakeshore Mental Health Institute and continue to accept patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| Does not say anything about a time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| It did say we request a meeting with the commissioner within the next 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| That meeting's already been held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| So in terms of whether it being a year or two years or whatever, that language was taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| And then should we remove the next 30 day language also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| I would suggest we do that since he's already met with us or had the opportunity to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3774)|
| 1:02:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| I don't have it today, but I'm in the process of getting some information that was given to me orally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3777)|
| 1:03:03| and I asked that it be given to me in writing so that I could impart it on to the rest of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3783)|
| 1:03:10| Right now there are waiting times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| We take somebody in right now, and J.J. could probably attest to this if he was still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3794)|
| 1:03:21| But in some of the cases when they come in to these three day holding patterns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3801)|
| 1:03:26| depending on the case, sometimes there are four to eight months wait before they can get into a program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3806)|
| 1:03:33| So that just shows the fact that we do need a facility where we can handle these type things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3813)|
| 1:03:41| And I'm not sure that, you know, this 16 bed thing is going to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| So I think we need to take another look at some of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| and go when we go to those committee meetings be armed with what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3828)|
| 1:03:54| We need to not just plan the next year or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| We need to plan the next ten, 20 years on this subject because it's not going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| In the luncheon, one thing that I did notice, and I was in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| I came in late and heard part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| And the thing that struck me the most was there was a fellow back there that I think maybe he's consulting with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3855)|
| 1:04:22| Helen Ross McNabb now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| It's Dr. Noe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| And I'd like for us to keep in mind Dr. Noe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| I mean, he's only spent his whole life on the homeless issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| And he is truly an authority and a treasure to this area because of his knowledge and experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3872)|
| 1:04:41| And in just chatting with him, I mean, he says there's a lot of things to consider here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3881)|
| 1:04:48| There are a lot of details to work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| When we start, what we don't want to do is not really address the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3891)|
| 1:05:00| And so this is a complicated affair, these crisis stabilization units, the shortage of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3900)|
| 1:05:09| I mean, all these things fit together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| There's a lot of pieces that have to fit together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| It's not just a safety center to solve the immediate problem of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3915)|
| 1:05:21| putting the mentally ill in jail or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| It's a comprehensive look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| And so I'd just like to remind us of that and remember Dr. Noe because he's an authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3927)|
| 1:05:36| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| Yeah, looking back on the resolution at the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| it says that we respectfully request that the plan for the closure be made available to the stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| Essentially, that's what I want to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| You know, Representative Haynes said there's a good opportunity that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3946)|
| 1:05:52| We just need to see the plan and what, because we're really, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3952)|
| 1:05:55| obviously we're out for the best of what's the patient's, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3955)|
| 1:06:01| But this affects our whole community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| and we need to make sure that the plan for our law enforcement and our providers is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| and we're not going to be looking for funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| My issue is more funding that the state may not do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| I'm more concerned about the money staying here than I am about asking them not to close it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3974)|
| 1:06:20| The money needs to be, if they do close it, they need to reinvest here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| and I think that needs to be part of our letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| So the motion on the floor is to approve taking out the section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| which would ask for the meeting within 30 days since he did come and meet with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| Yes, I do want to make a comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| and I'm a co-sponsor of this and everything that everyone has said has been very on point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=3998)|
| 1:06:46| And I appreciate everyone's concern over this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| but one of the things that I do want to address is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| and Commissioner Brown mentioned this, is capacity, current capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4014)|
| 1:06:58| We're not anywhere close to where we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| There's going to have to be, if we're going to move these into a more community-based mental health situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4021)|
| 1:07:06| we're talking about more group homes, more permanent supportive housing, more facilities of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4026)|
| 1:07:15| And I want a commitment from commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4035)|
| 1:07:22| And, of course, that's not part of this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| but I'm putting you all on notice right now that I want you all to be thinking about what part your district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4044)|
| 1:07:31| and your communities are going to do to help with this, because this is a community-wide problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4051)|
| 1:07:37| And there are parts of the county that are already over-saturated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| over-concentrated with group homes and halfway houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| And I'm looking for each commissioner that's part of this body to step up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| and their communities to step up and be part of the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4070)|
| 1:07:54| So we have a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4077)|
| 1:07:58| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4078)|
| 1:07:59| The motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| The next item is on page 8, resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| It's requesting that the chairman of the Knox County Commission forward a letter to the Knox County legislative delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4088)|
| 1:08:14| requesting that they oppose any changes to the Tennessee's Open Meetings Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4094)|
| 1:08:19| as applied to political subdivisions of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4099)|
| 1:08:23| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4103)|
| 1:08:24| I move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4104)|
| 1:08:25| There is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| Would I have my name added to this, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| We heard a couple hours ago from Chairman, or Chair of the Knox County Commission, Haynes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4111)|
| 1:08:36| that he thought there was, he speculated this item would not get out of committee in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4116)|
| 1:08:41| Nevertheless, I think it's a move forward for our body to show that we are comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4121)|
| 1:08:48| with the way the Sunshine Law was applied to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| I can see how it can be interpreted as onerous and creates inefficiencies and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4131)|
| 1:08:58| but if you view what happened in Knox County in January of 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| I think we just need to step forward and say let's be as transparent and let the sun shine as prolifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4142)|
| 1:09:09| as abundantly as possible, and I hope we can support this and move it on to our legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4149)|
| 1:09:18| I do not think it's, I think it would be a step backwards if we went along with constricting the sunshine provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4158)|
| 1:09:26| There is a pretty large article in the paper today that Ron Ramsey says he supports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4166)|
| 1:09:33| although he's evasive in his comments or he's fairly vague in his comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4173)|
| 1:09:38| but he supports the loosening of the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| I think it's about page five or six of the Sentinel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| and I just think it's important that we show where we stand on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4184)|
| 1:09:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4189)|
| 1:09:50| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4190)|
| 1:09:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| This is a double-edged sword that we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4193)|
| 1:09:58| I have absolutely no problem with the action that we're taking here at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4198)|
| 1:10:05| but I would like for us to look back at the restrictive action that commission took last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4205)|
| 1:10:13| and after last month's meeting, I left here and attended a meeting in halls to which actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4213)|
| 1:10:23| upon entering the door, I saw fellow commissioner Larry Smith there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| and I believe I made the comment that Knox County Commission, in its infinite wisdom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| has decided that two silent commissioners cannot sit in the same room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4232)|
| 1:10:39| Sandra Clark offered me a seat to sit beside her, but I said it was not a sunshine meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4239)|
| 1:10:46| That was November the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| November the 28th, and by way of what I'm doing right at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4248)|
| 1:10:52| is remedying meetings that I have attended in the last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4252)|
| 1:10:57| to which, inadvertently, I was in the presence of other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| November the 28th at the Presbyterian Church on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| November the 30th at India Kincannon's campaign kickoff, I left when Ed Schaust showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4267)|
| 1:11:14| December the 2nd, the city of Knoxville had a meeting on Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| December the 6th, Knoxville Convention Center had appreciation night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4279)|
| 1:11:23| to which I didn't know Commissioner Brown might attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4283)|
| 1:11:29| December the 8th, Northeast Knox Utility District employee appreciation lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| Ed Schaust goes to four or five things a day, so he was obviously there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| December the 12th at Ross Child's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| Larry Smith was there, but he was late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4303)|
| 1:11:47| December the 14th, Sheriff Jones had a get-together in the small room here behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4307)|
| 1:11:57| December the 15th, the East Tennessee Historical Society, of which I think I'm a member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| honored Governor Bill Haslam for being the East Tennessee Man of the Year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4322)|
| 1:12:08| for which he needs a round of applause, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| And December the 17th at the Jacob Building at Chilhowee Park, several commissioners were in attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4332)|
| 1:12:19| Now, some of these meetings may have been sunshined, but I do not know that many of them were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4339)|
| 1:12:27| One of the things that I've come across is paraphrasing something from Thomas Paine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4347)|
| 1:12:34| principles of our society, we unite and we advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| By comparison, government action often destroys that advancement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4359)|
| 1:12:44| Tennessee sunshine law is Tennessee Code Annotated 844-101-201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4364)|
| 1:12:50| General Assembly hereby declares it to be the policy of the state that the formation of public policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| and its decisions of public business shall not be conducted in secret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4375)|
| 1:13:04| Now, the state can restrict certain activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| We're under a prohibition not to vote on county business outside of sunshine meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4388)|
| 1:13:20| There have been other things that have made it all the way to the Supreme Court, U.S. v. J.C.'s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4400)|
| 1:13:27| U.S. v. Rotary Club, U.S. v. Ruotan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4407)|
| 1:13:35| In those cases, membership could occur but couldn't be trumped by denying membership to minorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4415)|
| 1:13:45| In other words, females needed to be members of the J.C.'s, the Ruotans, and the Rotary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4425)|
| 1:13:56| But the other side of the sword showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| You can't have discrimination, but the organization cannot be required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4439)|
| 1:14:07| must not be required to allow or promote a message that they don't want to promote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4447)|
| 1:14:13| In other words, they have a zone of privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4453)|
| 1:14:19| There can no longer be any doubt that freedom of association with others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4459)|
| 1:14:24| is for a common advancement of political beliefs and ideas as a form of orderly group activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4464)|
| 1:14:30| protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments that came out of Cusper v. Pointykes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4470)|
| 1:14:37| That's 414 of the U.S. 51, pages 56, 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4477)|
| 1:14:43| Speech is the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| I think that's what we're dealing with right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| The Fourteenth Amendment has in it the right to associate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4487)|
| 1:14:55| I believe that we here, we need to construct a framework of regulation to protect sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4495)|
| 1:15:03| That's what I said when I first started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| I have nothing against sunshine, and I believe, as Commissioner McKenzie may have said last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4505)|
| 1:15:14| we've come a long way in three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| We are not the commission to which the lawsuit addressed sunshine violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4516)|
| 1:15:23| We're the commission that meets in sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| We're the commission that when two commissioners want to talk, we sunshine it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4526)|
| 1:15:37| Some of the language, some of the quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| Here's a quote from Justice O'Connor in one of these rulings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| A predominantly expressive association has an absolute right to determine its own membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4543)|
| 1:15:51| Government attempts to regulate association as grounds for decision-making is chilling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4551)|
| 1:15:58| Whenever I look at the last sentence of the commission rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4558)|
| 1:16:04| when it speaks to commissioners need to provide the commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4564)|
| 1:16:10| with a list of those regularly scheduled meetings of civic, community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| and political organizations at which two or more commissioners may attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| to ensure that adequate public notice of same as given, I would tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4579)|
| 1:16:24| is in violation of our individual rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4584)|
| 1:16:30| And that if Amy wants to go to the Democrat, you can go to the Republican Club meeting if you want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4590)|
| 1:16:36| but if you want to go to the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| They wouldn't let me in the door, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| If you want to go to the Democrat Club meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4598)|
| 1:16:44| I don't believe that under the rulings that I've just cited that have come through the Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| that you have the right to require them to sunshine their meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| They have a right to associate with people of like-mindedness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| as long as they admit all people of that like-mindedness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4619)|
| 1:17:07| and that we, Knox County Commission, can't legislate it on those organizations to accept all points of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4627)|
| 1:17:15| It's here in clear black letter, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4635)|
| 1:17:19| The Section F that we approved last month starts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4639)|
| 1:17:25| any county commissioner desirous of meeting with fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4645)|
| 1:17:32| that's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| We're not talking about me sitting in the Presbyterian Church with Brown's wife and my wife separating us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4654)|
| 1:17:43| I believe that even the law directors have found that these are chance meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4663)|
| 1:17:49| They're scheduled meetings, else I wouldn't have known some of these were going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4669)|
| 1:17:55| I think that the last sentence of the Section 7 or whatever it is, Paragraph 7, Section F,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4675)|
| 1:18:06| the last sentence, someone's going to have to work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| I believe it needs to disappear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for letting me run way over 40 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4692)|
| 1:18:17| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| It wasn't 40, but the clock did stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4700)|
| 1:18:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| You know, this is, again, this is Groundhog Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| We just kind of keep trampling over the same ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4713)|
| 1:18:40| No one up here has lost more votes than I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| But when you're on the minority side of a vote, you take your lump, you really think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| You really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| When I vote, I really think that my side of the vote is the correct side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| But to keep bringing it back before us and talk about it and talk about it, I think is counterproductive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4736)|
| 1:19:05| And it's counterproductive in that I really don't know what side of the ordinance folks are on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4745)|
| 1:19:13| I mean, I'm tending to say from what I just heard that we don't need to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4753)|
| 1:19:19| and we need to get with Senator Ramsey and go ahead and water down the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4759)|
| 1:19:26| Because you can't tell me, you can't, you cannot tell me that a Democratic Club meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4766)|
| 1:19:34| and a Republican Club meeting, you don't talk politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4774)|
| 1:19:38| Why in the world do they have an organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| if you're not going to talk politics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| There's nothing else to talk about as far as being a Republican.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4783)|
| 1:19:48| The whole point of being a Republican, the whole point of being a Democrat is political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| That's all it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4793)|
| 1:19:54| It's a political party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4794)|
| 1:19:57| So then to say that we shouldn't sunshine those, I think is counterproductive to this resolution that we're sending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4797)|
| 1:20:07| and what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4807)|
| 1:20:08| What we've said is that what we passed last month is that things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4808)|
| 1:20:12| you know, a groundbreaking of a bank in your community or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4812)|
| 1:20:17| you're not going to talk politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| If there's a groundbreaking of a county facility, you may talk politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4819)|
| 1:20:25| I really don't think this is a difficult thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4825)|
| 1:20:28| It may be distasteful for some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| It may be a bitter pill to swallow for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4830)|
| 1:20:34| But, you know, at the end of the day, do we want transparency or do we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4834)|
| 1:20:39| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| I mean, you know, and they'll come up with another one to become even more transparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| take even more of the tin out of the glass, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| But we're on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4848)|
| 1:20:52| We put ourselves on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| I've tried to say that I think we've gone far enough, but we keep introducing legislations like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4854)|
| 1:21:01| which I'm going to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| I'll support the next one, too, and I'll support the one that says we all turn in our meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| because this is going to be a never-ending process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| When do we get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4873)|
| 1:21:14| When do we get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4876)|
| 1:21:17| This is self-imposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| You know, no one's forcing us to turn in anything to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4879)|
| 1:21:24| The state hands down things to us that we don't deal with because we're chartered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4884)|
| 1:21:30| We just, you know, have counter legislation to undo that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| So, you know, as we look at these attempts, and I think it's more of an attempt for the community to gain public trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4895)|
| 1:21:48| I honestly think that's what it's all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| But at some point we're going to have to draw a line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| Again, I'm going to support this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| I don't know what side folks are on, because it sounds like if you don't want to turn in all of your meetings that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4917)|
| 1:22:04| political in nature, where you might stand up or you might talk to someone and another politician on this body hears us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4924)|
| 1:22:12| then, you know, we're probably being a little disingenuous to our attempt to become totally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4932)|
| 1:22:19| and completely transparent to a potential chance deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| And it's not a chance meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4944)|
| 1:22:25| I can meet any one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4945)|
| 1:22:26| We can talk basketball, whether Central's going to beat Austin East, or Carter's going to beat Austin East,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| or Powell's going to beat, you know, Austin East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| But, you know, from a district-to-district kind of friendly competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| But, you know, if there's anything more than that from a political nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| then we may find ourselves on the underside of not having a sunshine meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4961)|
| 1:22:47| So I'm going to stop while I see yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| Commissioner Burrells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| A couple of things I wanted to bring up that might help with this situation is that I think the key to that sentence is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4973)|
| 1:23:03| regularly scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| Somebody's retirement party or a groundbreaking or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4986)|
| 1:23:12| that's not a regularly scheduled community or political meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| And I think when we discussed this last month, we were pretty clear about what kind of meetings we were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=4995)|
| 1:23:21| And those organizations do not at the burden is not on them to sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5001)|
| 1:23:28| The burden is on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| And I have had no problem whatsoever sending a list of meetings that I might be at or that I'm planning to be at to Jolie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5010)|
| 1:23:40| It's going to be even easier on the first after we get this set up where we can do it ourselves at any time of the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5020)|
| 1:23:47| or night, as long as it's before 48 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5027)|
| 1:23:51| So I hope that that helps alleviate some of the stress that there seems to be floating around about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5031)|
| 1:24:00| And actually, to mark on something that Sam said, no, we are not the same commission that was here three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5040)|
| 1:24:10| We do not conduct our meetings in secret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| This probably shouldn't even come up to begin with, but it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| And if we're going to do it, guys, we should do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5057)|
| 1:24:25| Yeah, I'm I'm for this resolution because I don't want to water it down the state law of the sunshine law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5065)|
| 1:24:36| But I'm not for muddying it up either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| And I said it last month when we voted on this that we're asking ourselves to sunshine a meeting that we have no control over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5079)|
| 1:24:50| the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5090)|
| 1:24:51| We have no control over who's going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| We have no control over what they're going to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5093)|
| 1:24:59| I didn't attend the West Knox Council meeting this past couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5099)|
| 1:25:04| And then I was chastised in the paper for not showing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| Well, I couldn't show up because I found out that day that Commissioner Norman was going to be speaking on the Hill and Ridge top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5108)|
| 1:25:16| Well, I can't attend because it wasn't sunshine and I didn't get 48 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5116)|
| 1:25:21| So then I'm chastised for not showing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5121)|
| 1:25:25| So I think that and I said it last month, we're going down a slippery slope when we start adding this stuff in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5125)|
| 1:25:33| I cannot sunshine something that is not and not everything discussed in every political meeting, Republican Club meeting, is political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5133)|
| 1:25:41| We talk about various things, scholarships to be offered, fundraisers to raise money for scholarships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5141)|
| 1:25:49| We talk about different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5149)|
| 1:25:53| I just think that we're going down a very slippery slope when we continue to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5153)|
| 1:25:57| Now, we voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5157)|
| 1:25:58| It passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5158)|
| 1:25:59| There's nothing I can do about it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| So I just I will support this because I don't think that we need to do water this down because I think it is a good law and that we need to abide by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5161)|
| 1:26:12| And I'm not I don't talk to any commissioner when I go to any of these meetings other than say hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5172)|
| 1:26:19| I don't sit here and talk about the weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| I don't talk about football.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5181)|
| 1:26:22| I sit at my own little table and I listen to what's happening and listen to what the constituents have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5182)|
| 1:26:30| When you sunshine something, especially a club like Commissioner Wright was saying, you're taking away their rights to have their own meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5190)|
| 1:26:41| And, I mean, Democrats can't come into a Republican Club meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5201)|
| 1:26:46| I mean, they can come, but chances are they're not going to let them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5206)|
| 1:26:51| They don't want to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| Well, they may not want to stay either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| But I'm just saying, I mean, we're asking ourselves to sunshine something we have no control over, the agenda or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5215)|
| 1:27:02| I'm not the president of one of these clubs or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| So but that's neither been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| The one that's on the books is do we want to water down what's already on the walls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| And I say no, that we leave it the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5235)|
| 1:27:16| Very quickly, I think we're, you know, we're losing the forest for the trees here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5236)|
| 1:27:22| It was very clear, I think, both the intent and the letter of the law at the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5242)|
| 1:27:27| and in the ruling the chancellery court had is that there's nothing wrong on going to meetings where people are at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| There's nothing wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5252)|
| 1:27:33| And they quoted a bunch of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| They quoted this in the court ruling, that we could talk about football or vacations, what our nieces and nephews were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5255)|
| 1:27:42| There's nothing wrong with talking politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| What we can't do without noticing the meetings is to deliberate on issues that are going to be voted on at this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5265)|
| 1:27:54| And I think that's what's very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| A basketball game at UT is a scheduled event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5276)|
| 1:28:01| But I just don't think that because Larry Smith shows up there, I have to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5281)|
| 1:28:05| And, again, what is the intent and the letter of the law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| What the intent and the letter is and what we should not be doing is getting together in an unnoticed situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5288)|
| 1:28:16| where we're discussing issues that are going to be voted on before this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5296)|
| 1:28:21| To me, it's as simple as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| It doesn't mean we can't go there and talk about who's going to win the Republican nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5303)|
| 1:28:28| We can't talk about what Republicans are going to do to defeat Obama or what's going to happen in the state Senate race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5308)|
| 1:28:35| But what we can't do is talk about an issue that's on the agenda to be voted on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5315)|
| 1:28:40| And, to me, that's what this is all about, not whether we're there together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5320)|
| 1:28:46| And I think if we keep it as simple as that, then when we run into people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5326)|
| 1:28:50| and I don't have any problem with talking to Larry Smith about how UT basketball program is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5330)|
| 1:28:57| I've talked to Mike Hammond about how Coach Dooley is to meet this intense guy in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5337)|
| 1:29:03| I don't think there's anything wrong with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| But what we can't do is talk about things we're going to vote on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5345)|
| 1:29:09| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5351)|
| 1:29:15| Last Monday at our workshop, I was a lone vote against this because of what we did last month at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5355)|
| 1:29:24| Mr. Wright just read you off a list of about a dozen meetings since last month's meeting that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5364)|
| 1:29:31| and I'm not an attorney, but attorneys have opined that none of those violate the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5371)|
| 1:29:37| We operate under the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| Last month, and Commissioner Ormby said we don't need to muddy the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5379)|
| 1:29:43| Last month, we muddied the waters, greatly muddied the waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5383)|
| 1:29:48| You could, you know, you could throw the baby out with the bath water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5388)|
| 1:29:53| But we need to take another look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| because I am not going to call a newspaper or a TV station every time I want to go to a freaking meeting like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5395)|
| 1:30:02| That's just not going to happen, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| There may be some concern here that I might not support this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5410)|
| 1:30:15| I am totally in support of the state, at the state level, not changing the sunshine law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5415)|
| 1:30:25| Although if you saw the Sunday morning program, one of the political talk programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5425)|
| 1:30:34| actual question came up with state legislators about sunshine and will this see the light of day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5434)|
| 1:30:43| And it was their belief that it will probably get into committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| I believe we even heard it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| This may get into committee, but it will never get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| I do not look for a change in the sunshine law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| I totally support what we have here before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| The thing that bothers me is the fact that the state has put a requirement on us that we sunshine when we deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5460)|
| 1:31:12| We do not decide in private or in secrecy is the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5472)|
| 1:31:17| I read the words to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5477)|
| 1:31:18| It's very short and simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5478)|
| 1:31:22| I also read you some Supreme Court cases that found in the favor of the groups that they have a right to expect like-mindedness in the people that attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5482)|
| 1:31:35| as long as you do not discriminate on race, creed, color, religion, national origin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5495)|
| 1:31:43| We have no control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| We, Knox County Commission, have no control over the rules and bylaws of the Democrat Party, the Republican Party, the Ruatan Club, or the Jaycees, or any of these other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5505)|
| 1:32:00| and I don't want to say social clubs, but that's what the Supreme Court said, clubs have the right to determine their membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5520)|
| 1:32:12| Now, I'm covered by two rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| If I go to the Ruatan Club, of which I'm a member, I go by their rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5536)|
| 1:32:23| I think like they think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5543)|
| 1:32:28| That's one kind of hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| That is one hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| I also wear another hat because citizens of the 8th District elected me to sit here on this Knox County Commission, a different kind of commission membership make-up than it was a few years back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5552)|
| 1:32:46| Now, I know the difference between discussion and deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5566)|
| 1:32:52| There are two very lengthy documents that we have to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| The judges said that school board and city council have no trouble finding the difference between discussion and deliberation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5577)|
| 1:33:06| but Knox County Commission had that problem at one time, and we've been admonished to do things to a higher standard, and we do it individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5586)|
| 1:33:15| In other words, we don't go to the Ruatan Club or the Democrat Club or the Republican Club and sit with other commissioners and deliberate Knox County business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5595)|
| 1:33:27| So the requirements that we have in front of us as a rule right now, I believe that the law director is opined upon, are chance meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5607)|
| 1:33:40| Not in this particular setting or form because I did not prevail in my vote last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5620)|
| 1:33:52| I would look forward to commission really taking the word of the law director about how we foster upon organizations in Knox County what its membership should think and believe and how it should react.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5632)|
| 1:34:08| And let me say it one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| I'm under two sets of rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| I abide by the rules of the organization I belong to, and I abide by state law in not deliberating anything that comes before county commission at any of those social club meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5653)|
| 1:34:29| And I am in favor of the resolution that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5669)|
| 1:34:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5672)|
| 1:34:33| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| Yes, I'm just going to say that I find this entire discussion incredibly patronizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5675)|
| 1:34:42| I think we have made a very clear distinction between chance meetings and regularly scheduled meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5682)|
| 1:34:48| There's nothing in what we passed last month that requires us to sunshine chance meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5688)|
| 1:34:56| No one's asking you to call the newspapers or the radio stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5696)|
| 1:35:03| And what we're discussing has absolutely nothing to do with the resolution that's on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5703)|
| 1:35:09| As Sam has pointed out, he and I would probably contest him for whoever's been on the losing end most often on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5709)|
| 1:35:19| I think I could give him a run for his money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5719)|
| 1:35:23| But we don't come back the next month and use a different resolution to expound upon while we think the rest of the body was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5723)|
| 1:35:34| Now, we need to vote on this resolution that's in front of us and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5734)|
| 1:35:41| The motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5743)|
| 1:35:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5744)|
| 1:35:45| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5745)|
| 1:35:46| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5746)|
| 1:35:47| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5747)|
| 1:35:48| The next item is the ordinance on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| No, it's O-11-11-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5751)|
| 1:35:55| It is amending Chapter 4 of Knox County Code entitled Alcoholic Beverages to, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5755)|
| 1:36:00| requiring Section 4-4 that the County Code Administration Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5760)|
| 1:36:04| in addition to the County Fire Marshal and County Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5764)|
| 1:36:08| also inspect and approve the location where beer is to be sold within 15 days of the beer permit application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5768)|
| 1:36:14| and, number two, to remove the county beer inspector from the requirements of Sections 4-4 and 4-36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5774)|
| 1:36:21| This amends Ordinance O-00-11-101 adopted December 18, 2000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5781)|
| 1:36:28| and it amends Ordinance O-09-3-107 adopted April 27, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5788)|
| 1:36:35| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5795)|
| 1:36:36| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5796)|
| 1:36:37| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5797)|
| 1:36:38| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5798)|
| 1:36:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5799)|
| 1:36:40| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5800)|
| 1:36:41| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5801)|
| 1:36:45| We had an added item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| The added item was discussion regarding the calendar for the 2012 meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5806)|
| 1:36:51| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| Yes, it was to approve the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| I passed this out in our workshop today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| I thought it would be helpful for us just to go ahead and have the calendar for the whole year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5816)|
| 1:37:01| You'll notice that in November and December of next year we've moved it up to the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| and third Mondays, which is what we normally do, but we just go ahead and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5825)|
| 1:37:10| The other thing is the reorganization is set for August the 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5830)|
| 1:37:16| Since September the 1st is set as a Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5836)|
| 1:37:22| and that will be the time where you will select a new chair, vice chair, and committee assignments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| Also, the town of Farragut has asked that we come back and do a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5846)|
| 1:37:31| We've tentatively scheduled that for March 19th, which will be our work session, not our regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5851)|
| 1:37:36| So I just brought this out thinking it would be helpful to go ahead and have this on our list of calendars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5856)|
| 1:37:40| and really nothing changes except the November and December and the special session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5860)|
| 1:37:44| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5864)|
| 1:37:45| Yes, I came in late, so I didn't get a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5865)|
| 1:37:49| I haven't had a chance to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5869)|
| 1:37:50| But one thing I do want to bring up that's been an issue in past years is that when NACO has its annual conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5870)|
| 1:38:00| which our commission chair and one other member of the commission is required by our rules to attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5880)|
| 1:38:05| and this is not the legislative conference, this is their annual conference, which usually takes place in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5885)|
| 1:38:11| it's usually the same week or the same Monday as our regular commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5891)|
| 1:38:16| And so I would like to look at moving our commission dates for that particular month so that it doesn't conflict with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5896)|
| 1:38:24| because we do by our commission rules require our commission chair and one other member of this body to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5904)|
| 1:38:30| So that creates a conflict for us to be able to do the county's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| They need to move their conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5914)|
| 1:38:35| They do need to move their conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| If we could, if we could go ahead and approve this, then we can come back and amend July if that's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5917)|
| 1:38:43| Is there a motion that we approve this calendar for next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5925)|
| 1:38:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5926)|
| 1:38:47| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| It is adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5930)|
| 1:38:51| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5931)|
| 1:38:52| Yes, one quick announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| And although I did bring cheesecake and peppermint bark for everybody to enjoy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5934)|
| 1:38:59| as we're looking towards setting our goals and resolutions for the new year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5939)|
| 1:39:04| Commissioner Wright and I are already in training for the run for the schools in the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5944)|
| 1:39:10| And we would like for as many other commissioners to take part in that as possible and get started now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5950)|
| 1:39:18| It's actually three runs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| It's the run for the schools, run for the deaf, and run for autism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5960)|
| 1:39:27| So you've got to run three races, Ms. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5967)|
| 1:39:32| If there's no other business to come before us, we will be adjourned until 6 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5972)|
| 1:39:37| and at 6 p.m. we will come back for our zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| So thank you, and we'll see you back at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5980)|
| 1:39:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part1?start=5998)|
