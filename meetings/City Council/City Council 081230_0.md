| 0:03:27| Very brief Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| Two issues or two things to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| Christmas in the City has had a great year this year, and I thank all the members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| I know a lot of you all have been at multiple events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| But we're not quite done with the holiday season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| The ice skating is going to continue until January 4th, and they've had a record year down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=220)|
| 0:03:44| and thanks for helping on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=224)|
| 0:03:46| But tomorrow night, December 31st, is First Night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| It'll be a great celebration all through downtown, lots of entertainment, some family entertainment as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| Unless I'm mistaken, I think they have a â€“ this is what I've always dreamed of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| They have an early New Year's for the children, and this works for some of us too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| I think at 9 o'clock they're going to have a little mini ball drop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| and some fireworks are going to go off for those of us who never can make it to midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| So that's going to happen at 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| I think it's at 9, and then at midnight there'll be another New Year's celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| But all throughout downtown, a lot of entertainment venues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=255)|
| 0:04:17| I really think it's going to be a special night and encourage everyone to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| There's musicians and storytellers and dance groups and puppeteers and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=260)|
| 0:04:25| The second thing is this is a historical meeting, I think you all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=265)|
| 0:04:28| This is our last meeting of 2008, and it's been a good year in a lot of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| But it's even more historical than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=273)|
| 0:04:35| For the last 20-something years, the city recorder has been sitting here faithfully recording messages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=275)|
| 0:04:42| But always in the past, the city recorder has been under the age of 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| But this is the last time that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| Oh, that was nice to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| And I just thought it was really us, but we need to mark that Cindy Abbott Mitchell will sometime soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=295)|
| 0:05:01| before our next meeting, celebrate her 50th birthday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| and we want to make certain that we celebrate that in a grand fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| Happy birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=310)|
| 0:05:16| I can't do that because I'm older than she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| You better hope she has to go through security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=322)|

| 0:06:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| I want to thank all of the individuals who have actually volunteered to be a part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| We actually had another council member, Council Member Becker, who also volunteered his services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| but said he's going to attend anyway and that there are other council members who wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=385)|

| 0:06:35| I guess just a question I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=395)|
| 0:06:36| Ultimately, and maybe one of the council members can bring this back, ultimately, whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| recommendation or whatever standards that come up, will they be coming back to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| council for us to take a look at and approve, is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| If not, I would request that that be done because I don't want, just because we've appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| a committee of people from city council, from county commission, and from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| that they have, I guess, our automatic ratification of whatever it is they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| I would like to be able to take a look at that to make sure that I'm very comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=422)|

| 0:09:59| in the writing of ordinances that we all follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=599)|

| 0:10:07| to beginning implementation of an ordinance that will aid all neighborhoods in their revitalization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=607)|

| 0:10:58| Jim Blattner, 3819 Glenfield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| Mr. Mayor, first of all, I'd like to say that you stole Cindy from UT, and we've never forgiven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=660)|
| 0:11:09| the city for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| She was a great employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| She worked for us for a number of years there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| I think Mr. Manning cried today when she left, which for him is a rarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=675)|
| 0:11:21| I'd like to clear up one point that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| There was one minor wording change that we had talked about, and after discussions today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| with Mr. King and Mr. Norman and Ms. Cash, we're comfortable with the wording as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| so we do not anticipate any wording changes on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| Again, I would like to thank everybody for the work that you all put in and, again, for trusting us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=699)|
| 0:11:46| I want to emphasize again that we do want to be able to be involved in the evaluation process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=706)|
| 0:11:51| because we will be able to give you the feedback from the other side of the coin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| You'll have excellent feedback, I'm sure, from your city employees on how that works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| from their aspect, but you do need the input of the neighborhoods to know how it's working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| from theirs, and hopefully we can do at that point in time, just as we have done with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| ordinance and move forward with some changes and good cooperation so that it works well for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=730)|
| 0:12:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| I'm signed up to speak against our first is Mr. Harold Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=740)|
| 0:12:30| Okay, Mr. Kline, would you like me to have somebody go in front of you and you can be second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| Mr. McCall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=754)|
| 0:12:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=761)|
| 0:13:04| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| Thank you, Mayor Haslund, members of city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| For the record, I'm Boyce McCall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| I have been in the city of Knoxville all my life, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=795)|
| 0:13:22| I would like to make this observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| It's not within this packet of information I want to give to you, but I want to apprise you of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=806)|
| 0:13:33| This city council, these members, probably violated the state and federal and city election laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=813)|
| 0:13:44| They leave the appearance of being one of those deals where I'll elect you, I'll vote for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=824)|
| 0:13:57| and after you get in there, then you pass this particular ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=837)|
| 0:14:04| Now, I haven't gotten all the details that I will have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| I'll go to the election commission and I'll find out just how closely these people have worked to violate our federal civil rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=847)|
| 0:14:19| We have an obligation to require these people at election time not to go out here and be soliciting these votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=859)|
| 0:14:29| They've got a lot of people that I know who will begin to probably, if we ask, give affidavits as to their persuasion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=869)|
| 0:14:41| by getting into these closed churches and in these enclosed houses and coming up with this type of an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=881)|
| 0:14:50| Now, you know Metropolitan Planning Commission, they voted against you 14 to 0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=890)|
| 0:14:58| You couldn't even get this honorable body to make a recommendation because they knew that it was wrong doing what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=898)|
| 0:15:08| Now then, getting to the ordinance itself, I have the introduction and I've got the index,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=908)|
| 0:15:17| and I've got seven different documents that I want to make to the record, put into the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=917)|
| 0:15:27| and I will give you those in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| And I won't go through them all because you probably already have known and have had some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=931)|
| 0:15:39| One of them, the first document, is a city ordinance in and of itself that you provided to me December 1908 through the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=939)|
| 0:15:53| And Ms. Mitchell is a wonderful person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| She's an absolute jewel for this city government because I never saw anybody in this government in all the years I've been coming here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=955)|
| 0:16:07| that can equal her integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| And I'm not saying that to brush nobody up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| I'm saying it because it's the absolute truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| She's the only fair employee I've ever seen in this city government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| in all the years I've been involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| Now go to exhibit number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| It's a letter from Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| She said, and I'm just going to paraphrase, she says that we're sending this ordinance back to Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=992)|
| 0:16:43| so they can protect the neighborhood group over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| And then to be fair, as she could be, with my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1008)|
| 0:16:55| And then I think last two weeks ago she voted against MPC, the very body she said would give us justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1015)|
| 0:17:05| And I want that as number two exhibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| And I have tapes of council workshop and the council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1028)|
| 0:17:14| And I want to make these exhibit three by the tapes incorporating by reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1034)|
| 0:17:26| I'm not going to give those to you, but I'm just wanting to make reference to them so that they get into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1046)|
| 0:17:32| Now then, I have this exhibit number four, Letter from Boyce McCall to the City Council dated October 29, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1052)|
| 0:17:46| And I go into several issues there, and I want those into this record as they are addressed to each individual council person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1066)|
| 0:17:59| Now then, I have exhibit five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| I have the Knoxville-Knox County Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| I have them listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| And I have a short biography of their expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1092)|
| 0:18:19| And they're the ones who voted not to honor your particular request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1099)|
| 0:18:28| Now then, number six, the MPC minutes of November 13, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1108)|
| 0:18:38| Now, she paraphrases much of what's said at this particular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1118)|
| 0:18:45| And I'm in there making my petition to them as well as these people back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1125)|
| 0:18:55| And I want that specifically noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| And then article number seven, there's a new Sentinel editorial written December 30, 2008 at section B2 in the editorial page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1139)|
| 0:19:19| And I want to make it noted that the new Sentinel has a conflict of interest, a serious conflict of interest in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1159)|
| 0:19:31| And also, I've got an asterisk up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| And I designate that as 7A, a Knoxville Journal edition, an article where the new Sentinel alleged that I attacked someone up there in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1175)|
| 0:19:57| 30 more seconds, Mr. McCall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| How many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| 30 more seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| Now then, Exhibit A is excerpts from the United States Constitution, Article 4, Section 4, and Amendment 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1203)|
| 0:20:22| I want that as an exhibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| Now, number nine, excerpts from the official police manual, City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1225)|
| 0:20:33| I will attach that, and I want that also to be the ninth and final exhibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1233)|
| 0:20:43| And I want to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| And I'd like to introduce these to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| And I can't walk up there, but I wish one of you would get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| We will get that from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| I just want to get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| Mr. King will get that from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| Thank you, Mr. McCall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1256)|
| 0:21:20| Mr. Kline, if you'd give us your name and address, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| I'm Harold Kline, 3143 Williams Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| I came here tonight because I've said this is probably the last time I'm going to be here to speak with you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1287)|
| 0:21:34| Back in 1963, I made a speech, A Pure Democracy is Natural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| It requires that all opinions be heard before a certain decision is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| It's freedom from fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| This artist that's been developed in Knoxville, I've been dealing with this kind of situation about 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1304)|
| 0:21:52| Actually, I didn't realize that these things were happening because I've probably been in and out of town a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1312)|
| 0:22:01| but I've made a note to check with about 300 to 400 people over the last few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1321)|
| 0:22:08| and talked to them about certain issues like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| And in the last two weeks, two or three days, I've probably 60 or 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1330)|
| 0:22:17| Now, I'm very upset in a way, not like you think, because I think that we should have a better understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1337)|
| 0:22:24| that when it produces hate crimes, unconstitutional issues, and I'll make this part of the record, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1344)|
| 0:22:32| It conspiracies, invades the privacy, and breaks the bond between the city, government, and the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1352)|
| 0:22:45| Now, as you know, I've got probably several hundred people that back me a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| I've been on Magnolia 44 years, so everybody in East Knoxville must know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1370)|
| 0:22:57| I've talked to a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| They don't know nothing about this issue right here, and I'm really ashamed and disappointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| that people on this podium up here would not take one half or one percent of the people doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1384)|
| 0:23:11| and make a decision for 99.5 percent of the whole total people of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| It's really not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| Barbara Pillow saying the artists will be complaint-driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| You mean somebody don't like me, don't have no interest in me, maybe a racist, maybe evil, disgruntled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1403)|
| 0:23:34| is going to call the city and set me up for failure after 65 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| Now, I'm going to tell you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| You may sign this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| You may put it into play, but it's going to be a long, rough, and rocky road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| I make a commitment tonight to all of you guys that I close everything down I got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| and make this a special case to follow it until something is done about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1432)|
| 0:23:58| because I think that, and I think we'll be influenced between 830 and 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1438)|
| 0:24:05| I've called people on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| I've got nobody between those hours, which means they're exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| They're exempt from that scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| People who are retired, fixed income, and poor people will be the victim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| Not on my watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| Not on my watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| Martin Luther King, I marched with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| He said one day, I looked down at the top of the mountain, and I see the promised land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1466)|
| 0:24:34| And I see a troubled land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| I see a troubled people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| And the thing about it is I represent a lot of people in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| And this 200 feet, taking a tape measure and coming to my yard and measuring my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1483)|
| 0:24:49| would never happen on my watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| If I had to take it to the end of the world, I promise you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| whatever it takes, how much money it takes, how many trips I take to Washington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| it would never happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| This is against my Constitution of the United States of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| Now you think my grandparents had these slave trains around their neck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| And I promise you, everybody on this stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| they'll never be attached to my legs or my people's legs anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| Never again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| Never again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| It's not right to put people under scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1517)|
| 0:25:25| You have to understand that everybody has a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| If an artist was not accepted or disabled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| typically we're at Low Dunlop to make two miles of the stadium around Cherry Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1534)|
| 0:25:42| Right there at Cherry Park where you say you don't have no vests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| have a gun show in a gun zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| They're having a car show where our people are trying to build cars to show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1549)|
| 0:25:56| and they put them out in the yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| Now I tell you, I travel around the state off to Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| Why can other people have cars to show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| and they put them out in the yard so we can't have nothing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| It'll never happen again on my watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| I refuse, I refuse to let that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| And I can get you many, many cases, many, many pictures of things happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1574)|
| 0:26:20| where that's happening all throughout our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| And you think that some people don't pay attention to the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| I worked for the federal government for 34 years and had its ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| I pay close attention to the details because I know what it takes to make things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| And I think right now I'm going to close in saying that if these issues that I just mentioned is not looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1594)|
| 0:26:47| I think we should table it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| I think we should let the Hispanics and Afro-Americans be a part of the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| They're not right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| They're excluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| There might be one or two, about 29,000 in East Nassau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| They need to be included too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| If you don't include them, I think that what's going to happen in the next few weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| for all to show and to come, will be a class action lawsuit, federal lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1626)|
| 0:27:13| I don't think it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| I think it will be a federal lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| I want the Justice Department and the Department of Interior to come in here and look at these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| Twenty more seconds, Mr. Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| There will be boycotts and demonstrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| There will be well-known professional people and politicians that I know that will come and help us with this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| We've got to get to the basis of this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| And I'm asking you right now, would you table it for two or three weeks to get the Afro-Americans and the Hispanics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| and the poor people to look at some of these things because they've got a voice in this thing too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| If you don't do that, and I want to tell you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| I'm very serious about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| If this doesn't happen, God have mercy on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| God have mercy on you because I thought that the city council members up there would never do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1673)|
| 0:28:00| I thought you would take their answer without doing this, but you didn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| Now, I'm telling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| That's your time, Mr. Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| I'll see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| If it's not tabled, I'll see you shortly after this meeting is over in a different atmosphere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1688)|
| 0:28:14| But I hope you table it and give us the opportunity to reconstruct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1694)|
| 0:28:21| Thank you, Mr. Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| Mr. Hatton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1703)|
| 0:28:33| John Hatton, 2315 Monterey Road here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| Some of you are looking at each other and saying, oh, God, speedy's back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| Saul Alinsky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| You've probably heard of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| He's a Russian, author of many books, political activist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1728)|
| 0:28:55| He was a socialist, and he was proud to tell anybody who would listen to him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| that he was a card-carrying member of the Communist Party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| With his radical values, he said that the personal rights of a few was above the property rights of the masses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1746)|
| 0:29:18| and that's what he made his career on, starting small groups and causing trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1758)|
| 0:29:26| Having said that, I'm going to ask you these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| I know you're not going to answer them because protocol doesn't allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| But what right have a few unelected people have to make the rules on thousands of property owners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1772)|
| 0:29:49| How much time has been spent on a rule to please a few elitist people that live in the high-rent area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1789)|
| 0:30:00| And can you not see, people, can you not see that this is the seeds of Big Brother?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1800)|
| 0:30:10| Can you not see that this is going to spread to bigger things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1810)|
| 0:30:16| How much money has been spent to please just a few people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1816)|
| 0:30:23| and ignore the masses of people who drive automobiles and own property in the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1823)|
| 0:30:34| My last question is, after hearing these questions and the quote of Saul Alinsky, a known communist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1834)|
| 0:30:48| and you're still going to vote for this, I have one last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| Have you no shame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| Those who are in favor, if anyone wants to, has a two-minute time for rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| If anybody wants to, by our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| I'm not seeing anyone move that way, so we'll go on to council discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1867)|
| 0:31:14| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| Well, I'm going to be voting against this, as I did the last time, because I just feel like it's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1876)|
| 0:31:23| I think a new catchphrase that's being tossed around is because it enhances property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1883)|
| 0:31:32| That sort of reminds me, and I'm all for people making profit and their property going up in value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| But it seems to me that we're beginning to use that as a catchphrase like some forms of government use for education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1898)|
| 0:31:46| It's for the children to put you on the spot to where you feel obligated to have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| I mean, I think this ordinance has all kinds of ways it can be abused in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1911)|
| 0:31:59| Just like I think Mr. Klein mentioned, that just because somebody dislikes you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| they can see you, a car parked in your yard, and they can call and report you and cause trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1924)|
| 0:32:12| And it's just a means of harassment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| And I think people will be using the government to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1935)|
| 0:32:21| And I think one question that probably that I haven't heard the answer to that an individual did mention to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1941)|
| 0:32:29| in a conversation today is, why are people parking in the yards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| And this individual I talked to, his explanation made a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1955)|
| 0:32:42| He said, now, some of these people are lazy and just don't want to walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| But then there's other people that just for the contour of their land, the layout of their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1966)|
| 0:32:52| they don't have any place else to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| They can park one car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| I was driving down Woodland this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| and I just happened to notice that there's a couple of people there with cars parked in the yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| Their driveway is going about 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| They're that close to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| They don't have an alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| If you've got more than one car, where are you going to park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| You can't park two cars on one of those houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| And that's just one example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| And there's just houses like that all across this city that this ordinance is going to have an effect on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=1998)|
| 0:33:26| And I just think it's wrong what we're imposing here on these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| And I think it's one of these things that will come back to haunt us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| Thanks, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| Councilwoman, I'm actually glad you spoke up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| because I think there is an argument that's to be made of this is the wrong thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2021)|
| 0:33:48| And I actually do appreciate often your ability to be the one vote against something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2028)|
| 0:33:55| And I guess I have two sort of thoughts about what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| One is just this complaint-driven, sort of decided, well, this is complaint-driven, so people can use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| Every law that's in the books right now is complaint-driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| I can call and complain about your dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| You don't even have to have a dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| I can make a complaint about a dog at your house, and some city person will come and investigate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| So this idea of this is what's going to be used to harass somebody just seems a little over the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2058)|
| 0:34:25| because, frankly, if I wanted to harass somebody, I've got plenty of things I can say about what's going on with anybody I want to harass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2065)|
| 0:34:31| So that's bizarre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| But I do think you do actually hit one of the interesting questions of driving all over this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2073)|
| 0:34:39| looking at places where people are parking in the yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| I did a lot of that early on as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| I think you've got a lot of places where people are just being lazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| You've got one near my house where there's a driveway that goes all the way in back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| and they park one car in that and then two in the yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| And that's just unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| It looks horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| The yard's wearing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| And that's really a matter of they just don't want to decide who's getting out first in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| But you do hit on the point that we've got a few locations in this city of people who have a driveway that will hold one or two cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2104)|
| 0:35:13| The topography doesn't allow them to get into their backyard or expand their driveway, and they don't have alley access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2113)|
| 0:35:21| I think the answer in most of those, and I know at Woodland where you're talking, the side streets there have street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2121)|
| 0:35:29| I know in my neighborhood we have street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| Just about every place I've seen that where the driveways aren't big enough, there is an ability for on-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2131)|
| 0:35:39| So I think it's going to work out, but I do think it's going to be an interesting bridge to cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| There's going to be somebody in this city who does not have the physical space on their property to park three cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2144)|
| 0:35:52| can't expand it without massive costs, and there's not on-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| And I'm not sure what happens then, but I think that's a bridge we cross because that's going to be a very few people that that will affect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2156)|
| 0:36:04| And I think for all those people that are being lazy, that just don't want to do it, this will fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| So it feels to me like while it does have its downside in affecting some of those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| who don't have the physical space to park cars and no way to expand a driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| there are going to be few and far between where the folks that are abusing it right now are pretty significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| I just want to express my appreciation to Mr. Hatton and Mr. Klein and Mr. McCall, if he's still here, for coming down tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2190)|
| 0:36:39| I do think that there are things to be concerned about with this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| When we first started looking at this, I told you about a conversation I had with someone who's had a daughter who'd moved back home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2203)|
| 0:36:51| because her husband was serving in Iraq.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| She had a student in college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| I mean, they just had a whole bunch of cars of people living at the same location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| So I do think there are things to be concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| I do plan to support this ordinance again, as I did two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| And the reason is because I think we have set up a process of review where I feel like it's conditional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2228)|
| 0:37:15| You know, I think we've asked for a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| We're going to come back and revisit this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| And the number of neighborhoods across the city that put hours into this ordinance are what have swayed me to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2241)|
| 0:37:33| I'm sure Mr. Blattner or Ms. Rowe or somebody could tell me it's 26 or 38 neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2253)|
| 0:37:39| Maybe Ms. Pilo, who was on the committee, there was a huge number of neighborhoods that threw their support behind this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2259)|
| 0:37:46| and who testified, this is a problem in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| And this was neighborhoods west, neighborhoods south, neighborhoods east, everywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| that said this is affecting the quality of life in our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| So I'm willing to support this on a conditional basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| I'm aware of the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| I want the people who are against this to know that I hear them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| And I'd like the chance to take this forward and evaluate it in a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2288)|
| 0:38:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| Other council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2296)|

| 0:39:12| Ms. Peele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| I just wanted to be sure that no one had signed up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| I don't have anyone signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| Well, thank you, because I had a call late this afternoon and someone thought they wanted to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| I think there's some interest in some conditions being placed on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| and my indication was that I thought at the NPC meeting on Thursday is probably the best place for that to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2368)|
| 0:39:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| So I think she must have made a decision not to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2375)|

| 0:41:14| Well, I just wanted to point out to Council, I mentioned this last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| we struggle with how to best zone this because of the adjacency to the form-based code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2477)|
| 0:41:25| south waterfront zoning area and zoning district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| and the work we went through and the discussion between Dave Hill and Mr. Donaldson and myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| and Ken Pruitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| Still not totally comfortable, but because this is a planned district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| it puts a lot of restrictions on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| and they would have to submit a development plan and a use and review application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| So whatever comes may come back to this council or may not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| but I think there are a lot of issues here that we're going to have to watch very carefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| and that's really all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2517)|

| 0:44:55| as well as members of the Historic Zoning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| to consider whether the provision of the zoning code related to the creation of a historic overlay district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2697)|
| 0:45:03| should be amended so as to require a certificate of appropriateness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| when a property owner elects to erect a fence located in an area in a historic overlay district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2706)|
| 0:45:12| where other improvements would require a certificate of appropriateness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2712)|

| 0:45:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| Very briefly, some folks in some of the historic overlay neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| some of which just left here on an earlier topic this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| brought this to my attention saying that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| the purpose of a historic overlay area is to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| have some uniformity along the areas seen by the public out on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2733)|
| 0:45:40| And they requested that this be considered where if you have to have to erect a fence in an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2740)|
| 0:45:47| that would otherwise require a certificate of appropriateness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| that the fence be considered too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| It's kind of a hard thing to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| I'm happy to try to answer, you know, any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| You know, certificates of appropriateness do not apply to the rear of a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2762)|
| 0:46:09| someplace that is not seen by the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| If you want to, you know, remodel the front end of your house that's right out there on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2771)|
| 0:46:18| a certificate of appropriateness would apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| This would address if someone wants to place a fence in the front yard of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2780)|
| 0:46:27| And this is just asking the Historic Zoning Commission to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2787)|
| 0:46:35| Any other questions for Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| This may be too early in the process to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| Are there standards somewhere about which the Historic Zoning Commission will judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2809)|
| 0:46:54| whether or not a fence is appropriate or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| or is it just going to be up to whether or not they like the picture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| Historic zoning has standards that are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| It relates to fences is what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| No, because there's nothing that applies to the fences right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| So is that the next thing that's going to come along?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| Well, it's asking them at first if they think this is something that should be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2831)|
| 0:47:16| and if so, to develop some standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| which would then go through the public process and ultimately be voted upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| But this is not the beginning and the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| This is the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| Councilman Hawthorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| This is just, as Councilman Frost said, just ask them to review it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| make recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| It would have to go through MPC and back to this council and be codified, like you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| And through Historic Zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2860)|
| 0:47:41| And through HCC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2861)|

| 0:48:11| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| 11D is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| with the Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| to provide Empowerment Zone funding in an amount not to exceed $128,320| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| for the Workforce Connections Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| I see is CAC going to be doing this or is Von Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| I see Von Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| Are you guys going to be doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| And Director Merrill-Harrell probably can answer all these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| And I read the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| I don't know it nearly as well as you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| What are the outcomes we're going to get out of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| What are they going to do and what are we going to get out of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| We would expect that you give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| I'm Von Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| I live at 8153 Crimson Tree Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| I saw the training cert paragraph and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| so help me in just hard layman's terms understand what's the in product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| and out product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| We expect every one of these participants who complete the training program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| to go to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| We place roughly 80% of the people who enroll in our program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2954)|
| 0:49:19| and of that 80% that complete, we expect every one of them to go to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2959)|
| 0:49:23| So the idea is to provide them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| So 80% complete the program and then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| And all go to work, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| And 100% of that go to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| 100% of that 80% goes to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| You all track that for about a year, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| I know that you talk about some of the training programs lasting for two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| going through State Tech and Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| Any of these dollars going directly to those organizations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| Yes, yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| We will provide tuition assistance to those organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| once we get people enrolled in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| That is correct, whatever their tuition happens to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| So only the 10% administrative costs, which stays with you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| everything else is going to scholarships?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| Everything else goes either to scholarships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| or it goes to activities which support that participation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| like transportation allowances, purchase of tools, that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| which actually benefits the participant in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| The only money we retain is the administrative cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| That 10%, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| And so this is going to deal with, what, 45 people plus pick-up 13| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| that are already in the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3021)|
| 0:50:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3022)|
| 0:50:23| We might actually enroll more than 45 in order to make sure we get 45 completions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| And then you track them for a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| After they finish, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| And how is the retention at the end of a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| In our regular Workforce Investment Act program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| which serves a very similar population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| our retention rate runs about 76% in the second quarter after program exit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| which can be pretty close to a year away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| That's how it's measured by the state in the WIA program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| Give me a demographic picture of who your typical client is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3050)|
| 0:50:56| a typical recipient is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| Well, we have really two types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| We have some, what we call regular adults,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| who are people who are unemployed or underemployed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| and need this training in order to become employed again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| Frequently they do not have a high school education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| It's sometimes necessary for them to work on completion of a GED| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| before they can be eligible to go into another program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| another training program after the GED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| Secondly, we serve a lot of people who are dislocated workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| who throw no fault of their own, have lost their employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| They sometimes frequently fall in the very same category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| Many of those have not finished a high school education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| particularly if they've been working in a factory job somewhere for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| and they get basically both of those groups get the same set of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| Do you see your dislocated worker pool increasing under the current economy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| Are you seeing that already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| Absolutely, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| With regard to your priority, there are dislocated workers, one or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| or is it your traditional unemployed individual you mentioned, the first example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3113)|
| 0:51:59| We have separate funding streams that are siloed for both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| and so they don't have to compete with one another for training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| Councilwoman Pilow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| Just one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| Do I understand that all these unemployed individuals have to live in the empowerment zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| to qualify for this program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| Under this contract, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| Now, the other funding that we have includes people who do not live in the empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| I wasn't familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| This is for Mrs. Rojero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| Typically, when we're provided information from empowerment zone funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| and things that this has been approved by P&I, how does this rank in terms of the priorities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3158)|
| 0:52:45| We're typically given information concerning the priorities of where EZ funding, it should go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3165)|
| 0:52:53| and where does this fall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| Well, this is very much in line with the empowerment zone goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3176)|
| 0:53:01| which is training and job creation or putting people into jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3181)|
| 0:53:07| In fact, since the empowerment zone was first initiated some nine years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3187)|
| 0:53:14| originally the empowerment zone funding was much broader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| You know, there was $100 million coming in for all kinds of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3197)|
| 0:53:22| A couple of years after it started, they started, as you all know, reducing the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3202)|
| 0:53:28| We haven't gotten but 25 percent of that original appropriation, and they've narrowed the focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| So they really stress economic development as opposed to, say, the social service piece that was part of it before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3212)|
| 0:53:39| and even broader housing issues that were part of it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| And so they really focus on the number of workers you've trained, the number of jobs you've created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3223)|
| 0:53:48| the number of businesses you've supported and things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| So this is actually a very good fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| It's similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| You all have this council has approved the Career Center contract in the past for several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3234)|
| 0:54:00| which does similar types of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| So this will just expand what we're already doing with the Career Center and using a different implementer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3242)|
| 0:54:08| How many groups applied for this particular funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3248)|
| 0:54:14| This was the only application that came in for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| And the P&I Board reviewed this, both the P&I Evaluation Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| and the P&I Planning and Allocations Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| Was this adequately advertised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| There wasn't an RFP process, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3267)|
| 0:54:33| Just a couple more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| Let me go to Councilman Roddy, then I'll come back to you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3278)|
| 0:54:39| I guess this question is for Director O'Hara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| I see that there will be quarterly reports from CAC as to the progress of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3281)|
| 0:54:46| Could those be provided to council as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| It's always rewarding, I guess, to see when we invest money that we're getting great outcomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3288)|
| 0:54:54| and I'd love to see those if that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| We would be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| Would you like to see the quarterly reports from all of our easy implementers or just from this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| I think all of them, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| We'd be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| We should be getting some early January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| It kind of closes the loop for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| You read about it on the front end, you do the research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| and you ask these questions, and then it's really nice to understand the outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3316)|
| 0:55:17| We'd be pleased to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| Yes, and I appreciate all the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| Councilman Frost was to ask a couple of my questions, but I want to follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| This was the only recipient, I think you said, that applied for this pool of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| Is this the first time that they've received this money for this particular activity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3329)|
| 0:55:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3335)|
| 0:55:36| Workforce Connections and Von Smith, their group was very instrumental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| as I understand it from those who were around prior to my being here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| very instrumental in helping the career center over at Pellissippi on Magnolia get that program started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3344)|
| 0:55:51| They have never received funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| But as you know, we're coming to the last year of funding as it stands now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| There are some dollars available, and this is something that is similar to what's been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3359)|
| 0:56:06| but an expansion allowing us to provide training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| and potential job placement for additional Empowerment Zone residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3369)|
| 0:56:14| And so the P&I Board felt that this was a good use of the dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| So this is in addition to the other activities that have been funded through P&I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| like the Career Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3382)|
| 0:56:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3383)|
| 0:56:24| This is in addition to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| So that's my next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| Is this replacing them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| So this is an additional service provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| An additional service provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| The Career Center at Pellissippi actually has a contract already through December 31st of 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3392)|
| 0:56:39| which we brought to you all earlier this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| And so we've got the Career Center there, and now we've got Vons Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3403)|
| 0:56:48| Workforce Connections, anybody else providing these types of services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| These are the only two providing the job training at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3411)|
| 0:56:56| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3424)|
| 0:57:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| 11E is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an amendment to the operating contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| between the City of Knoxville and the Public Building Authority of the County of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| and the City of Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| with respect to the management of World's Fair Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| to add management services for the lower Second Creek Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3438)|
| 0:57:25| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| Questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| Councilman Hucklis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| The various parking lots, the lower one closest to Nalen, that is a university lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3451)|
| 0:57:40| Nalen Drive you're talking now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3462)|
| 0:57:43| That is a university parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| PBA's responsibilities would only extend to the greenway, the concrete greenway surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3465)|
| 0:57:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| And I think the area there by the Rachmaninoff statue as well is included in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3474)|
| 0:57:59| Yeah, I'm thinking way down to Nalen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| But I'm just trying to figure out what they're going to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| And then as you get closer to Cumberland, there's a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| That's also on the west side of the railroad track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| Well, within the boundaries of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| That's also a university lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| So they're not responsible for any of the parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| No, I think this is, Steve, I think we're just talking about the greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| the property that we maintain on each side of the greenway, and then the area, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3503)|
| 0:58:29| that goes all the way from Cumberland down to Nalen Drive, but just the greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| and then the area there around the Rachmaninoff statue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| I think, Steve, have I got that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| Yes, there's a separate lease agreement with the university that details that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| and the parking lots are the university's to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3523)|
| 0:58:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| I guess this is a little follow-up on Joe's question, Councilman Holquist's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3531)|
| 0:58:56| We already have a maintenance agreement with PBA, correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| where we're paying them to maintain the greenway, everything we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| So I guess, you know, Councilman Holquist kind of hinted at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| What else is there to manage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| I think, Steve, can you go into that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| Well, a little bit, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| I think there's an overall operating agreement with PBA for the maintenance of certain facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3558)|
| 0:59:23| for example, the area on the waterfront and World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3563)|
| 0:59:30| When we contemplated constructing the Lower Second Creek Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| there was consideration given since it connected two areas that PBA already maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3575)|
| 0:59:41| that we would entertain the option of having PBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| contracting with PBA to maintain the Lower Second Creek Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| And that's what we have before you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| Well, no, this is, we did that about a year ago, two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| I mean, there was a maintenance agreement for the Lower Second Creek Greenway that's already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3596)|
| 1:00:05| Let me do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| Let me, can we, the person who was doing this is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| Let me, let's back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| I'd like to maybe ask that this be postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| Let us do some homework and come back to you because I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| And I could be wrong, but I remember having some of these same questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| I remember that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3623)|
| 1:00:24| So let me just suggest that I don't think we have the right person to answer this here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| but we will find that answer out, and I think maybe the best thing to do is postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3628)|
| 1:00:33| I think that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| Let me also apologize for not having asked these before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| No, it's our fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| We need to have the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| They're fair questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| So, but Councilman Hook, is your light still on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| Well, move to postpone for two weeks, first of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| Now, also, where the older connection, the older part of it, I guess you'd call it the Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3648)|
| 1:00:55| I don't know what you'd call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| It goes under Naland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| I guess it probably exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3659)|
| 1:01:00| It's like, who's responsible for that, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| I think that's still us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| To get a better idea of exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| Those are good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| Next to UT ramps that then connect to the Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| It's really an awkward setup in there, and I'd like to kind of know who's doing what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| Those are fair questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| Let us get the right people here to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| That's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| A lot of that's left over from the World's Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| Those ramps were all built for that, but then they built the boathouse down there, which is connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| So let me get somebody who can really delineate all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| Like I said, I think those are good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| Motion to postpone takes precedence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| We need to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3699)|
| 1:01:40| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3703)|
| 1:01:44| 11F is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an encroachment agreement with Birchtown LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| to permit a fixed awning to encroach over the sidewalk of 122 Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| I assume Birchtown is Lee Birch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| I see Lee Birch out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3726)|
| 1:02:07| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| 11G is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an encroachment agreement with La Pariego Restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| to permit a deck and canopy on a portion of the sidewalk at 416 Clinch Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3733)|
| 1:02:19| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3739)|
| 1:02:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| Questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| Councilman Hawquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| I think the restaurant is wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| I think having outside dining is wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3747)|
| 1:02:32| I know that they built this probably not realizing that they were going about it wrong without the permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3752)|
| 1:02:40| and without this agreement or, you know, whatever you call it, this action by council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3760)|
| 1:02:49| I'm a little concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| I know there's really no other way they can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| I'm a little concerned that it does take a lot of the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3774)|
| 1:03:00| And I guess my question would be, probably directed to Mr. King,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3780)|
| 1:03:07| if we determine at some point in the future, let's see, termination of agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3787)|
| 1:03:20| the only way this agreement can be terminated the way I read it, Mr. King,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| is that if they go out of business or the building is torn down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3804)|
| 1:03:33| that's the only way this agreement could be terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| It can't be revisited otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| So this is good in perpetuity and we don't have the city gives up all rights to go back and say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3818)|
| 1:03:46| after some period of time we've reevaluated this and we feel like it's encroaching too much based on new considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3826)|
| 1:03:54| as far as pedestrian travel, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| It appears that we don't have the opportunity to do that the way this agreement is structured right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| I can actually answer that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| We have reserve rights in paragraph four if we need use of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3850)|
| 1:04:11| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| I was just looking at five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| So if the city deems it's necessary for it to be removed for the city's use of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3854)|
| 1:04:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| That was really my only concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| Councillor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| How did this come to our attention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| Was this before BCA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3875)|
| 1:04:36| Debbie, do you know how this came to our attention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| We were advised that a stop work order had been put on the deck area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| That's when it came to the law department's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| We don't know where it originated, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| Was it complaint driven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| Did the city notice it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| Steve, do you know if we noticed the work going in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| I think there was some confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3896)|
| 1:04:59| The first time I was aware of this was at the downtown design review board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3899)|
| 1:05:04| and there was some confusion, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| about what additional permits needed to be acquired before this deck was constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3906)|
| 1:05:13| And the deck was built without a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| and Gary Norman's office went out and issued a stop work order on the deck construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3917)|
| 1:05:23| and they were the property owner was advised to go through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| which ended up with this action at council tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3927)|
| 1:05:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3934)|
| 1:05:35| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3935)|
| 1:05:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| Councilwoman Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3937)|
| 1:05:41| I think what we're all getting at is this kind of speaks to the situation that we keep running into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| where we have folks asking forgiveness, not permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| And I'm not quite sure how we get at it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| Mr. King and I have had a couple of these conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| and I don't know whether it's publicizing our permit process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3956)|
| 1:06:01| whether the assumption was just made that because we have outdoor dining on Gay Street and on Market Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| that when you start building a restaurant, that's something you can just do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| As someone else said, I think it's great for this organization to have outdoor dining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| and I'm glad to have another restaurant downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| but somehow when it comes to signs and decks and awnings and stuff, we need to get the cart before the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3978)|
| 1:06:27| We need to get the horse before the cart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| Would that be better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3992)|
| 1:06:33| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| I've been by this, and this is a fairly permanent structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=3997)|
| 1:06:42| If you look at what's at the Roop Hub and Sapphire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| it's metal stands that are very easily moved out of the way if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4006)|
| 1:06:54| And, I mean, this is four-by-fours, wood decking, two-by-eights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4014)|
| 1:07:02| So it's a little much, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| I've got concerns about, you know, if you go out and look at the sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4026)|
| 1:07:11| I mean, this is not just simply putting a table and four chairs out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4031)|
| 1:07:15| This is a much bigger thing, which I have real concerns about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4035)|
| 1:07:21| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4041)|
| 1:07:22| Yeah, I guess, you know, Ms. Grotty, you talk about permission versus forgiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4042)|
| 1:07:28| There's an interesting challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4048)|
| 1:07:29| I think one of the things that, and Gary Norman's here, and I hope I'm not saying anything out of line with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4049)|
| 1:07:34| but it feels like he's got sort of a fine line to walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| because at some level it would be real easy for his inspectors to say no to everything, and we don't want to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4057)|
| 1:07:43| And it feels to me, just speaking up for the department, it feels like they're doing the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| that occasionally things are getting built without, you know, getting permission beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| We generally find out about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| And I think that's a much better system than having inspectors who say no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| or inspectors who feel so defensive that they're driving all over looking for things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| So I think we're very much on the right target with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| And I think what it implies is somewhat what Mr. Frost is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| If we get something here where somebody's asking for forgiveness, we have to be willing to say no, take it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4088)|
| 1:08:15| And if we have concerns about it, I think I'd almost take the position of if they're asking for forgiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4095)|
| 1:08:23| and their problems, I'd give them less leeway than if they asked for permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| And, you know, I don't know if that's encouraging Mr. Frost to vote no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4106)|
| 1:08:30| but if you have real concerns, you should vote no on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| because, you know, I think we've got to both do the right thing for downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| and back up our inspectors in how they're trying to do this well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4116)|
| 1:08:41| Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| Well, I find that I'm very much in agreement with the comments that Councilwoman Becker made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| And somehow I became aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| I have to tell you, it was a very big disappointment to me that Larry Perrigo decided to leave the 2nd District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4129)|
| 1:08:56| and the Bearden area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| And I think a lot of people were, you know, regretted their decision to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| But it is a wonderful establishment, and I think it's going to be a real compliment to downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4142)|
| 1:09:09| and I think it will, you know, will compliment our downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| So, frankly, I take Councilwoman Becker's stance on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4153)|
| 1:09:18| And in hearing this discussed, and gosh, I can't remember where I first heard about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| I became aware that they were not aware that they needed this additional permitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4162)|
| 1:09:29| and that, unfortunately, they really got into this and would not have had they been aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4169)|
| 1:09:35| So I don't know where, you know, I don't know where the horse got behind the cart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4175)|
| 1:09:40| But I'm inclined to support it because I really feel that they're wanting to be a part of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4180)|
| 1:09:47| And in these times, I think we're grateful for those people who want to venture our way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4187)|
| 1:09:54| Councilman Bailey, and then I'll come back over to the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| I believe this is probably go to Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| You know, don't we have some standards or rules or guidelines, some definitions of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4199)|
| 1:10:06| how much we allow people to encroach on the sidewalk, how big the sidewalk is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4206)|
| 1:10:12| how much we'll allow of the sidewalk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| And my understanding, I defer to Mr. King if necessary, is that actually this is back to four feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| Or to five, originally from four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4221)|
| 1:10:24| Allow five feet of sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| This is a foot wider than in the minimum that we consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4225)|
| 1:10:30| So, I mean, it's well within the sidewalk that's there is well within the amount that is required, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4230)|
| 1:10:37| for safety and with an extra foot difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| And I would just concur, you know, on this question, Mr. Martin and I were just mentioning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4240)|
| 1:10:46| maybe what we need to do is just make a note when anybody comes in the downtown area for any kind of restaurant use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4246)|
| 1:10:52| or something that might require this to just remind them because it's something, if you don't know to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4252)|
| 1:10:59| it's kind of hard to build in a system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| I don't know that that would be that difficult, but we can work with Mr. Norman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| and try to make sure that everybody is alerted to the fact that you can't just anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4264)|
| 1:11:09| or have a right to put something on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| It has to be permitted first, might take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| But, Councilman Bailey, we are a foot within the allowable sidewalk and general sidewalk width here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4274)|
| 1:11:21| Well, you know, I haven't been over there, but when you look at the picture, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| you have to consider these trees and if you're thinking about people walking down a busy sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4284)|
| 1:11:29| it really just sticks out in the middle of the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4293)|
| 1:11:34| I do think that one of the reasons they had to go to the difficulty, from what Mr. Frost said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4294)|
| 1:11:39| of constructing this deck was to get it level for seating purposes rather than angled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4299)|
| 1:11:45| because the sidewalk isn't quite an angle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| So the whole thing is we should take it as an opportunity to learn another lesson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4307)|
| 1:11:52| to avoid some of the little procedural glitches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| But I do think the end product will end up being okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| and will allow for plenty of width on the sidewalk, having walked by it a number of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4317)|
| 1:12:03| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| To clarify what Councilman Becker was getting at, I had an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4324)|
| 1:12:10| The issue was not that they started and then they got caught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| That's not the issue at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| The issue that I have was here because it's the permanency of the structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4336)|
| 1:12:22| as opposed to metal fencing, which can much easier be moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4342)|
| 1:12:26| As Councilman Bailey mentioned, there's a tree right there that pinches down everything real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| So, you know, that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| I wish it was, you know, made of, you know, something a little less permanent, for lack of a better term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4354)|
| 1:12:41| Those are my sole concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| I share a lot of the concerns that have been expressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| I want to go back to our ability to terminate the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| I've read through four more carefully, and I apologize for not having read that earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4375)|
| 1:13:01| Apparently, number four only addresses removal if we have to make improvements to the sidewalk or utilities, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4381)|
| 1:13:12| It doesn't give us the right to require removal if we should determine at some point in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4392)|
| 1:13:19| that we need more sidewalk, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| I find that something that I don't believe I can live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4403)|
| 1:13:28| I don't have a problem with allowing them to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| but I think we need to have the ability to go back at a future date and say, you know, this really isn't working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4412)|
| 1:13:42| It's too restrictive, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| And I don't read that in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| The public improvement refers to the sidewalk, so it would cover that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4426)|
| 1:13:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| I guess I thought this was construction related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| You're saying it's just the definition of the use of the sidewalk fits that definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4435)|
| 1:14:00| If the city determines that they need to place, replace, or maintain that sidewalk in any way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4440)|
| 1:14:07| that would require them to remove the deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| It can do so under Paragraph 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4450)|
| 1:14:14| So you're saying if we determine that we need a wider sidewalk just to function as a sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| that that fits under the maintenance definition, perhaps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4459)|
| 1:14:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| To me, it's not that clear, and if it's not clear to me, I wonder if it's clear to these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4468)|
| 1:14:34| But I think that needs to be made very clear to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4478)|
| 1:14:39| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4480)|
| 1:14:41| Mayor, again, I haven't been there, but as I look at this picture, I'm not sure what this is made of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4481)|
| 1:14:46| and it's kind of ironic that Councilman Frost brought this resolution forward earlier about the fencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4486)|
| 1:14:53| and within overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| And we have downtown guidelines that are in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| and it seems to me that maybe there ought to be some sort of a consideration that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4499)|
| 1:15:05| when we look at these things, we consider the materials, and does it fit in, and is it tastefully done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4505)|
| 1:15:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| This is what unfortunately what you see now is because of the stop work order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| it's going to have a nice awning and be painted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| It will be very attractive when done, I do believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4522)|
| 1:15:26| At least it's certainly very unattractive right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| I will concede that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| And how do we know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4531)|
| 1:15:35| Well, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4535)|
| 1:15:36| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4536)|
| 1:15:37| In my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| Go ahead, Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4541)|
| 1:15:42| You know, the point is, is that if we're going to allow these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4542)|
| 1:15:45| that we know what kind of materials and it's presented to maybe the downtown guideline committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| or board and it's reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4550)|
| 1:15:54| Well, that's a very good suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| I think that now that we're running through this, and, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| part of one of the things we're new at and are learning on is the downtown design guidelines as things arise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4558)|
| 1:16:03| and I think this will allow us to clarify that some as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| I think we do have the owner here who maybe can address some of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| My name is Cedric Gouhant, 416 West Clinch Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| And, well, there's a lot of things, you know, everybody's talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| but we had a guideline at the beginning of the process when we did the permits and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4580)|
| 1:16:26| And that guideline, we went through commissions already, two commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| We went through all kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| And my consideration also, it's like sometimes people tell us we want to cut six inches of the deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4593)|
| 1:16:39| Sometimes people say we should take it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| Sometimes we should do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| Sometimes we should do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| We got the engineering department saying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| We got the person who wrote the law who was saying another thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4607)|
| 1:16:54| We got the building department who was saying another thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| And we are still stuck with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| I mean, seriously, if we get a deck, you know, when we talk about it at the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4620)|
| 1:17:05| when we did all the plans for it and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| everybody's like, yeah, no problem, you just need to follow the guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| We followed the guideline from to the T for everything, inside and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4631)|
| 1:17:17| And for me, I'm telling you, I moved the restaurant from the building area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4637)|
| 1:17:22| Why did I move?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| Because it wasn't working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| It's a beautiful restaurant, maybe, or anything, and people need to survive also to make a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4645)|
| 1:17:31| And we are trying right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| I mean, last week I did a survey again, you know, for this commission, $750.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| I know it's not much, but all the time, four months after, we start the process of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4658)|
| 1:17:44| for a 1,000-square-feet building downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| We did everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| The building, I don't know if anybody knew that building before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| but it was a building where it was nothing into it, just ghost building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4671)|
| 1:17:57| And now we are trying to do something very nice with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| and trying to survive at the same time as a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| And we get pushed back and pushed back and pushed back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| And I hear, you know, a lot of good comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| But on the guidelines, they say four feet from the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| We get a tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| We are six and a half feet from the tree itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| We are four and a half feet from the mulch, like the line of the mulch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4695)|
| 1:18:19| We get, like, example, like we can talk about problem, you know, it can occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| but we get bikes coming up all the time on the wrong way, which is going up on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4704)|
| 1:18:31| Well, they're on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| Well, nobody does anything, you know, for putting something aside on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| saying, well, no bike, you know, going on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| They are for the street, not by the bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| People work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4721)|
| 1:18:42| I understand people, they get handicaps and they need the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| And we're ready to do it for anything you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| We said if you need us to get six inches or ten inches, just let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4728)|
| 1:18:52| Just let us know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4732)|
| 1:18:55| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| Let's see, back to council folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| I don't know who was this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4739)|
| 1:19:00| Councilman Roddy, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| You know, I'm ready to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| I'm comfortable with Law Director Poplin's opinion that if any time in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| this structure is a detriment to pedestrian traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| that the city has the right to ask for its removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| I'd just like to underline Councilman Bailey's request to Dr. Lyons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| that the next time the Downtown Guidelines Committee meets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| that they consider adding some guidelines for folks about outdoor dining and decks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4761)|
| 1:19:26| and patios and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4766)|
| 1:19:27| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| So there are no guidelines now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| This was not reviewed and will not be reviewed under the current guidelines by the downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4772)|
| 1:19:39| I do believe that's where Mr. King said that he observed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| It came to light as it was being considered and approved, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| So they approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4788)|
| 1:19:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4789)|
| 1:19:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4794)|
| 1:19:55| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4795)|
| 1:19:56| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4796)|
| 1:19:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4797)|
| 1:19:58| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| I heard one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4800)|
| 1:20:01| I heard eight ayes and one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| It's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4803)|
| 1:20:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4804)|
| 1:20:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| 12A is an emergency ordinance to amend Section 2-477 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| regarding holiday pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4811)|
| 1:20:16| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4817)|
| 1:20:18| I've got a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4818)|
| 1:20:19| Somebody here from civil service and maybe the administration can answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| Before I get into my questions, it's not really associated with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| but I want to make sure that the record duly reflects that we also wish to say to Melissa Peters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4826)|
| 1:20:35| happy birthday also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| She had a birthday December 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| She said, quietly, trying to let it slip by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| We're not going to let it slip by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| We're not going to talk about how many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| Chair is sorry that he missed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4847)|
| 1:20:48| Yes, but that's why you've got a good vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4848)|
| 1:20:52| That's why I've got Cindy Mitchell over there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| She indicated that she had to come to work today much older than when she had left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4854)|
| 1:20:59| We want to wish Melissa Peters also a very happy birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4859)|
| 1:21:10| I guess I don't know if anybody is here from civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| If not, maybe Debbie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4875)|
| 1:21:16| That's the mayor, but I can try to answer your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| I guess first I'm going to ask the first Bob Becker question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| which he's not even going to ask because he's comfortable with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| Oh, well, I'll leave it for you then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| I was going to ask the why an emergency question on something that's affecting employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4886)|
| 1:21:30| and a very important issue, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| And then also I need someone to help me truly understand as I went through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4892)|
| 1:21:37| and I've looked back at the code also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| to understand what's the difference in what we have here versus what currently is on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4899)|
| 1:21:45| And maybe an example will help me out because the only difference is the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4905)|
| 1:21:49| We've added in with ordinary compensation versus taking that without loss of pay or leave credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4909)|
| 1:21:56| So I want to kind of see if somebody's got an example on what this means and how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4916)|
| 1:22:01| I'll take the latter first of actually what it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| And this just deals with it does not affect uniform bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4924)|
| 1:22:09| This is just general government, and it's for those people who work alternate work schedules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| which are the four ten-hour days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| And the way it was currently written on a typical holiday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| they might could expect ten hours of pay instead of eight hours as regular people, regular employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4939)|
| 1:22:26| If you are working on the holiday, you will get your one-and-a-half times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4946)|
| 1:22:32| But if you're off that day, this is to clarify that you just get the ordinary pay, which is eight hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4952)|
| 1:22:39| So it puts everyone on an equal balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| I saw the e-mail from, I forget the lady's name, e-mailed everybody on council from Melissa Berry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4964)|
| 1:22:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4974)|
| 1:22:55| And I began to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| Now, someone, and I apologize for being slow and being able to understand this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4977)|
| 1:23:03| but if someone's regular workday would have been a ten-hour workday based on the fact that they're doing four days a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4983)|
| 1:23:09| and getting 40 hours on that holiday, if you're cutting them to eight hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4989)|
| 1:23:13| aren't they getting shorted two hours for that week as opposed to being able to have 40 hours that week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4993)|
| 1:23:18| They're going to be credited with 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| Is that right, or am I missing the math there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| If that is a day, one of their four days, that they're going to work ten hours that day, and it's a holiday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5003)|
| 1:23:28| and we're basically saying, here, you're only going to get eight hours credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| You're losing two hours that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| You're not gaining on anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5013)|
| 1:23:34| You're actually losing two hours, or am I wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| That's actually how it's going to be applied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| but it's so that everyone that's working a 40-hour week will only receive eight hours of pay for a day that they are not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5019)|
| 1:23:47| But everybody won't get 40 hours a week, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| Somebody that week is only going to get 38 hours if it hits them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5029)|
| 1:23:53| Well, you see what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| Am I wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| And I apologize, but am I wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| If you tell the ten-hour-a-day person who works four days a week, 40 hours a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| that this holiday falls on your regular ten-hour day, but you're only going to get paid for a credit for eight hours that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5043)|
| 1:24:10| That week, they only have 38 hours of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| Well, the options are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| Am I wrong right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| Well, let me see if I can clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| The purpose of this is to bring clarity to what is a holiday pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| and define a holiday common to everybody that works 40 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5064)|
| 1:24:30| whether you work those 40 hours in five days or whether you work the 40 hours in four days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5070)|
| 1:24:36| Now, if you work it in four days and the holiday falls on one of your four days to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5076)|
| 1:24:41| what you would receive would be the holiday pay for eight hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| And then you have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| You can either take two hours of annual leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5085)|
| 1:24:49| or you can work with your supervisor and add 30 minutes on the other three days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5089)|
| 1:24:55| or some portion of that so that you would have, then, the equivalent hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5095)|
| 1:25:00| as would be a five-day, eight-hour person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| So it's the brain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5104)|
| 1:25:05| They're all working just 40 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| And the thought here for most of our alternate works is that those are options, and they choose to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5107)|
| 1:25:14| They get three-day weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| The others who work five days do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| And so we struggled with what was fair here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| and our conclusion was that what was fair was that if you worked a common 40 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5122)|
| 1:25:26| then you got a holiday that was worth the same amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| Debbie, did I help that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5130)|
| 1:25:33| Debbie probably helped that because she's much smarter than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| I still see a person losing two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| And I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5139)|
| 1:25:40| They can make it up somehow, so maybe one or three days that week instead of 10 hours, they work 12 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| Is that fair for them, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| I don't know that that's fair for that person, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| I see what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| And I got an e-mail that explains what you just said, and I read the e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| And then when I went back and looked at what we have here before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| it doesn't mention anything about only civilian employees and some of the examples that you put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5162)|
| 1:26:07| It kind of reads differently than what the explanation I'm being told right now is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5167)|
| 1:26:12| and basically what the e-mail said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| If you read what we have before us, I think, you know, it reads differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5174)|
| 1:26:19| Maybe it means the same, but it reads differently than the explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| There's no mention in the resolution or the ordinance, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5183)|
| 1:26:27| that says only apply to civilian or non-uniform employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5187)|
| 1:26:32| So that's very gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| We may need to make sure that that's in there somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| And I could actually clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| This Section 2-477 has other subparts, and subpart, I believe it's C, which is under that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5198)|
| 1:26:45| which addresses the uniform bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5205)|
| 1:26:48| So this is only amending the section dealing with general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5208)|
| 1:26:51| And this is further clarified in the new administrative rules that are going into effect January 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5211)|
| 1:26:56| which gets to your question of why it's an emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| this section to go into effect at the same time the new administrative rules did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5219)|
| 1:27:05| which is January 1st, which is actually a holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5225)|
| 1:27:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5229)|
| 1:27:10| And then I'm going to ask the follow-up Bob Becker question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| If we knew that was going to happen, why are we looking at it on the 30th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| and it's got to go into effect in a few days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| Because that's not one for you to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| But I'm still uncomfortable with how this works out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| So I may end up voting against this because I still don't think that's really the ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| I understand what you're trying to do, and it makes sense because you also don't want someone getting, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5246)|
| 1:27:31| When I first read it, I thought, okay, it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| Somebody is getting paid time and a half who's sitting at home and someone else who's working is not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5253)|
| 1:27:38| and that's not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| But the way I read it now, that's not even the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| What I see is someone having to get short of two hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| or find a way to work an additional two hours that week, which I'm not sure is fair to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5264)|
| 1:27:50| It makes fair sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| And I'm probably the only one out here on this island,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| and I'm fine to be out here on this island by myself and maybe the light will come on tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5274)|
| 1:27:59| but I'm just not real clear about it, nor do I think it's as fair as it's trying to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5279)|
| 1:28:04| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| Well, Mr. Vice Mayor, I often find myself alone on islands with this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5287)|
| 1:28:12| I think I'm sort of on the same island you're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| I have some of the same concerns reading it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| I had a good conversation with Ms. Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| I actually talked to Ms. Berry at civil service and Ms. Cash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| and Ms. Cash actually did a better job explaining it because I think she deals with this a little more with the league.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5303)|
| 1:28:30| So I don't know if she wants to take a second to explain any thoughts you have on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5310)|
| 1:28:35| But I do want to go back to the emergency ordinance question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| And I guess, Ms. Cash, do you want to add anything to what's been said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| Yes, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| Anita Cash, and I am the president of the City Employees Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| And as I understand, this has been a problem for some time, excuse me, with the way people have received holiday pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5328)|
| 1:28:56| And the way it was explained to me, if you work a four-hour, I mean a four-day week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5336)|
| 1:29:01| and you get a holiday that falls on your day, you're working 30 hours that week and you're getting paid for 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5341)|
| 1:29:09| But if you work a five-day week, you work 32 hours to get paid for 40 because of the holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5349)|
| 1:29:21| Well, okay, so you're telling them that, so the injustice goes the other way now for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5361)|
| 1:29:27| You say, well, for several years, folk got two hours, I guess, you know, got 30, worked 30 hours, not 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5367)|
| 1:29:34| So now we're going to go back and make them work, I guess, 32 or 34 hours and everybody else only works 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5374)|
| 1:29:41| And I don't see, you know, it's the other side of the coin, which still says it's not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5381)|
| 1:29:46| And I don't understand how we get, I don't know where we get to the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5386)|
| 1:29:49| But I still don't see it as being fair to, if you choose to have your work schedule be that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5389)|
| 1:29:54| and you're just lucky that year that your day falls on that holiday, it's so big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5394)|
| 1:29:59| You know, you're doing a four-day work week to help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| A lot of times it's individuals who are dealing with child care, you know, managing other issues of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5402)|
| 1:30:08| and it's a very beneficial option for employees to be able to work four days sometimes a week and 40 hours a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5408)|
| 1:30:16| But I just see this is now, it's penalizing folk for working four days a week and 10 hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5416)|
| 1:30:25| And I think it's penalizing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5425)|
| 1:30:26| And on the other hand, what I hear Ms. Cash saying is other folk getting penalized for not choosing that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5426)|
| 1:30:31| And I see your frustration in trying to find a balance, Mr. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5431)|
| 1:30:35| And I guess my problem is I just see it still as not being quite right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5435)|
| 1:30:39| It doesn't sit quite right with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| I'm going to listen to some more discussion here and maybe it will become clearer for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5441)|
| 1:30:47| I guess having done some work, that idea of how you do with a holiday for people who work different days is always a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5447)|
| 1:30:55| And I think you hit it exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| Do people get 10 hours or eight or, you know, do people who work four-hour days get nothing when it's a Friday holiday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5457)|
| 1:31:04| You know, it becomes very challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| My tendency is to think that the Civil Service Board has done a good job with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5466)|
| 1:31:10| I know the Employee Association is supportive of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5470)|
| 1:31:16| Again, I have a concern on the emergency side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| And I guess, Ms. Poplin, if you could go a little further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5478)|
| 1:31:21| My sense is always that things like this that could be controversial are better done when we do them on two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5481)|
| 1:31:27| There's more time for people to ask questions, to think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| I mean, the light could go on for Mr. Brown tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| And that makes a big difference if this is not an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5494)|
| 1:31:37| It's useless if it's emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| So can you tell me what happens if we don't pass this on emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5499)|
| 1:31:43| There will be a question on pay for January the 1st, which is a holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5503)|
| 1:31:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5510)|
| 1:31:51| Well, there wouldn't be a question because it hasn't been passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| We pay the way we did, we've done for the last part of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5513)|
| 1:31:57| There will be confusion because Civil Service has worked very diligently on developing administrative rules to correct this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5517)|
| 1:32:05| not realizing that there was a code section that addressed this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5525)|
| 1:32:09| So they need to be brought together or there will be a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5529)|
| 1:32:14| So the administrative rules that they did a good job on are done, are done well in advance, were all done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5534)|
| 1:32:20| And somewhere in the process somebody noticed, oh, there's a piece in the code that we've got to change as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| And we noticed that last week kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| Does anybody have any idea of approximately how many of our non-uniformed employees opt for the four-day week option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5549)|
| 1:32:39| It's a pretty small number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5559)|
| 1:32:40| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5560)|
| 1:32:41| Anita or Larry, do any of you all have a guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| We've actually done some work on this and surveyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| But it's still, it was more than I thought, but it's still a rather small number, Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5566)|
| 1:32:55| I'm sorry that I can't recall the actual number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| Is it less than 50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| Less than 50 percent or 50 people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| Fifty people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5582)|
| 1:33:03| No, it would be more than that, would be my guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5583)|
| 1:33:07| But I am strictly guessing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5587)|
| 1:33:12| Councilman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5592)|
| 1:33:13| I might, if I might add, in preparation for this, and as Ms. Poplin has explained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5593)|
| 1:33:21| we're trying to bring clarity to where there was conflict between the two areas where this is addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5601)|
| 1:33:28| The departments, as I understand it, that are most affected had been talked with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5608)|
| 1:33:33| the directors had been talked with, and got their understanding of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5613)|
| 1:33:38| and their buy-in that this was a fair approach to how we were doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5618)|
| 1:33:42| And quite frankly, we were doing it inconsistently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| We had it addressed in different areas in different ways, and we were applying it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5624)|
| 1:33:50| And we need to have parity with how we apply this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| And this is what our attempt to do here, and to be fair with everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5633)|
| 1:33:57| I don't want to muddy the waters any further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| and I know why we have the differences between non-uniformed and uniformed employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5639)|
| 1:34:07| And this doesn't affect our uniformed body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| And they fall under the old rule, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| It doesn't affect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5652)|
| 1:34:15| Scratch that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5655)|
| 1:34:16| That's going to open up a whole other can of worms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5656)|
| 1:34:23| Somebody else, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5663)|
| 1:34:24| Ms. Piloff, save the vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5664)|
| 1:34:28| I can't be saved on this no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| I think I'm going to be the one against probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5674)|
| 1:34:35| Ms. Piloff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5675)|
| 1:34:36| I certainly understand Vice Mayor Brown's concerns here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5676)|
| 1:34:41| And I did not receive an email from an employee, from Ms. Berry or whomever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5681)|
| 1:34:46| so this kind of is catching me as didn't know that there was anyone who had a question about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5686)|
| 1:34:52| But Ms. Cash's comments, I know her long history as being a spokesperson for the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5692)|
| 1:35:02| That goes way back, doesn't it, Anita?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| So I feel so comfortable when she is comfortable with what her employees have had communicated to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5705)|
| 1:35:15| And if they have bought into it and been with the comments Mr. Martin made just now, that gives me a little more comfort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5715)|
| 1:35:23| I was about to be out there on the island with you, Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5723)|
| 1:35:28| I know it would have been too much to contemplate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| I need to be here by myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5731)|
| 1:35:32| But we might leave you back there by yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| I think I can support it based on Ms. Cash's comments because that means a great deal to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5734)|
| 1:35:40| to know that the employees understand this and are pleased with the decision Civil Service has made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5740)|
| 1:35:48| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| Ms. Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| Mr. Hall and I have a question over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| A joint question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5755)|
| 1:35:56| A joint question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| If a holiday like New Year's Day, if that falls on a Saturday, is that a paid holiday regardless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5759)|
| 1:36:07| or it's not a paid holiday that year because it falls on Saturday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| I think we would give that, in that case, we would give that Friday would be the paid holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5770)|
| 1:36:15| New Year's Day is a paid holiday like Christmas Day is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5775)|
| 1:36:18| And if it falls on the weekend, it's whatever the closest day is to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5778)|
| 1:36:22| We were trying to figure out for these folks that are on the four-day week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| if a holiday falls on a day that you don't work, like if you work Monday through Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5785)|
| 1:36:31| and Christmas Day is a Friday and everyone else who works a five-day week is being paid not to work on Christmas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5791)|
| 1:36:39| do you get paid not to work on Friday when you don't usually work on Friday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| You do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| You do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5804)|
| 1:36:45| It sounds like you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| You get paid eight hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5806)|
| 1:36:47| Are we right, Debbie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5809)|
| 1:36:50| But you get paid eight hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5810)|
| 1:36:51| But even though it's not usually a day you work anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| Then you'd have 48 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| Because you get the holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5815)|
| 1:36:56| Wouldn't you have 48 hours that week if that's the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5816)|
| 1:37:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5820)|
| 1:37:01| You see what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5821)|
| 1:37:02| I mean, this is confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| Then you get 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5824)|
| 1:37:08| Let me guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5828)|
| 1:37:09| No one's here from civil service because they're taking a paid holiday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5829)|
| 1:37:14| Actually, it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5834)|
| 1:37:17| If you look at that scenario, if it goes to a 48-hour week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| then the person who's working 40 hours on Fridays a week, now they're in a whole eight hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5840)|
| 1:37:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5847)|
| 1:37:28| The question is, do you get paid for a day that you don't normally work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5848)|
| 1:37:34| I think I'm wrong in my answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| I think I was hasty in my answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5857)|
| 1:37:39| And I think if that's a day that they're not normally working, they would not be paid for that holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5859)|
| 1:37:45| But I could be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5868)|
| 1:37:49| I think everybody gets the same number of paid holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5869)|
| 1:37:51| You get the same number of paid holidays?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| They get the same number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| But if it's on their day off, they can take eight hours off on another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5874)|
| 1:37:58| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| Is that the way it works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5880)|
| 1:38:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5881)|
| 1:38:02| So everybody is entitled to nine holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5882)|
| 1:38:06| So I don't think we couldn't possibly be denying anyone one of those nine holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5886)|
| 1:38:10| So they don't get paid for 48 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5890)|
| 1:38:14| They get to take it at another point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5894)|
| 1:38:17| That would be the clarity to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5900)|
| 1:38:21| I count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5901)|
| 1:38:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5902)|
| 1:38:23| Everybody clear as mud now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5903)|
| 1:38:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| You can see why we struggled so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5907)|
| 1:38:28| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5908)|
| 1:38:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5909)|
| 1:38:30| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5910)|
| 1:38:31| I heard one no over here from an island distant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5911)|
| 1:38:36| I got closer with that last question, you know, and that last explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5916)|
| 1:38:40| I got a little closer understanding, but I'm still not very clear, so I've got to vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5920)|
| 1:38:46| He'll swim in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| 12B is an ordinance amending the Knoxville City Code Appendix B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| Zoning Regulations, Article IV, South Waterfront District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| providing new street section designations in Chapter 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| and creating new street standards within Chapter 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5939)|
| 1:39:03| Good to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5943)|
| 1:39:04| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5944)|
| 1:39:05| Counselor Norquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| Counsel, you'll notice that Mr. Hill has done an extraordinary job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5947)|
| 1:39:10| in his council information sheet or agenda information sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5950)|
| 1:39:14| It's two pages long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| There's a lot to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5956)|
| 1:39:17| Essentially, as you know, the form-based code does something that no zoning code has done before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5957)|
| 1:39:23| in that it actually regulates the street design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| and we had to essentially revisit and do some modifications to the code in order to work through the details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5966)|
| 1:39:35| that are now coming out of the final design that's being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| So it's not as complicated as it may seem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5978)|
| 1:39:43| It's just one of the steps, and this explains the whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5983)|
| 1:39:47| It explains where we are with MPC and having to go to them for the final plat for the resubdivision, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5987)|
| 1:39:54| So there's a lot of information here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081230?start=5994)|
