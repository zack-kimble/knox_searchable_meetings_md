| 0:03:47| Good afternoon, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| Would you state your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=230)|
| 0:03:52| Yeah, my name is Mr. Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=232)|
| 0:03:54| I'm attached to Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=234)|
| 0:03:55| Address is 238 Andrew Johnson Highway, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| Okay, I'm going to explain to you briefly the procedures here on this violation is that the sheriff's office will make a statement as to the allegation about sales to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=239)|
| 0:04:12| At that point, you will then answer and say you either admit it or deny it, and you are free to say whatever you want in your defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=252)|
| 0:04:20| Do you understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| Okay, I turn it over to the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| On August 12, 2021, officers of Knox County Sheriff's Office conducted a compliance check at the Shell Station located at 238 Andrew Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=266)|
| 0:04:34| The defendant sold alcoholic beverage to an underage person without checking the ID, and they were cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=274)|
| 0:04:44| The defendant became belligerent with the office, refused to give the ID back at first, but did so in the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=284)|
| 0:04:53| You've heard the allegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| Do you understand it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| Do you admit or deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| I do admit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| Okay, is there anything you would like to say with regard to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| We don't condone underage sale at the store at all, and I know the defendant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=302)|
| 0:05:08| I kind of explained to him to never, I guess, don't argue with the law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=308)|
| 0:05:12| At least be cooperative with them, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| I know he kind of argued with the police officer at the store, but he knows it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=315)|
| 0:05:21| He knows it now, and also, he's taking servers education classes that he can be educated on how to next time spot underage sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=321)|
| 0:05:30| and ask for IDs for underage minors under the age of 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=330)|
| 0:05:38| I turn it over to you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| Thank you, Director Boone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| I'd like to entertain a motion before we open it up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=342)|
| 0:05:49| Mr. Chairman, as the 8th District Commissioner, we have a standard way of dealing with first offenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=349)|
| 0:05:58| and so I will move that we offer a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension of the license, whichever the gentleman chooses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=358)|
| 0:06:14| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| A first by Commissioner Beeler and a second by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| We're going to open it up first for discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| but can you do me a favor and re-spell your first name again for the clerk's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| Yeah, Mitesh, M-I-T-E-S-H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=389)|
| 0:06:36| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| We'll open it up for discussion now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| From the Sheriff's Department, in your report you said alcoholic beverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| I want to make sure we are talking about a beer product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| It was a beer product, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| And you had also said that he didn't check the ID, but then the clerk wouldn't give the ID back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=414)|
| 0:07:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| The young lady had given the ID to the clerk after the sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=424)|
| 0:07:10| and they had come back in for proof to show, and he had hung on to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| Okay, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| Sheriff Lawson, given this specific instance at this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| has anything else ever happened at this store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| We cited this store last Tuesday as well for underage sales of alcoholic beverages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=451)|
| 0:07:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| We have a first and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| I see no other lights on for debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| Those opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| If you will, see the clerk when we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| Which one did he accept?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| I think it was the $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| Did you accept the $1,000 fine or the 30-day suspension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| I do accept the fine, but can I say something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| As you know, the labor shortage, we've been hiring employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| Employee turnaround time is about a week now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| and most of them, like the first employee that was cited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| he hasn't been back to work for about a month now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| because they don't answer phone calls or text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| As soon as this happens, we try to call them through the store phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| or email, but they don't check their email anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=511)|
| 0:08:40| Commissioner Daly, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| Just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| Do you have a scanned reader that they can look at the driver's license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=525)|
| 0:08:48| It's only $1,000, or actually it's less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| I think it's about $800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| I haven't missed anymore, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| We did last year because of this reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| I guess a customer comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| If they're drinking a non-alcoholic beer that requires an ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| it comes up on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| Right now we're working on trying to make it where they have to permanently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| scan the ID rather than just hitting any birth date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| They have to scan it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| They can't just hit their birth date, any birth date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| That way they can bypass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| But we do have a system in place where they actually scan the back of the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=566)|
| 0:09:35| Mr. Smith, how many employees do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=575)|
| 0:09:40| Right now we have one, two, three right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| We normally have five to six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| I'm glad that the offender went to the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| No, he's going to have to take the class before he comes back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| because he needs to take the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| Alcohol education, he needs to learn how to ID underage sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| Okay, next we're going to move on to 5B, which is Lee's Food Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| Clerk, would you like to read the application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| We already voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| It's Lee's Food Market, number 1267608 Rutledge Heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=620)|
| 0:10:26| and it's District 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| Now I'll turn it over to Director Booth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| Good afternoon, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| Could you please state your name for the record and your business address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| Yes, my name is Gail Wilder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| and the store is 7608 Rutledge Pike in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=640)|
| 0:10:49| You have seen the prior one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| I'm going to say once again the sheriff will give the allegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| You will have a chance to either admit it or deny it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| and then anything that you would like to say to this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| you can feel free to do that at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| Do you understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| Okay, at this point I'll turn it over to the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| On August 12, 2021, officers of Knox County Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| conducted an alcohol compliance check at Lee's Food Mart, 7608 Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=672)|
| 0:11:17| The defendant sold an alcoholic beverage to an underage person after checking their ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=677)|
| 0:11:23| Do you admit or deny that allegation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| Yes, that did happen, but the employee, which is no longer employed there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=687)|
| 0:11:35| he came to court, and I do have a statement from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| He was going to come, and they dismissed his case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| Is it okay if I read what they done when he came to court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| You can state anything you want before the panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| The employee was Jeffrey Johnson, and he said the young lady came into the store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| wanted to buy a beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| When she reached the counter, Jeffrey asked for ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| looked for the ID, and simply typed in 23 instead of 03.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| According to Jeffrey, her real date of birth was 11-22-2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| To the best of my knowledge, the registrar has recognized this as 1923,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| and he'd allowed the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=735)|
| 0:12:16| 2023 has not yet come to pass, which we know that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| but according to Gregory, the officer believed that he truly did check the ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| because he read the birth date and the lady's name back to the officer from memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=744)|
| 0:12:29| The officer told Gregory to be absolutely sure that he brings the receipt with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| to his court date as he could see what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| Gregory explained that he was a diabetic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| and he checked his blood sugar shortly after the incident, and it was 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| He did not feel well, and he explained that he made a typo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| but he did indeed look at the lady's ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| He also stated that he had sold alcohol before in another job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| and he knew the laws very clear regarding the sale of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| In no way, he explained, was he intentionally trying to break the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| It was simply a counseling mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| Does the sheriff have anything to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| I guess I'd ask the sheriff a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| Was there an underage sale of alcohol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| Yeah, he sold to an underage person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| I'll turn it back over to the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| Thank you, Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| But at this time, I would like to entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=795)|
| 0:13:22| Well, consistent with our practices, I'll move for a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| but I am open to discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| Second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| Okay, I'm going to open the floor for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| Just to clarify again, on the date, you said something about 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=822)|
| 0:13:48| Could you kind of run that through again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| I got a little bit confused on when he put the date of the person in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=830)|
| 0:13:55| Yeah, he says he put it in that instead of doing 2000, he put in her birth date was 11-22-2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=835)|
| 0:14:05| But he typed in 23 instead of 03.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=845)|
| 0:14:11| Okay, but that would make him, I mean, he wouldn't even be born yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=851)|
| 0:14:18| But the system still allowed him to sell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| According to court, I'm just, I wasn't there, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| So I'm just, you know, I'm the general manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| I'm just telling you basically what I've read from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| But I will say that we, like, within a week after this, we got caught again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=870)|
| 0:14:38| So that's going to be our second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| So we'll be back or we can take, you know, whatever we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| But what I'm saying is since the second offense, we have got the scanning in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| And so we are making progress to, you know, to try our best to get this taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=890)|
| 0:14:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| I just wanted to note, even though we certainly have the laws that we need to follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| that I notice this is their first offense in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| So that's nine years with a clean record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| Clearly, I think that indicates that you've certainly tried to be very diligent up until this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=915)|
| 0:15:21| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| Ms. Wilder, the motion on the floor is for a $1,000 fine or 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| Which do you choose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| We'll do the $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| I have a motion by Commissioner Beeler and a second by Commissioner Boehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=935)|
| 0:15:40| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| You would see the clerk run this through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| Actually, the clerk just informed me she'll send you a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| Next, we're going to move on to item number six on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| It's going to be a discussion item for a special event beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| for the under construction JAMA benefit for Children's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| Do I have a representative here from the benefit for Children's Hospital, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=970)|
| 0:16:21| Hi, I'm Aaron Snuckles, and with me is Angie Howell from Children's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| Can you spell your last name for the record and give your address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| Snuckles, S-N-U-K-A-L-S, Snuckles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| Is it Angie Howell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| Howell, H-O-W-E-L-L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| Thank you both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| At this time, I'm going to turn it over to Director Buch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| I'm going to ask you a few questions as we ask all applicants for a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| As I understand, as a precursor, you had finally filed everything with the city of Knoxville Beer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1013)|
| 0:17:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| I went on automatic pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| I had probably 20 beer licenses, special events with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| and I automatically just went back into automatic pilot and then realized that was the mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| And then my second option was a caterer who had an offsite catering license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| and then found out that there's no such thing as an offsite catering license in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1040)|
| 0:17:26| So when I found out that I couldn't use an offsite caterer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| then I called the wonderful lady in the clerk's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| and we figured out that there really wasn't a special events license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| but we could use this form and we could fill this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| and that's how we got here today in the very last minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| and I appreciate you guys letting us come before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| Well, I'm required to ask you certain questions, which we ask of all applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| and you've been sworn, so here's a questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| Have you or any of your employees at this location that you're intending asking for a special permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1074)|
| 0:18:02| been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession, sale, manufacture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| or transportation of intoxicating liquor or a crime involving moral turpitude within the past ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1086)|
| 0:18:13| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| Has beer ever been sold at this special outside location before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| I don't think the drive-in or the flea market, it's been closed for ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| so I really don't know what happened before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| But the children's hospital's never done one here, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| You wouldn't know whether there's an outstanding beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| You don't have an outstanding beer license from a children's hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| It's kind of a strange set of questions for your situation, but I've got to go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| I take it your application is a special application for on-premises consumption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1129)|
| 0:18:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| You're not on and off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| You're not selling it to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| You're on premises for five hours, actually four and a half hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| And it's my understanding you do not own these premises, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| Other than children's hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| is there anybody else involved in this charitable event other than children's hospital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1150)|
| 0:19:17| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| Who's going to be the one responsible there at your event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| to make sure that liquor or beer is not sold to minors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| Yes, I will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| I've been to the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| Like I said, I've done this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| I've already contacted the Sheriff's Department for Health Special Security to be on site for all our ID checking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1174)|
| 0:19:41| and we'll do a really good job because we only have to do it for four hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| We're not doing it for a long period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| so we have the people there to concentrate on it to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| We also offer free rides home for anybody who can't get home on their own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| so we'll make sure that people get home safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| Are you familiar with the Knox County and Tennessee beer laws and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| and do you agree to conduct your business that day, whatever day you set aside, in conformity with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1201)|
| 0:20:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1208)|

| 0:20:31| Okay, and the fire marshal would be the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| Yep, no issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1234)|

| 0:21:35| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| So this is the first time for a special type beer permit for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1297)|
| 0:21:44| which this venue that they're going to, the old drive-in up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| I think we probably need to be seeing more of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| so we may need to look at an application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| One of my questions is, how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| Is this good for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| Is this good for 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| Is this good just for the event when you have them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| I have a question for two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| Yeah, but I'm saying we approve it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| Mr. Law Director, if we approve this today, is it good for a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| Do they have their event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| No, it's event specific for the two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| It says on my permit over to the two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| On my construction permit, it says for the Children's Hospital event on October 14th and 15th and the times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1345)|
| 0:22:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1353)|

| 0:22:41| but it's not ready yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| We just wanted to try to do this for Children's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1366)|

| 0:22:48| Good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| Like I said, also the catering license thing, that seems to be a shock for a lot of folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| that people didn't realize that an off-site catering license wasn't good in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1374)|
| 0:23:00| So it might be something else you consider later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| The floor is still open for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=1383)|

| 0:34:10| Whereas some forms of dysautonomia are considered rare diseases, such as multiple system atrophy and pure autonomic failure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2050)|

| 0:36:58| I will tell you they have one of the most compelling stories of any family that I've ever met in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2218)|
| 0:37:04| Dealing with this journey, figuring out what it was, and finally getting a diagnosis for their children has been an extreme journey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2224)|
| 0:37:14| that I will tell you any of us that have parents or have children or younger nieces and nephews cannot even imagine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2234)|
| 0:37:26| just truly cannot even imagine the impact that it has not only on the child but the entire family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2246)|
| 0:37:33| So I'm proud to bring this. I've asked Chris and Kristen if they would say a few words, and when they finish I have one more word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2253)|
| 0:37:44| First I'd like to say thank you to the Commission and Terri Hill in particular for her support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2264)|
| 0:37:52| We do have three children that struggle with COTS along with some other illnesses that tend to go with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2272)|
| 0:37:58| It can be pretty debilitating for two of our children. They have been homebound for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2278)|
| 0:38:04| One does require a feeding tube, one has a central line with infusions daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| So it's been a challenge, and one of the biggest challenges we found is the lack of awareness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2288)|
| 0:38:15| So we appreciate you helping us with that so that we can lead to more opportunities for research and more treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2295)|
| 0:38:23| So one of the things we're doing to better that and get more funds towards that research is an upcoming fundraiser,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| and I'm going to let Shannon speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2309)|

| 0:42:42| we added one new educational video to our YouTube library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| We had 70,969 views for the month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2566)|

| 0:43:28| that we've been in a lot of neighborhoods this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| And that will continue into September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| and most assuredly through October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| as we are unsure whether or not we'll have our open houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| at the fire stations due to the latest uprising in COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| It is always fun to go out into the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| and show off our equipment to the future firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2624)|

| 0:43:50| of our communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| but we also love seeing the expressions on our customers' faces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| when we discuss the benefits of supporting rural metro fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| and thus keeping their taxes low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| We are entering into fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| and I love to see the seasons change in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| I do not like to see the leaves come off the trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| because then I have to rake them up and dispose of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| So, we urge you to help us educate our fellow citizens in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2655)|
| 0:44:21| to dispose of that natural rubbish the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2661)|

| 0:44:30| We need to remind folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| that they must obtain a burn permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| and follow the rules for open burning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| The number one rule is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2677)|

| 0:44:46| as well as being respectful of our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| So, that would be our urging for this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2689)|

| 0:44:59| Any questions from the Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| Thank you again, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| for an excellent report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| Mr. Burke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| On page two, item number three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| presentation by Eagle Scout Ethan Anderson of Troop 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| I'd like to invite Mr. Anderson to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| And I do want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| we are extremely proud of Ethan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| I was fortunate to be at Ethan's Eagle Scout ceremony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| back in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| and I felt like that day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| that we wanted him to share with the Commission his project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| because it was a really cool project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| really beneficial, I think, to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| and to the 8th District in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| So, Ethan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| tell us who you are and your address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| and you may then proceed with your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| Thank you all for having me come here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| I'm Ethan Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| My Eagle Scout project is building a blacksmith shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| at the historical Ramsey House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| Look up on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| Of course, Mr. Beeler gave a donation to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| and that helped the project a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| So, basically what I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| is I went to the Ramsey House,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| and I asked them what they needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| because I had taken a tour there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| and they had talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| that they wanted to become a living history museum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| and that involves a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| and I love history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| It's one of my passions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| Ethan, can I ask you to raise that microphone up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| just a little bit so everybody can hear you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| You're a little taller than the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| I get that a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| One of the things they wanted was a blacksmith shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| and along with my love for history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| is I like to do blacksmithing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| It's a hobby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| and so I proposed to the then director at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| Miss Judy LaRose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| that I ask her if I could build them a blacksmith shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| for my Eagle Scout project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| because I was looking for one at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| and I was a bit shorter then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| and I was 14 at the time when I asked her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| and she was a little hesitant at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| I guess I'd assume a 14-year-old comes to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| and asks to build a blacksmith shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| on your historical property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| You would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| but they decided to let me give it a try,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| which I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| and it was a great project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| You can see in the picture there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| there's the day that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| well, a few days after the concrete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| had been poured on the footers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| They're putting the logs up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| because it's a 12 by 15 log structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| with a fully working brick forge on the inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| It's all done as historically accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| as I could have done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| There's a picture of all the guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| that came out and helped me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| put the logs and the timber framing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| on the top up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| It's just amazing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| the community support that I got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| and the support from local businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| It's currently working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| Depending on what day you go out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| you might see a blacksmith out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| working in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| I partnered with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| Clinch River Blacksmith Guild.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| They helped me with a lot of the historical things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| to do with the actual blacksmithing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| on the inside of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| They were a great help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| and some of them have already been out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| doing some work in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| It's just, it's a great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| I think it's a great project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| I hope that y'all can someday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| make it out there and take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=2925)|

| 0:50:00| no matter what I've done in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3000)|

| 0:50:08| So much their hero that they dress up as me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| beg to have my handcuff cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3011)|

| 0:50:15| to put on their belts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| just to imitate me in my career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| I am a man of faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3020)|

| 0:50:37| My wife is also a great woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| She is an RN| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3039)|

| 0:50:45| to become a nurse practitioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| My children attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| elementary school in West Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| and they love the schools that they're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| So I say without hesitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| we are the best we can be for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| We have devoted our family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| to helping Knox County civilians in many ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| and will always continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| I began my professional career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| after college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| at Denzel Manufacturing in Maryville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| I was making great money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| had great insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3076)|
| 0:51:17| and there were always opportunities for advancement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| The shifts were long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| the job was easy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| but I wanted more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| I wanted to be more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| have more, and do more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| because as the saying goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| a man's wealth is not found in his bank account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| After leaving Denzel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| I applied at the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| I wanted the brotherhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| and strong character you see displayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| from every KCSO officer you encounter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| I was hired as a corrections officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| in May of 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| When I first took this job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| it was a $20,000 a year pay cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| This then became an even bigger pay cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3112)|
| 0:51:57| once I learned the price of health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| I found out I would only be bringing home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| roughly about $700 every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| My wife was not established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| at UT Medical Center yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| That's not even making enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| to cover our daycare expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| which at the time were $300 a week for two kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| We couldn't make ends meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| so we ended up foreclosing on our home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| turning my truck over to the bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| and moving in with my grandparents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| The three of us lived in one big room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| with all our belongings that we owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| We did not have a kitchen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| or bathroom on the floor that we lived in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| This we were willing to sacrifice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| for my desire to be in the career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| and work at Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| This is how I came to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| that I wanted to be a patrolman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| This is how we spent two and a half years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| while I was waiting for my opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| to advance from corrections to patrol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| and then through the academy and FTO program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| Was it worth it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| You better believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| Being a patrolman is my passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| Now I'm a patrolman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| with two years under my belt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| and the struggle with sacrifice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| is ever more present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| We are now in an apartment in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| only because of it being a courtesy officer apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| But to keep ends met with daily bills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| groceries, school dues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| school supplies, after school programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| clothing, car payments, vehicle fuel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| maintenance, repairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| doctor's office co-pays, insurance costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| uniform replacements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| whatever not covered by my allowance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| and basic daily needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| the struggle remains as tough as ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| Do you know what the two-income household| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| to provide for three or more children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| After much research, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| In Knoxville, it's roughly $76,000 to $83,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| for a family of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| But if you remember, I have four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| I have a fourth on the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| so those numbers for me will rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| Unfortunately, between my wife and myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| we do not get anywhere close to that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| So what do I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| I do what most patrolmen do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| I work a side job every single day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| that I'm off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| And I'm sure that I do not need to tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| the impacts of always having to work on a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| I'm here today because I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| it needs to be a priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| to compensate our officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| for not only the daily on-shift sacrifices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| as well as those not seen off-shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| A deputy at such a notorious agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| should not have to worry about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| if the water bill or electric bill was paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| while heading to a dangerous domestic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| How about spending $600 a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| in the hospital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| Or even worse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| receiving a medical dental vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| since you cannot afford a higher deductible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| Or even worse, from personal experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| receiving an email that your wages are goners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| because you couldn't afford the medical bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| from when you broke your nose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| when you broke your nose and had to have surgery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| then heading to a call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| where you watch a man shoot himself in the head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| when you're just trying to offer him help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| How is this okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| The answer is, it's not in the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| These are just some of the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| we are having such a turnover of great deputies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| that we cannot afford to lose any more of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| Our agency is made up of great leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| family, and productivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| We are prideful to wear the badge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| honored to wear this badge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| and we give the ultimate sacrifice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| for our civilians while wearing this badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| I will close with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| Though I am simply a patrolman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| I have so much love for the civilians of my county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| regardless if the feeling is ever mutual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| I will gladly run headfirst| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| into the catastrophic situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| no matter the risk, just for my citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| Every officer on the patrol side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| and the corrections side feel this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| So why not take care of my brothers and sisters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| with the same kind of love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=3349)|

| 1:10:52| approve PR zoning up to three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| because it is consistent with the growth policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| plan and the Northwest County sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| by a vote of 12 to 0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| It's the Knox County Law Director's understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| of the law that currently there exists no growth policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| plan for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| State law required the mayors of the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| the city of Knoxville, and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| to originally adopt the growth policy plan, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| was done by the terms of that growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| It expired December 31, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4290)|
| 1:11:34| Part of the process was the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4294)|
| 1:11:35| was to remain intact and make adjustments and proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| with the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| It was to be reviewed every three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| It's been 19 years since there's been a review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| It's the law director's office advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| and the County Commission passed a resolution to the effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| that with no meeting of the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| there is no existing growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4316)|
| 1:12:00| upon which this commission can review and try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4320)|
| 1:12:04| to comply with and follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4324)|
| 1:12:09| Thank you, Mr. Morton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4329)|
| 1:12:10| Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| I'm going to allow you to speak to this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| and tell us why you think it should be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| And if you can set the timer to begin with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| I'd like to give five minutes to each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| And then if we need to ask more questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| we can do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| Thank you, Chairman Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| I do appreciate the law director's opinion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| I share that opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| And we initially, in this case, had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| asked for up to four dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4358)|
| 1:12:42| despite the rural designation of the growth policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| plan on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4364)|
| 1:12:48| Staff had recommended three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| And after discussion at the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| it was the Planning Commission's unanimous recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| to approve it at the three dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| not the four dwelling units an acre that we had asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| Upon reflection, the applicant is completely fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| with staff and Planning Commission's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| for three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| Kind of takes the whole issue of the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| off the table in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| And I think it's a good compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| from where the applicant originally wanted to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| at four dwelling units an acre, and where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| I think the opposition would like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4403)|
| 1:13:24| to remain at the two and a half dwelling units an acre that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| has been rezoned since 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4407)|
| 1:13:33| This property is in the rural area of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| However, immediately to the west of Harris Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4417)|
| 1:13:41| we have the urban growth boundary, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| So it's one of those properties out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| you see in the 8th District, I think, more than any of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| where you have a pretty sharp line between urban growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4427)|
| 1:13:51| and then right across a street, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| have rural growth without the planned growth buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| being there between them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| And I think that kind of speaks to the evolving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| nature of this area, even back 20 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| when the growth policy plan was first contemplated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| Now, the low-density residential sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| will accommodate five dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| three dwelling units an acre, squarely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| within that contemplation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| We have the hillside overlay on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4456)|
| 1:14:21| And if you factor in those guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| it recommended up to 4.67, just looking at the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| So there's no real hillside issue with the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| that we're requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| This property was rezoned to two and a half dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| an acre in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| A lot's changed since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| We have a new middle school out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| that just came into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| We have schools that are expanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| We have growth in this area, growth all over Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| but we have growth in this area in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| We have new jobs coming into the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| We have a proposed expansion of Washington Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| from the interstate all the way out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| I think, close to Harris Road, if not there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| altogether, which is going to actually allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| there to be more traffic that can flow freely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| I understand traffic is an issue in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4508)|
| 1:15:12| but I've talked to Engineering Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| They've looked at the crash data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| and they don't see anything that's really out of line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| with these roads that would hinder the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4519)|
| 1:15:23| at three dwelling units an acre, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| And I think there's gonna be some anecdotal evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4526)|
| 1:15:28| of crashes, as there would be in any area in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4528)|
| 1:15:33| but we're still here at a rezoning phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| When we go to use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| there'll have to be a full traffic impact analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| We'll have to look at the impact that this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| at its density, will have on the infrastructure and the roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| and we'll have to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4547)|
| 1:15:48| We'll have to do road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| We'll have to partner with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| to improve the traffic flow in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| to open up the Babley Road or Harris or Link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4554)|
| 1:16:00| I think there was, the staff report said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| that all the roads were only 16 feet wide in pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| I don't think that's quite right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| I think Babley and Harris are 18 feet in pavement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| and Link, being a local street, is 16 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| At least it appeared to be that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| when I was doing some measuring this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| So I think there is an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| to further improve the roads here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| to help address the impact that this growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4584)|
| 1:16:28| in this county is having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4588)|
| 1:16:29| And if we don't do it here at just another half acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| half dwelling unit acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| then there's gonna be more subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| that are gonna be pushing out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| trying to find that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| trying to find that place for a need for homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| It's gonna happen whether we want it to or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| So I think we have a piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4603)|
| 1:16:47| it's 106 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| It is relatively flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| It can accommodate the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4612)|
| 1:16:53| Two and a half dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| versus three dwelling units acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| is a grand total of 53 additional homes over 106 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| It's not that significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4621)|
| 1:17:02| In fact, if we were looking at this under smaller tracks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4622)|
| 1:17:05| 10 acre tracks at the same density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| it would seem a lot more palatable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| but the impact is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| And there's really no reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| to not follow staff's professional recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4633)|
| 1:17:16| and follow the Planning Commission's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| unanimous recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| and approve this at the three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| So square line with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| and the growth policy plan for whatever effect that has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4644)|
| 1:17:28| And I respectfully ask that you support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| Planning Commission's recommendation on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4654)|
| 1:17:35| I'll give the opposition five minutes to speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4655)|
| 1:17:40| You'll state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| Thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| My name is Lisa Starbuck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| and I live at 6229 Babley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| In fact, I live about two houses down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| from where this development would take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| In 2007, this development was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| this property was rezoned from agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| to planned residential at two and a half per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| And I would respectfully submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| that the developer purchased this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| knowing what it was zoned for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| I'd like to just mention that the middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4695)|
| 1:18:19| that he referred to as being a change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| that this property is not zoned for that middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| Also, the planned improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4706)|
| 1:18:30| that he's talking about at Washington Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| do not go to Harris Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| They stop at Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4715)|
| 1:18:38| Furthermore, let's talk about these proposed improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4718)|
| 1:18:44| to Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4724)|
| 1:18:45| which is what Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| based their recommendation on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| They're planning to five-lane Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4729)|
| 1:18:52| and I would invite any of you to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| to Babley Road at just about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| most two hours in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| two hours in the afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| and attempt to turn left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4742)|
| 1:19:03| because it's an impossible task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| You take your life into your own hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| because you have to turn against traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| that is coming down Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| The red light stops it at Mill Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| and the Mill Road traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4755)|
| 1:19:16| that's coming from Millertown turns right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4756)|
| 1:19:19| And then the turn lane that's in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4759)|
| 1:19:22| backs up all the way down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| because of people trying to turn left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| So what they're talking about doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4766)|
| 1:19:27| is making it even more dangerous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| where you've gotta go across, now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| three lanes of traffic in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| to avoid the oncoming traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| So that is with the existing traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| And, you know, at shift change at the detention facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| I would also invite you to sit out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| at Babley Road sometime and watch the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4786)|
| 1:19:50| and see for yourself when shift changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4790)|
| 1:19:58| The MPC report does, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| say that the roads are very narrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4800)|
| 1:20:01| and that they're 16 foot wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| They are actually a little wider in places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| but not the entire length of Babley Road or Harris Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| It also neglects to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| that both Harris Road and Link Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| are very narrow, winding, no-shoulder roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| with big, deep ditches on either side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| that go over a ridge to the other side of Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4821)|
| 1:20:25| And so that is very problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| Here tonight, representing a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| that was formed in response to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| the RIDA Planning Advocates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| We had about 80 to 100 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| who met to express their concern about this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4841)|
| 1:20:45| And some of them made the journey here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| and I'd like to ask them to stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| in support of Babley Road to keep this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| at two and a half per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| because we simply, the roads won't handle it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| and Knox County is going to have to spend millions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| on top of what the developer does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| in order to improve these roads to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4863)|
| 1:21:09| It's already zoned for two and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| and they should be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| The property I know for a fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| because I live there, they have to close the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| multiple times when it rains a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| because the water comes off of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4883)|
| 1:21:27| Y'all can sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| Water comes off of this property and floods the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| So the Sheriff's Department has to come out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| and put up fangs and stop it from doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| And where it floods, it floods into a natural spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| that eventually flows into Loves Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| So it has the potential to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| with runoff and all that, to really disrupt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| that natural resource of the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4910)|
| 1:21:55| There's no other changes besides Washington Pike expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| which has been in the planning stages for 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| and it's still in the planning stages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| and it's not going to happen until 2004, 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| If it does happen then, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4927)|
| 1:22:12| As he said, it is on a slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| it's a hillside part of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| it's on the hillside plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| You can say that the developer's got to mitigate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4938)|
| 1:22:21| but you and I both know that water runs downhill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4941)|
| 1:22:24| and there's just no avoiding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| And so it's going to create a big problem there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| I know there's a well right at the edge of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| I've talked to the owner of the property that is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| and right at where the property's going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| and she's very concerned about her well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| Also, Harris Road is misaligned at Babely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4961)|
| 1:22:44| so Harris Road goes like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| So at Babely Road, this is Babely Road going here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4966)|
| 1:22:50| Harris Road does this right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| So that's going to be a big traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4972)|
| 1:22:56| Respectfully, I'd like you to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| ask you to keep the zoning at two and a half per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4980)|
| 1:23:04| Thank you, Ms. Starbuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| Obviously want to give commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4986)|
| 1:23:07| an opportunity to ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4987)|
| 1:23:08| if there are any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4988)|
| 1:23:09| Mr. Mullins, would you like to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| any of the concerns that Ms. Starbuck raised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4991)|
| 1:23:16| Thank you, just briefly, and she's right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| I misspoke, it was Murphy Road for the road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=4998)|
| 1:23:23| With regard to the middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| it was Gibbs Middle School, I believe, that was built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| but it was built in part to relieve the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5006)|
| 1:23:29| on the Holston Middle School that this property is zoned for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5009)|
| 1:23:33| So there was changes there to help accommodate this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| as the growth was being added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5016)|
| 1:23:41| And, you know, yes, roads need to be improved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| all over Knox County, and the county's gonna have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| to spend money to do so, and in order to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| you have to have a tax base that supports the growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5029)|
| 1:23:53| and you need to have opportunities like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| where you have a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| with significant frontage on three roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| that need improving, you have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5039)|
| 1:24:00| to allow a developer, when they develop it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| to help widen the road at that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| to help at these points, to help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| they're gonna have to build sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5046)|
| 1:24:07| in the parental responsibility zone there on Harris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| and there's no sidewalks there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| Now, they won't connect anything yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5052)|
| 1:24:13| but in anticipation of future growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| that's where those connections can start to make an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| It doesn't happen all at once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| it does happen one piece at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| and this is one piece in that puzzle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5062)|
| 1:24:26| And when you're talking about addressing the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5066)|
| 1:24:30| for housing in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5070)|
| 1:24:31| addressing the need for affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| in this community, density matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| You know, I think oftentimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5075)|
| 1:24:36| you'll have applicants stand up here and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| well, they need more density to make the margins work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| and I don't necessarily think that's always true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| but I do think you need more density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| to help keep the prices of homes down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| and that's where that's important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| and if we were trying to see five dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| even, I think, the four dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| was a bit of an ask, but this is a compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5096)|
| 1:24:59| between what we were originally asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| and what it is now at two and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| squarely at three, and we've seen multiple times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5103)|
| 1:25:07| where, in similar circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| three dwelling units an acre is considered the gold standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| for this type of property in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| so it has staff support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| it has their professional opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| outlining why the zoning should be changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| it has unanimous planning commission support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| and with regard to the drainage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| I mean, we have better stormwater regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5127)|
| 1:25:31| and ordinances now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| Director Snowden and his group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| make sure they hold everybody's feet to the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| so that there's not gonna be any more water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| coming off of this property onto the property now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| than there was pre-development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| and in most cases, it actually improves it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| so again, I'd ask you to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| a planning commission and staff's recommendation on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5152)|
| 1:25:52| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5152)|
| 1:25:53| Commissioner Jay, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| Mr. Mullins, at two and a half acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| what is the total number of units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| and then at three, what is the total number of units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| Total, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5165)|
| 1:26:12| At two and a half dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5172)|
| 1:26:13| you're looking at 264 single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| At three dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| you're looking at 317 single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5178)|
| 1:26:22| Thank you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5182)|
| 1:26:26| Washington Pike and Beverly is a pretty big intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5186)|
| 1:26:32| It's a pretty wide open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5192)|
| 1:26:37| Are there any improvements on books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| for that intersection when it comes to turn lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| lights, other ways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| We're often looking at intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| that are really tight, and this one is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| Yeah, as I think Ms. Starbrook mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| the city does have, and their plan to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5213)|
| 1:26:57| that section through there will be five-lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| It's my understanding there's not a traffic signal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| proposed at that location, but one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| as part of, if this development goes through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| we would ask the traffic engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| to look at that intersection to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| if this additional traffic would create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| the need for that signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| So that would be one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| we would task them with, to see if the additional traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| would create the warrant, or the eight-hour volume warrant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5242)|
| 1:27:27| that would be what we would wanna see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5247)|
| 1:27:28| for the traffic signal at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| If it was determined that a signal was needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| who would pay for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| The developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| Is there any way to, can you address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| the concerns about water mitigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5259)|
| 1:27:45| Are you aware of some of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5265)|
| 1:27:46| that were mentioned by Ms. Starbrook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| about flooding and roadways and Sheriff's Office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5268)|
| 1:27:52| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| I was looking at the topography of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| Looks like, right there in front of their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| there's an 18-inch pipe, so there's not that much water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5280)|
| 1:28:03| that drains that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5283)|
| 1:28:04| The majority of the site drains to the west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| and goes into a large 48-inch culvert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| under Babley Road at Harris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| So it looks like the majority of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5293)|
| 1:28:17| drains to the west, and obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| we would require them to meter their post-development flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| so that there would never be an overtopping situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| at that 48-inch pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5307)|
| 1:28:28| And then, finally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5308)|
| 1:28:31| Harris and the intersection at Harris Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5311)|
| 1:28:36| is there any opportunity to address that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5316)|
| 1:28:40| or straighten that, or is that a candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5320)|
| 1:28:43| for a roundabout one day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| We don't often see these sort of half-skewed intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| but every once in a while, we come across them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| Yeah, right now, it's not on our radar screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| Just because I looked at the crash history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| in the last 10 years, there's been a total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| of three crashes at that intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| so obviously, the crash rate is much lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| than what we would anticipate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| But you're right, I mean, that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| a good opportunity for a roundabout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| but right now, the traffic volumes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| just don't really justify, or the traffic volumes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| and the lack of crashes don't justify that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5356)|
| 1:29:17| But if traffic volume were to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| with multiple developments in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| would it get to a point where that could be considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5361)|
| 1:29:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5364)|
| 1:29:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5365)|
| 1:29:26| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| Thank you, Commissioner Jaye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5369)|
| 1:29:30| Are there any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5370)|
| 1:29:33| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5373)|
| 1:29:36| Mr. Mullins, I know you don't have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| a concept plan yet, but did I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| that this entrance and exit is going to be on Babley Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5383)|
| 1:29:48| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5388)|
| 1:29:49| I think if you look at staff's report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| they said that they probably would prefer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| really main access on the link| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| because of its size and narrowness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5395)|
| 1:29:58| It does have a lot of frontage on Babley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5398)|
| 1:30:01| it does have a little bit of frontage on Harris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| I think there's plenty of places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| I know there was a video circulated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| where you drive around, and I drove around it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| several times on Friday, about 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5410)|
| 1:30:15| There are hills at places, but there's plenty of places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| where there's wide stretches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5417)|
| 1:30:18| where you have plenty of sight distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5418)|
| 1:30:19| I think Babley would make the most sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5419)|
| 1:30:23| Whether or not there would be some secondary access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| off of Harris or potentially even Link,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5425)|
| 1:30:28| I don't know the answer to that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| Seems like a development of this size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5430)|
| 1:30:33| usually would have more than one way in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5433)|
| 1:30:37| But I would anticipate the primary one to be on Babley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5437)|
| 1:30:45| I hear what you're saying, Ms. Starbuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| I went out there Sunday afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5448)|
| 1:30:49| and actually drove a couple of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5449)|
| 1:30:52| and trying to make that left turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| from Babley Road onto Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| This was like 3.30 on a Sunday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5458)|
| 1:31:01| I'm here to tell you, both attempts I made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5461)|
| 1:31:04| we were sitting there watching a lot of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5464)|
| 1:31:08| So I thought this sketch I looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5468)|
| 1:31:13| and apparently I did not see it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5473)|
| 1:31:17| Mr. Snowden does not indicate a light there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5477)|
| 1:31:22| at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| I'm looking at a sketch that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| And I'm sorry, ma'am, that's not a county project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5489)|
| 1:31:33| The last time I spoke with city engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| there was, but I may be wrong, but the last time I saw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| There's not a light there and it's a city project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| Oh, I know there's not, but so that's actually city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| And they're not planning on a light there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| I attended a meeting this past Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| with a lot of my neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| and on the Washington Pike rewidening project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5512)|
| 1:31:58| and there was no plan in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| for any kind of addressing the problem at Babley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5521)|
| 1:32:11| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5531)|
| 1:32:12| Ms. Starbuck, there is about two and a half minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| remaining on the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5534)|
| 1:32:15| If anyone would like to speak on behalf of the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| for the remaining two and a half minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| You know, I think we pretty much made our case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5541)|
| 1:32:24| that we really feel like that the developer knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5544)|
| 1:32:28| what the property was zoned for when he bought the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5548)|
| 1:32:32| You know, we compromised back in 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| and agreed to allow the higher density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5555)|
| 1:32:38| and the additional units for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5558)|
| 1:32:44| Quite frankly, the number of houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| that they're planning to build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5567)|
| 1:32:48| we're concerned about what traffic impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| those are gonna have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5571)|
| 1:32:52| A lot of the Sheriff's Department uses Harris Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| as a back way into the detention facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| because, you know, it's very traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5578)|
| 1:33:04| you know, is heavy on Washington Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| and that's really the best way to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| And so there's a lot of traffic on Harris Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| as it is already and Harris Road does this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| and then it goes up over the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5595)|
| 1:33:16| And it's, you know, it's pretty scary at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| I understand there's a lot of bike riders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| for whatever reason on Babeley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| There, it's a scenic area with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5604)|
| 1:33:30| a lot of people, you know, ride bikes on Babeley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5610)|
| 1:33:35| Believe it or not, I would never do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| But anyway, there are people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| and I understand that the Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| trains over there sometimes and does bike rides there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| So anyway, thank you though for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| Thank you, Ms. Talbot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5629)|
| 1:33:53| Seeing no more lights on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| the chair's gonna look to the district commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| for a motion on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5637)|
| 1:33:58| and the chair happens to be the district commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| I've thought about this one a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| and, you know, I can certainly see the arguments both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5644)|
| 1:34:10| There are significant road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| being proposed for Washington Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| and we know they're needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5655)|
| 1:34:20| But I've lived out there my whole life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| and this is what I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5664)|
| 1:34:25| If you live in this area and you're going north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| you're taking Link Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5668)|
| 1:34:29| And if you're going south, you're taking Harris Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| Nobody's taking Babeley Road to Washington Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| that doesn't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| And, you know, my concerns are Harris Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| coming down the ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5680)|
| 1:34:41| the offset intersection of Harris and Babeley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| the width of Link Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5683)|

| 1:34:49| but that is a scary intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5689)|
| 1:34:54| I don't believe there have been significant enough changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| to this area to warrant a change in the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5697)|
| 1:35:00| So I'm gonna move that we deny this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| for any increase in density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5703)|

| 1:38:43| Request that the opposition go first, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| Well, actually, under our rules now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5925)|
| 1:38:47| the applicant has to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| Well, I didn't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| Y'all changed the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5930)|
| 1:38:51| We did, we changed the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| Yes, sir, this is on Brackett Road off of East Emory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| and originally, we had asked for five units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| and we agreed with staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| on four units per acre and we would respectfully request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| from you all approval of the four units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5945)|

| 1:39:13| Brackett Road is off of East Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| East Emory, as y'all probably aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| is being proposed for widening by the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5957)|

| 1:39:29| Thank you, Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5969)|
| 1:39:30| The opposition would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5970)|
| 1:39:35| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5975)|
| 1:39:36| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5976)|
| 1:39:37| My name is Phillip Frills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5977)|
| 1:39:38| I'm at the 6616 Brackett Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5978)|
| 1:39:42| I'm here to represent the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| who reside in the Brackett Road area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5984)|
| 1:39:48| Got a few of them here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| Basically, what we are trying to talk about here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| is some of y'all who have been out to Brackett Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| you've probably seen this is a very, very narrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=5997)|
| 1:40:00| if anything, very, very small road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| The applicant has asked for four homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6003)|
| 1:40:07| We do not feel that it will even accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6007)|
| 1:40:10| up to one home per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| That's basically what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| If you increase it up to the four homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| that they have asked for, you're going to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6017)|
| 1:40:18| for about 1,250 more additional cars on that road per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| As traffic studies have stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| it had been suggested that the roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| were up to 18 to 20 feet at spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| We've measured them up to 16 to 17 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6031)|
| 1:40:36| Where the subdivision is going to be built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6036)|
| 1:40:37| it is not directly going on to Emory Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6037)|
| 1:40:41| so it'll take Brackett Road up to Emory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6041)|
| 1:40:44| or down to the other side on the western side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| down to Bell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| For those of you who have seen that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| those areas are very, very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6050)|
| 1:40:54| in the traffic patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6054)|
| 1:40:57| If you're going from Brackett onto Emory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6057)|
| 1:41:00| turning west, or excuse me, turning east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6060)|
| 1:41:04| you have about a 300-foot view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6064)|
| 1:41:07| as traffic is coming forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| The speed limit in that area has been stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| It is up to 45 miles per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| We feel that is a very unsafe area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6077)|
| 1:41:21| We have provided crash data onto that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6081)|
| 1:41:27| There have been 14 crashes within 600 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6087)|
| 1:41:30| of the Brackett Road-Emory Road intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| since January of 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6092)|
| 1:41:36| There have been 12 crashes directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| at the Bell Road-Emory Road entrances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| So as you can see, there's numerous traffic accidents there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6101)|
| 1:41:45| Also, the property at the corner of Lamy Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6105)|
| 1:41:49| there's a 100-year floodplain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6109)|
| 1:41:51| and is upstream of the floodway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| which empties into Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| It is an increased impermeable area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| where there will certainly increase water discharge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6118)|
| 1:42:01| onto the downstream properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| which I guess the furthest house that would be affected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6123)|
| 1:42:07| that would be Representative Burchett's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6127)|
| 1:42:12| Brackett Road is an agricultural rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| in character, except for about 1,000 feet from Emory Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6135)|
| 1:42:21| which it is very narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6141)|
| 1:42:23| 100% of the property is locally important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| to prime farmland soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| It would be great for the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| to propose to conserve a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| That is farm area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| The concept has been submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6155)|
| 1:42:37| that there is no space, just housing lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| Other areas that we are looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| is the engineering traffic report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| that Mr. Snowden has talked about before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| in discussions with Commissioner Beeler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| and Commissioner Snowden on record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6173)|
| 1:42:55| have stated that Brackett Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| would most likely not support this growth of houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6178)|
| 1:43:03| Like I said, there are numerous safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6183)|
| 1:43:05| Our biggest concern is we're not opposed to growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6185)|
| 1:43:09| If it has to go to one home per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| we understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| We're not wanting to sit here and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6192)|
| 1:43:13| oh no, not in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6193)|
| 1:43:15| No, we will be more than willing to work with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6195)|
| 1:43:17| But we think for the safety of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| that live in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| because that is a very, very small road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6201)|
| 1:43:22| and a very, very dangerous intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6202)|
| 1:43:25| at both Emory and Bell and Emory and Brackett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| that it needs to be improved significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6208)|
| 1:43:32| before any kind of homes can be built in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| We would love to see it denied altogether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| until there are more traffic patterns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| reports done that we could look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6220)|
| 1:43:44| for the safety of that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| But if it has to be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| that's something that the commission feels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| that needs to be performed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6230)|
| 1:43:51| we're fine with going up to one home per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6231)|
| 1:43:56| But I significantly ask each of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| if you can, take the opportunity to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| and drive that road and you'll see how narrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| and how dangerous it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| And we feel that this should be denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6244)|
| 1:44:08| or at least, at the most, one home per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6248)|
| 1:44:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| Thank you, Mr. Friels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6253)|
| 1:44:14| There is one person who signed up for public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| Mr. Davis, did you want to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| to any of Mr. Friels' concerns before we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6259)|
| 1:44:25| Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6265)|
| 1:44:26| We have already done a traffic impact study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| and Brackett Road is 18 to 20 feet wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6268)|
| 1:44:33| and it is striped in the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6273)|
| 1:44:35| And Mr. Stoddard, and I apologize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6275)|
| 1:44:38| I can't remember all these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6278)|
| 1:44:39| when you're striping the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6279)|
| 1:44:40| it has to be a minimum of what width?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6280)|
| 1:44:45| It has to be a minimum of 16 to stripe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| We usually like to have 18 to get the center line on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6287)|
| 1:44:50| Brackett Road is a striped road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| which means it's roughly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| well, the traffic impact study well measured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| it's 18 to 20 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6295)|
| 1:44:57| Also, we're just a few hundred feet from Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6297)|
| 1:45:01| So it's not like there's a long line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| to go down Brackett to get to Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| It's a very, very, very short distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6306)|
| 1:45:07| And also, consistent with the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6307)|
| 1:45:10| there are several subdivisions at and near| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| and further out on Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6313)|
| 1:45:15| that are zoned at a higher density per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6315)|
| 1:45:17| And the four units per acre is consistent with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| It's consistent with what's already been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6320)|
| 1:45:21| down in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6321)|
| 1:45:22| And I understand, and I really do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| I understand where everybody's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| This is part of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| that is starting to see a lot of growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| And it's just like with Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| just like with some of these other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| When you start seeing a lot of new growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6336)|
| 1:45:38| it drives a lot of emotion, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6338)|
| 1:45:42| But the four units per acre that has been recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6342)|
| 1:45:45| and has been approved by NPC is consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6345)|
| 1:45:48| We're a few hundred feet from Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6348)|
| 1:45:50| Emory Road is planned to be widened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| We've agreed also not to do in excess of 68 lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6352)|
| 1:45:56| until there is a west turn lane on Emory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6356)|
| 1:46:00| or eastbound turn lane on Emory Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| just to help mitigate any problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6362)|
| 1:46:04| that anybody may project they're gonna have on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6364)|
| 1:46:08| But Bracket Road, from Bracket Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| where the subdivision entrance is gonna be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6370)|
| 1:46:11| to Emory Road is 18 to 20 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| And it's a, for Knox County, that's a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| I think Emory Road's 22 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| So 18 to 20 foot is, in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6379)|
| 1:46:23| is a pretty good-sized road, and I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| And I appreciate the folks being here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| and I understand the emotion involved with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6388)|
| 1:46:31| But again, I respectfully request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6391)|
| 1:46:32| y'all approve as per recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6394)|
| 1:46:37| Thank you, Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6397)|
| 1:46:38| Commissioner Jay, your light is on, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6401)|
| 1:46:42| Mr. Snowden, can you, or Mr. Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| could you elaborate on the traffic study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| When was that done, and what were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| sort of the highlights of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6408)|
| 1:46:52| I don't think that's in the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| I haven't seen a copy of that, so I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| I haven't reviewed in great detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| but to Scott's point, that study did note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6419)|
| 1:47:03| that the road was 18 to 20 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| I personally went out there and measured it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| in several locations and did determine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| I did see one spot that was 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| Most of the spots I measured were 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6433)|
| 1:47:14| The one spot that was narrow was right at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6434)|
| 1:47:17| there's a culvert crossing there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| so that is something that we would wanna work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6439)|
| 1:47:21| with Mr. Davis on to improve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6441)|
| 1:47:23| because that's the location that would be our main concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6443)|
| 1:47:28| And it's my understanding, and Scott| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6448)|
| 1:47:29| can maybe speak to this, I think TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6449)|
| 1:47:32| has TDOT asked for some additional improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6452)|
| 1:47:34| at Emory, Scott, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6454)|
| 1:47:40| TDOT has recommended, in excess of 68,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6460)|
| 1:47:45| as I understand, that beyond that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| they would recommend an eastbound turn lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6467)|
| 1:47:50| and we have said, we have agreed not to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| in excess of the 68 lots until either we put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6472)|
| 1:47:56| in the turn lane, or TDOT puts in the turn lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| for safety purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| So I wasn't at the meeting when we discussed that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| but I know TDOT had set a lot of threshold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6482)|
| 1:48:05| like Scott was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6485)|
| 1:48:06| That's correct, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6486)|
| 1:48:09| Mr. Murphy, you signed up to speak on this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| so I'll give you your customary five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6491)|
| 1:48:14| if you need it, to address the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6494)|
| 1:48:15| if you'll state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| Thank you, Commissioner Beeler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6498)|
| 1:48:19| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6499)|
| 1:48:21| I'll be about 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| So in this case, the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| and use on review has been submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| and there's a traffic impact analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6508)|
| 1:48:31| The most recent one that is on the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| website is dated September 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6514)|
| 1:48:37| We were a little surprised, because yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| we went out, I know residents went out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| took pictures, tape measured, and found some places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| 17, 16 and a half feet, which is one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6523)|
| 1:48:47| They also remarked that there's a lot of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| that the centerline stripe is not in the center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| of the road, that it varies a little bit on that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| because of pavement width and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6534)|
| 1:48:57| So that's one concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6537)|
| 1:48:58| One of the big issues in the traffic impact analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| that hasn't been brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| it talks about the sight distance at Brackett Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6543)|
| 1:49:06| when you're turning onto Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6546)|
| 1:49:08| And when you're trying to make that left turn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| which is how you get to the schools from there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6550)|
| 1:49:13| the sight distance is, the traffic impact study says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6553)|
| 1:49:16| it's 400 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| The residents kind of measure and think it's more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6558)|
| 1:49:20| on the 300 foot sight distance, but it's tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| The required sight distance is 450 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| And the traffic impact study simply just says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| that there's an inadequate sight distance eastbound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| caused by the existing road profile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6571)|
| 1:49:34| It doesn't talk about the safety implication of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| and it doesn't recommend any mitigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| And that's kind of that, it's hanging out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6578)|
| 1:49:40| It's like everybody knows there's this blind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6580)|
| 1:49:42| you know, this very difficult limited sight distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6582)|
| 1:49:45| and nobody talks about how to improve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6585)|
| 1:49:48| In this case, here you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| Where there would need to be some improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6590)|
| 1:49:52| on Brackett Road, no, and you're asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6592)|
| 1:49:55| when you're asked to do the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6595)|
| 1:49:56| you're asked to say that, yes, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6596)|
| 1:49:58| we think the infrastructure is good enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6598)|
| 1:49:59| or the funding's in place to pay for it in time, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6599)|
| 1:50:02| but it's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| The last thing I know the residents have spoken about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| is there's a lot of rock there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6607)|
| 1:50:09| It's gonna be very expensive to bring wastewater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| and even bring in bigger water lines to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6612)|
| 1:50:15| So it's a really infrastructure intensive project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6615)|
| 1:50:19| which is different than one of those units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6619)|
| 1:50:23| that's at four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6623)|
| 1:50:24| That one has direct access to Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6624)|
| 1:50:27| There's another one that's off of Beeler Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6627)|
| 1:50:30| Beeler Road is a wider road there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6630)|
| 1:50:32| that's at four units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6632)|
| 1:50:33| but other than those two at four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| everything else is three or less in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6635)|
| 1:50:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6640)|
| 1:50:41| Are there any, oh, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6641)|
| 1:50:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6644)|
| 1:50:45| Mr. Snowden, have you all discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6645)|
| 1:50:48| the intersection of Bell Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6648)|
| 1:50:51| And anything that can be done to help with that sight line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6651)|
| 1:50:55| or flashers or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| Bracket and Bell Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6658)|
| 1:50:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| We did a project there a while back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6661)|
| 1:51:04| in consultation with the chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6664)|
| 1:51:06| and we do have the minimum for the posted speed limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6666)|
| 1:51:12| I think we have right at 300 feet of sight distance there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| but it is at the minimum based on our latest project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6676)|
| 1:51:21| Is there any potential for anything to help with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6681)|
| 1:51:24| Regardless of development here or elsewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6684)|
| 1:51:27| it does seem like, because of the angle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| that it comes in and that hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| is there other ways to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| What we did was as most we could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6696)|
| 1:51:37| from the operational perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| It would require a capital project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| with the acquisition of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| And at this point in time, due to the crashes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| that we saw there, it wasn't necessarily justified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6706)|
| 1:51:49| but it would be a bigger capital project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6709)|
| 1:51:58| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6718)|
| 1:51:59| Are there any other questions from the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6719)|
| 1:52:01| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6721)|
| 1:52:02| Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6722)|
| 1:52:08| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6728)|
| 1:52:08| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6728)|
| 1:52:09| Did I hear you say that you agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6729)|
| 1:52:12| to freeze at 68 until improvements were made on Emory Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6732)|
| 1:52:18| Is that what I heard you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6738)|
| 1:52:19| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6739)|
| 1:52:20| Either we would make those improvements ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6740)|
| 1:52:23| and we'll wait for, it's on TDOT's schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| to do by 2024, 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6745)|
| 1:52:29| And you know, sometimes TDOT doesn't always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6749)|
| 1:52:32| go the way we want them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| And so we have agreed to limit the number of lots to 68| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6754)|
| 1:52:39| until that is either done by TDOT or by us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6759)|
| 1:52:43| And so we went ahead and did a traffic impact study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| knowing that some of these issues were gonna come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6767)|
| 1:52:49| So we wanted to be able to address those on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6769)|
| 1:52:52| which we don't, as you know, always do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6772)|
| 1:52:54| But we know that was a sensitive area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6774)|
| 1:52:56| and went ahead and paid to have the traffic impact study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| so we would come with good data for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6778)|
| 1:53:00| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6780)|
| 1:53:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6781)|
| 1:53:02| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6782)|
| 1:53:05| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6785)|
| 1:53:06| Any further questions from the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6786)|
| 1:53:10| Okay, well, I'll look again to the 8th District on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6790)|
| 1:53:14| Again, it's another tough one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| Mr. Davis is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6798)|
| 1:53:19| This is, there is a tension here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6799)|
| 1:53:21| because us folks that have lived out in the Gibbs community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6801)|
| 1:53:26| all our lives, we're used to living in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| And we know there's growth coming and it's uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6809)|
| 1:53:32| And you know, I've driven Brackett Road, gosh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6812)|
| 1:53:37| hundreds of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6817)|
| 1:53:38| I know the road well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6818)|
| 1:53:39| And I know that the intersections at either end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6819)|
| 1:53:43| are kind of dicey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6823)|
| 1:53:43| And Brackett Road's always been single family homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6823)|
| 1:53:47| on big tracts of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| And that's what it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6829)|
| 1:53:50| That's kind of what everybody expects it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6830)|
| 1:53:54| So I really feel like this is an instance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6834)|
| 1:53:58| where I have to be the voice of my constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6838)|
| 1:53:59| And I've been hearing from them since this first started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6839)|
| 1:54:03| And it's very clear to me that their desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6843)|
| 1:54:07| is to see this be approved, if it is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6847)|
| 1:54:11| at no more than one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| So I'm gonna offer a motion to approve this zoning change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6853)|
| 1:54:19| at a density of one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6859)|
| 1:54:25| Just a point of order, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6865)|
| 1:54:27| How does it work if somebody is applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6867)|
| 1:54:30| for a certain density, just from a motion perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6870)|
| 1:54:35| applied at a certain density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6875)|
| 1:54:36| and staff has a certain recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6876)|
| 1:54:38| at a certain density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6878)|
| 1:54:40| Is it just a simple motion to change that number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6880)|
| 1:54:43| that the applicant has requested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6885)|
| 1:54:46| I just wanna make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6886)|
| 1:54:47| I believe we do that fairly routinely, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| We, density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6889)|
| 1:54:54| I mean, I'm pretty sure that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6894)|
| 1:54:58| I'm looking to some of my more experienced commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| So it's not a denial and then a redo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| I don't think it's ever two steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| I think it's one step normally on density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| Commissioner Smith, I recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6907)|
| 1:55:10| This is a piece of land that's not currently zoned, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6910)|
| 1:55:14| Okay, so if a motion's made and seconded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6914)|
| 1:55:18| at one unit an acre and it's voted down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| we're in this case where you have a negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6922)|
| 1:55:26| We would have to vote on something to get to a positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6926)|
| 1:55:29| So it wouldn't be dead after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6929)|
| 1:55:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6932)|
| 1:55:33| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| I was gonna make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6937)|
| 1:55:39| We don't have a second to the original motion yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6939)|
| 1:55:41| Yeah, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| I'll ask for a second to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6945)|
| 1:55:46| Have a second by Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| You're recognized, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| I'm gonna make a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6950)|
| 1:55:52| to four units an acre per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6952)|
| 1:55:59| Motion's been made by, substitute motion's been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6959)|
| 1:56:02| by Commissioner Ward to approve at four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6962)|
| 1:56:09| Second by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6969)|
| 1:56:12| Are there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6974)|
| 1:56:15| Yeah, and staff originally recommended three units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6975)|
| 1:56:20| because that's what the sector plan said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6980)|
| 1:56:25| It is correct that staff recommended three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6985)|
| 1:56:30| It does come, both densities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6990)|
| 1:56:34| the four and the three both comply with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6994)|
| 1:56:37| Okay, and then the property to the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| is also zoned at three units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=6999)|
| 1:56:43| according to your paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7003)|
| 1:56:44| Yes, that's correct. And it's about 35 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7004)|
| 1:56:48| I don't know the, I'd have to measure the exact acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| but yeah, it's up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7010)|
| 1:56:56| The planning commission recommended four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7016)|
| 1:56:59| the staff recommended three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7019)|
| 1:57:01| Is that correct, Mr. Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7021)|
| 1:57:02| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| I'm sorry, my motion is for four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7024)|
| 1:57:06| Correct. To clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7026)|
| 1:57:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7027)|

| 1:57:11| a substitute motion has been made by Commissioner Ward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7031)|
| 1:57:14| to approve this rezoning at a density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7034)|
| 1:57:16| of four dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7036)|
| 1:57:18| and that's been seconded by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7040)|
| 1:57:26| All right, I'll call for the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7046)|
| 1:57:27| All those in favor, please say, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7047)|

| 1:58:18| I want to make a statement here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7098)|
| 1:58:19| Of that area, most houses are three units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7099)|
| 1:58:23| 3 units per acre, and 4 is a little bit too much density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7103)|
| 1:58:29| I think 3 would be a good compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| so I'm going to vote no on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7111)|

| 1:58:50| was at 1 unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7130)|
