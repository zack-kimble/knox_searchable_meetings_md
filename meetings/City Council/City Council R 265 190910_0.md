| 0:02:43| For the Mayor's Report, we have two groundbreakings for very important projects this week I want to remind everyone about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=163)|
| 0:02:51| One is a new park and the other is an affordable housing apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| So tomorrow we'll break ground on the Urban Wilderness Gateway Park, which begins at the end of the James White Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=175)|
| 0:03:02| We'll meet at 4 p.m. tomorrow on Wednesday, September 11th at the Baker Creek Preserve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=182)|
| 0:03:08| not where we were for the budget hearing, but farther back there on Lancaster Drive, 3700 Lancaster Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=188)|
| 0:03:16| That's where the bike park will be built, but this first phase also includes all of the park infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=196)|
| 0:03:22| the utility and road upgrades, and improved community connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| We've engaged with more than 1,000 stakeholders in the last few years to plan for this park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| including residents of South Woodlawn, Old Sevier, Island Home, South Haven, and Lindbergh Forest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=211)|
| 0:03:37| People have told us what they want in that park, what they value, and we've tried to incorporate those elements into the final design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=217)|
| 0:03:45| So please join me and Councilwoman Stephanie Welch, who represents South Knoxville and Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=225)|
| 0:03:53| at 4 p.m. tomorrow, Wednesday, September 11th at the Baker Creek Preserve, 3700 Lancaster Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=233)|
| 0:04:01| Then on Friday, September 13th at 11 a.m., we will break ground on the flats at Pond Gap, which is on Hollywood Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=241)|
| 0:04:11| This is a $22 million affordable rental family housing complex with 102 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=251)|
| 0:04:19| being developed by Elmington Capital Group with city support of $555,000 from the Affordable Rental Development Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=259)|
| 0:04:29| Council knows about this. You approved that money previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| So again, the groundbreaking for the flats at Pond Gap will be at 11 a.m. this Friday, September 13th at 817 Hollywood Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=273)|
| 0:04:41| Lastly, I want to invite all of you to two memorial events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| You have to choose one or the other, actually, being held downtown tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| to commemorate the 18th anniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=289)|
| 0:04:57| City of Knoxville and Knox County officials will host a ceremony at the 9-11 Memorial on the lawn of the City-County Building right out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=297)|
| 0:05:07| Our Police Chief, Eve Thomas, and our Fire Deputy Chief, Gary Compton, will place a wreath at the base of the memorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=307)|
| 0:05:14| The ceremony will begin with a moment of silence at 846 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| as First Baptist Church rings its bells to mark the time hijackers crashed American Airlines Flight 11 into the North Tower of the World Trade Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=319)|
| 0:05:29| Our KPD Chaplain, Pam Neal, will say a prayer, and then retired Captain Mike Friels of the Knox County Sheriff's Office will perform taps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=329)|
| 0:05:37| So Main Street will be closed to traffic between Walnut and Gay Streets from 820 a.m. to 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=337)|
| 0:05:45| And Cats Free Trolleys will cease operation during this time and will resume at 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=345)|
| 0:05:52| Also tomorrow morning, those of us who aren't in front here will be over with many of our first responders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=352)|
| 0:05:59| who will be participating in the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation's 6th Annual Knoxville 9-11 Memorial Stair Climb, which is at the Sun Sphere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=359)|
| 0:06:10| There will also be an inaugural walk-a-thon at World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| As part of the stair climb, 343 area firefighters, EMS personnel, police officers, members of the military,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=374)|
| 0:06:23| and others trained as first responders will climb the equivalent of 110 stories in the Sun Sphere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=383)|
| 0:06:30| in remembrance of the 343 New York City firefighters who died at the Twin Towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=390)|
| 0:06:37| Many climbers will be wearing full gear to replicate the experience of the New York Fire Department firefighters on 9-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=397)|
| 0:06:47| Climbers also wear badges bearing the names and pictures of those fallen firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| As first responders climb, non-emergency personnel will walk a route around the World's Fair Park that equals 110 stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=412)|
| 0:07:01| Proceeds from the climb and the walk go to the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=421)|
| 0:07:07| Chief Sharp and I will be there with others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| It's always a very special and somber event, but we invite people to come to either one of those events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=431)|
| 0:07:19| I'm sure there are probably others in our community as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| That is the end of my report or the reports of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=446)|

| 0:07:35| along with County Commissioner Carson Daly and School Board Representative Christy Christie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=455)|
| 0:07:41| a South Knoxville Community Forum that will be held at South Doyle Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=461)|

| 0:07:55| and for folks to ask questions and just get their questions and concerns answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=475)|

| 0:08:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=508)|

| 0:08:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| 11A is a resolution most respectfully requesting the Knoxville Police Department to explore the cost of acquiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=513)|
| 0:08:39| and maintaining body-worn cameras to be used by those members of the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| who respond to emergency 911 calls and investigate alleged crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=524)|
| 0:08:50| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| We have two people who are signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| Would you like to hear from them first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| First is Mark Taylor, followed by Keith Lyon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| Appreciate both of you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=543)|
| 0:09:10| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| And we'll set the timer up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| My name is Mark Taylor, and my business address is 801 East 5th Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=557)|
| 0:09:26| I am the immediate past president of the Fraternal Order of Police Volunteer Lodge 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| I think I've spoke to most of you at one time or another, and a lot of you many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=571)|
| 0:09:39| Tonight, I want to read, and I don't know if everyone has got to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=579)|
| 0:09:45| We tried to get it out and let folks know where we're at on this issue that's been raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=585)|
| 0:09:51| But I want to just go ahead and read into record a press release that we released on the issue being discussed on body cams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=591)|
| 0:09:59| It's the Volunteer Lodge No. 2 Fraternal Order of Police for immediate release, President Keith Lyon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=599)|
| 0:10:05| Statement from Fraternal Order of Police on body cams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| Officers are perfectly fine with using body cams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| but they desperately need critical manpower shortages addressed to effectively safeguard our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=611)|
| 0:10:18| Knoxville, Tennessee, September 5th, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| The Fraternal Order of Police Volunteer Lodge No. 2 wishes to express its position on the current issue of body cams being discussed locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=621)|
| 0:10:30| Knoxville police officers are honest, dedicated, and hardworking public servants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=630)|
| 0:10:36| who strive to keep the community safe under increasingly difficult conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| They have nothing to hide and welcome the use of body cams as an additional tool to accomplish this mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=642)|
| 0:10:49| Knoxville's police officers are industrious people who use the resources provided to them in innovative ways to keep our city safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=649)|
| 0:10:59| However, to truly address the safety concerns of our community, the conversation needs to be broadened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=659)|
| 0:11:08| to include an impartial assessment of the staffing required to conduct community policing in the modern environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=668)|
| 0:11:17| and an honest evaluation of why many career officers are leaving the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=677)|
| 0:11:23| Body cams are fine tools and can provide valuable perspective and insight into the exceedingly difficult and dangerous job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=683)|
| 0:11:30| Knoxville's police officers perform each day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| If elected officials choose to provide this tool, police officers will embrace its use as they have the current dash cams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=694)|
| 0:11:42| But, the simple fact is, none of these tools are of any use without professional, well-trained police officers to use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=702)|
| 0:11:53| Any time and money spent studying a public safety issue in Knoxville should be prioritized towards the very real and critical issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=713)|

| 0:12:14| in the modern environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| Our citizens and law enforcement professionals deserve nothing less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| Fraternal Order of Police is the world's largest organization of sworn law enforcement officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=741)|
| 0:12:27| Many of you know me, I never read from remarks, so I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| I tried to not lose place there, but I appreciate your consideration of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| Our guys are hardworking, honest people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| We're not adverse to or strangers to accountability or things that create transparency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=759)|
| 0:12:50| but the job's getting harder and harder, and we need help to do it effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=770)|
| 0:12:56| At any point, if there's any questions or anyone wants to further, I'd be happy to discuss with anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=776)|
| 0:13:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| Thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=785)|

| 0:13:15| Keith Lyon, President of Fraternal Order of Police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| As Mark said, we're not opposed to body cams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| If the city decides to use them, then obviously police officers will wear them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| We also have to get rid of this premise that's decades old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| that officers are to blame every time something tragic happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| This decades-old accusation led to the dash cams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| Dash cams proved the officers were right 90 percent of the time, so the issue isn't the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=820)|
| 0:13:45| And actual police officers serve honorably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| In fact, 90 percent of people who go to jail, they do so without a scratch, simply because they do one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=827)|
| 0:13:54| They comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| The problem isn't officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| We don't initiate violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| We respond to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| So criminals do that, so let's just tell it like it is when it comes to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=840)|
| 0:14:06| Body cams give officers 40, you know, it's the next step in coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| It gives about 40 percent more coverage than a dash cam would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| In fact, most people are videoed 40 percent of their day, and the average police officer 80 percent of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| It's the society we live in now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| What we need to do to hit back on what Mark said, we need to work on keeping qualified officers here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=863)|
| 0:14:29| As we speak, a good portion of officers have their applications in at other agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| Knoxville has to be commended for doing some recruiting this past budget year, but we also need to work on retention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=874)|
| 0:14:41| especially with a recruiting number that's down 75 percent across the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=881)|
| 0:14:48| We've already discussed a bidding war earlier this year in city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| 2019 is going to close out with a dozen agencies that are offering $72,000 for lateral transfers to officers with at least 12 years' experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=892)|
| 0:15:02| That's a pretty high tag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| That shows you how low the number is starting to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| Hubert Smith proposed a retention bonus for police officers in a city council campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| I strongly urge members of council to consider such a proposal because we have to start asking ourselves at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=910)|
| 0:15:17| what if the city has to wait on a police officer in an emergency call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| You can't say it hasn't happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| It's already happened in our other first responder services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| There's been at least two accidents that I know of where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| the public had to wait 45 minutes for an ambulance after being injured in a car accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| One of our patrol squads took the injured to the hospital instead of waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=935)|
| 0:15:40| One of our police officers was shot in the line of duty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| and he was taken to the hospital in a police car with a firefighter administering first aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| He understands that shortage better than anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| Just like dash cams, body cams will prove the police department is right 90 percent of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=954)|
| 0:16:00| Like I said, it's the same argument, different decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| It's not going to be wrong once in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| That's just the human element of things, but the price for being wrong for us is pretty high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| And also, police officers, not just here, would pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| It usually affects police officers across the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| But here, there's plenty of mechanisms in place to make sure that the police do their job correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| I urge you to make staffing a priority as much as body cam or issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| because, after all, if you were the one that has to dial 911, what would that feel like if you had to wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=986)|
| 0:16:31| One of our police officers already know that in the most dramatic way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| Councilman Stare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| I think you all signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| Did you want to speak now instead of at public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| Could I just say something like 30 seconds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| I mean, tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| Do you want to sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Are you signing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| If I speak now, I can't do it at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| You can actually do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| So go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| State your name and address for the record and go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| Noah Nordstrom, 1605 Washington Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| So I just wanted to quickly respond to what they were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| If dash cams prove that officers are right 90% of the time, then why haven't we seen dash cam footage of what happened to Philly Feep?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1037)|
| 0:17:25| We want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| We do want to see that footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| Because we're expected to be sympathetic with this police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| But why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| There's two bullets in the back of Philly's head, and that officer is free and he's on paid leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| So why should we expect that the police officer did the right thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| All we know is that someone died and that the police did it, and they haven't released the footage to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1061)|
| 0:17:47| So the police are here saying that cams show the police are right all the time, and that's just not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| And if it were true, they would be releasing the footage to us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| That's all I'm going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| Okay, but let me clarify something there, because I suggest for the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1078)|
| 0:18:04| it is the DA who decides when everything is released, not KPD, not the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1084)|
| 0:18:11| and she decides that based on completion of her investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| Or she can decide, I guess, when she chooses to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| So it is not the police department or the officers or this administration or the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1100)|
| 0:18:26| that is holding it back, just so you understand how the process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| All of that is required to be given to the district attorney general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1109)|
| 0:18:35| She reviews the case and then decides when, whether there's criminal activity or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1115)|
| 0:18:42| or whether the officer is exonerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| She then decides when everything gets released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| So I want you to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| Nobody is holding anything back from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| It's part of an investigation, and this is the normal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| You know, I brought this forward because I thought it was important to get this issue out in front of this council and the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1144)|
| 0:19:11| And I want to thank Mr. Lyons and Mr. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| I certainly agree with your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| These cameras are certainly not a replacement for training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| which is the most important thing on dealing with these issues, and staffing levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1162)|
| 0:19:28| But they are a tool, and I just see it as an expectation that the public has now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1168)|
| 0:19:35| A number of law enforcement agencies across the country have them, that technology is improving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1175)|
| 0:19:42| And it's one, another piece of evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| And I talked with people at the Sheriff's Department who have them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| and they said, you know, a lot of times they're very helpful in defending cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| They had somebody complain about treatment, and they sent them the video of how the officer treated them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| and the guy ended up apologizing to the Sheriff's Department, didn't realize how bad he was behaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1200)|
| 0:20:07| So, you know, I think it's an important step in building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| And it's up to us as council to help this bridge between law enforcement and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1212)|
| 0:20:18| It's a fragile relationship, and I think this is an important step forward on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1218)|
| 0:20:25| And, you know, this information might already be available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| and, you know, I look forward to working with the administration on the next steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| you know, in the last few months I have on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| The next council, I think, you know, we'll be building next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| It's something to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| So thank you for the support on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| Councilwoman McKenzie, you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| I just want to comment on what was shared by the officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1254)|
| 0:21:00| that 90% of the time the officers' actions are appropriate and correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1260)|
| 0:21:07| But there's that 10%, and this is where the body cams will come into play to either exonerate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| and confirm that the officer did the right thing and acted appropriately or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1272)|
| 0:21:20| Thank you for challenging us as it relates to staffing and retention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| because those are excellent points that I think will resonate with all of us as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1284)|
| 0:21:30| And so the body cams is just one step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| and I will commit to giving you attention to the staffing as well as the retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1293)|
| 0:21:40| and helping you guys move forward because we want a safe community and a safe city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| not just for the residents but for those of you who pledge to protect and serve us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| and we certainly appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| I'm generally sympathetic to this, but I would like to hear from the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| what I suspect you all might have looked into this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| Yeah, let me first, you know, I shared a statement with council that we had given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1325)|
| 0:22:12| when asked by the press about the resolution, and I'll just read from it to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1332)|
| 0:22:18| We welcome City Council's resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| Over the last year, we have actually, we started looking into this years ago when Chief Roush was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1341)|
| 0:22:28| As somebody just said, the technology has changed a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| and the Chief will talk about that in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| But we started having conversations about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| and even last June I sat down with the Chief and with Julia Small to talk about the dash cams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1356)|
| 0:22:43| and how we are updating them and then the potential for body cameras as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| But what happened is over the last year, we've been evaluating new technology for our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| We have now transitioned to new laptops with FirstNet capability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| that increase our ability to upload large amounts of data directly with priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1378)|
| 0:23:05| We have been evaluating advanced in-car dash cameras and two patrol vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| and last week ordered two body-worn cameras, which have arrived,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| to begin their evaluation along with the in-car cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| We look forward to sharing with Council and the community and our police force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| the results of that evaluation and the costs associated with the technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| I know in your resolution, you're asking for a recommendation by January 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| We anticipate having something much sooner on my watch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| bringing back a recommendation for the purchase of body cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| and with a budget amendment to accommodate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| I'm supportive of this measure, and I really appreciate everyone who's come to talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1431)|
| 0:23:58| especially the past and current fraternal police presidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| One thing that I had thought about with this is how this would impact our community policing model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1444)|
| 0:24:13| Mr. Lyon, I don't know if you or Mr. Taylor wanted to maybe answer some questions I might have about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1453)|
| 0:24:24| One thing I was thinking about is when the camera's being in use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1464)|
| 0:24:32| and you probably have folks that come up and want to tell you something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| but when they know they're on camera, they may not want to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| because they may want to stay anonymous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| So that was one thing I wanted to ask you about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| if you think that would affect the community policing model that we use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| And then also, what happens when you're called to come into somebody's home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| I would assume that the camera would continue to run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| so it seems like there might be some privacy issues there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| So I don't know if you can talk to us maybe about those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| and then in general about how this might affect the community policing model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| I'm happy to try and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| I'll qualify this first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| I'm not a policy guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| I'm a troop, but I'll tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1514)|
| 0:25:20| I am a heartfelt believer in the concept of community policing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1520)|
| 0:25:26| and I believe that that is the only way to conduct policing in America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1526)|
| 0:25:33| and it should be the only way to conduct business anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| So to your question, I don't think anybody likes being recorded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| especially if it's, you know, I mean, in general, it's just not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| you've got to like watch your P's and Q's, you've got to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| I don't think citizens like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| I think people, what we've seen with the in-car cameras is cops are fine with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| They realize that it wasn't something that was hurting them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| that it was actually helping them in most cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| and there are cases absolutely where we've got people around the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| and even locally that have done things that they shouldn't be doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| and, you know, we don't need those people, you know, on those offenses and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| So that is a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| But as far as the community policing thing and the body cam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| the one thing with the car that I see, so if I'm out on a call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| or I'm out in the community talking to people, there are folks that still help us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| I don't know if it seems like it's much to me, maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| and the environment's a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| Everybody's in a hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| Things are hectic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| There's too much stuff to do, honestly, for what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| But so from an in-car perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| it's fairly easy to step off to the side and talk to someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1609)|
| 0:26:55| and, you know, you're not going to get their face blasted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| I see potential there for that to maybe be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| We'll have to look at or maybe have a policy on how we handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| if someone wants to give us information and maintain confidentiality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| because there's people that give us information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| and they absolutely want to remain confidential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| I don't say that as a ploy to not have body cameras or to dissuade you from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1633)|
| 0:27:21| I'm just saying that I think that's a potential concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| especially some of the type of work I do and stuff and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| And there are probably benefits to it as well on both sides of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| On the aspect of community policing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| what is most important to that from a practitioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| or on-the-ground perspective, in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| is time to build relationships, which equals trust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1666)|
| 0:27:54| which gives you information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| which allows you to address the needs of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| The community doesn't know you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| You don't have the time to talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| You can't build a relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| They're not going to trust you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| and you're going to have a reduced amount of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| And, honestly, you're going to be a reduced amount effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| in order to actually do community policing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| in order to be partners with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| And as I go back, that's one of the things I loved about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| The time and the availability and the manpower and the resources to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| in my mind, is a critical component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| regardless of what pieces of equipment that we wear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| I think our guys will adapt to whatever our elected officials decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| What we can't make up for is, you know, staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| And the job has got so much more complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| And I'll tell you, from the time I come on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| with the mental health issues, the addiction issues, just down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1734)|
| 0:29:00| And, honestly, there's, I believe, a loosening in some of the social fabrics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| how people feel about laws and stuff like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| and society's going to have to have some conversations about that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| I think community policing is absolutely the way to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| but it's labor-intensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| It requires time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| It requires resources and manpower and personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| And now we kind of do, I'd almost call it a corporate community policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1762)|
| 0:29:30| We work with providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| and we try to leverage the manpower we have and the resources we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| to get the most bang for the buck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| And those are great things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| but that does not and cannot and will not ever replace the building block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1780)|
| 0:29:46| the foundation of patrol officers in your community that the residents know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1786)|
| 0:29:54| that they build relationships with, that they come to trust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| and that they can rely on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| And then, as a community, we grow together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| And we say the community, and we say police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| I am the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| I live in Councilman Ryder's district, and I'm happy to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1808)|
| 0:30:15| I'm proud to be a Knoxvillean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| And, you know, so we're the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| But there's a lot of growing hostility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| People are a little frustrated with government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| You know, I caught that in the news,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| and things are a little crazy all over, and everybody's short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| But it's critical that we invest and that we capture back what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| Honestly, I wasn't big fans of the guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| but what Victor Ashe and Phil Keefe did, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| as far as looking at and providing resources and staffing and coming up with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1845)|
| 0:30:53| it was huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| I didn't like a lot of decisions they made, but I loved the concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| And I hope we have a conversation and maybe work back towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| Did that answer your question, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| I'd like the Chief to be able to talk about that, because one of the issues is privacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| and that's something that's been discussed for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| And with the technology change, there's also new opportunities to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| So, Chief, you want to talk some about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| And that's part of what we're looking into is policy for the body cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| And we have some organizations who are CALEA accredited that we have requested policies from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1886)|
| 0:31:32| that are very good policies who have both the body and the in-car cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| One of the things that the new technology allows for us to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| and that we're looking at is redaction within that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| So if we go into a house and there are children in the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| we can redact out those faces in that actual program before we send it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| Basically blurs them or something, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| It blurs or puts black over either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| So that's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| Cloud storage is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| The technology has really improved, so as we need to redact these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| we have the ability to do that, and unlimited data is now available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| So that was another issue that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| and being able to export our video directly to the cloud with that unlimited data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| so we don't have to come back to our building and hit a data point to download that video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| It immediately goes up, which helps with chain of custody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| So we're never taking a memory card out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| There's nobody who touches that video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| It automatically goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| So those are some of the technology issues that we're really looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| and they are now available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| Right, and I really appreciate that, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| I'm an advocate for community policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| I think everyone up here is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| One thing I wanted to make sure we had in this discussion was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| could we have some impacts that, you know, we need to look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| Because we don't want people to not come talk to the officers that arrive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| or give tips about things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| or, you know, you make a report about something that's going on around your house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| and all of a sudden, you know, everything that's going on in your house is public knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| So I really appreciate you looking into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| and answering that for us today on that policy front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| Officer Lyon, did you want to add anything about community policing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| You're good? Okay. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| Okay, Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| One of the common threads that I'm hearing is that everybody's in support of the body cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| just it's not going to fix everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| Different people are coming at it from different ways, and it's not going to fix anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| It's going to record some things, and it may answer some questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| but it doesn't change how things are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| As Mr. Taylor was saying, society has changed a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| There aren't people applying to become police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| We can't take just anybody because we need police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| There needs to be some changes in how we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| You know, I keep saying, and we've had so many conversations about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| we need people out there that are social workers, that can deal with the mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| That is not what the police were trained for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| They need more training, but that's not what they came in for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| and that's not their expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| So I think we do need to have more discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| We need to look at how the model is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| You know, there's so many stories right now in the newspaper about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| Knoxville Police Department and the sheriffs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| that I think we need to have quite a few conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| You know, there's a cultural thing that seems to be going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| and that causes some of the rift between the community and the police department as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| And I'd like to see that rift be gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| but it means some good, hard conversations beyond just a camera| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| and just hiring more cops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| Let me also add that part through the Save Our Sons initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| and through PARCC and our Safe Neighborhoods initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| through the Office of Neighborhoods, we are having those kinds of conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| and we need to continue to have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| But we've had a series of those, and there's another one coming up at Beck Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| When is that, Avis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| It's this coming Tuesday at Beck Center at 6 o'clock p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| But exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| We need those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2127)|
| 0:35:28| We're having them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| We need more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| We need to continue to have them to try and address the gaps that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2130)|
| 0:35:37| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| Well, I agree with a lot of what my colleagues have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| but particularly what Councilwoman Singh said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| Let me start by saying I can't do my job without you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2148)|
| 0:35:54| Most of what my community asks for are more police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| They want more frequent patrols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| They want their liaison officers there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| The liaison officer program has been fabulous for our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| It is a manpower thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| We've had officers that show up on their time off to do that and build relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2168)|
| 0:36:14| They Facebook with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| They text with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| They show up on their vacation days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| It has been amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| And we know each other as people, and we understand each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| and what our issues and our hot-button things are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| And the trust and rapport has been wonderful, particularly for our urban neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2188)|
| 0:36:36| But, you know, some of my frustrations lately have been things that end up we're asking our officers the shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2196)|
| 0:36:45| I'm kind of babbling about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| but a lot of what the demands are being put on me of why can't you send more police officers is they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| They're social work issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| And I'm asking these guys to be social workers and mental health care providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| and that's not their fault, and it's not the mentally ill's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| It's the fact that we as a society have let these folks down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| and I can stand here and stump on this for half an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| I feel incredibly frustrated as a council person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| and I've had multiple meetings lately where I'm like I feel powerless to respond to the things that my constituents are asking for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2236)|
| 0:37:24| because we don't have the resources, the deep enough pockets to address these societal issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| that have gotten so extreme and so deep that probably while I'm sitting here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| I'm getting more Facebook messages or emails or maybe some texts to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| Lauren, I'm fed up with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| We need the police to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| We need somebody to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| We need more housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| We need more mental health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| And these guys can't do all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| They can only respond to the results of those symptoms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| and we're not treating those underlying issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| So I hear you when you say we're having those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| What I say is that we need more of those conversations, more frequently, more just we're coming from a rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2281)|
| 0:38:09| We're addressing it when we're too far deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| And so I guess I'm voicing my frustration at constantly when, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2291)|
| 0:38:19| somebody from the police department like Captain Willis calls and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| Lauren, how can we help you address this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| And I'm like, you know, to be honest, I really feel that you can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| because I'm asking you to make up for all the other areas that didn't get funded like mental health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2308)|
| 0:38:34| So what I want from you guys and what I am supporting this resolution is I want you guys to have the tools to do your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2314)|
| 0:38:44| And, you know, I know you guys aren't perfect all the time, and I wish you were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| I wish we all were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| But anyway, so I hope that you guys will come back with good information for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| and we can do what you guys need to do your job and we can, as a community, improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| One last comment, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| I would be remiss if I didn't address the term community policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| When I campaigned, I campaigned on community policing as a point for residents to take ownership of their communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2354)|
| 0:39:21| and their neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| And not all residents and not all communities participate in organized neighborhood organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2363)|
| 0:39:31| And so when we are trying to build trust with the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| and there are some areas in our community and in our city when a neighbor sees a police car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| or two or three police cars and sometimes there are five or six police cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| that show up in certain neighborhoods in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| the first thing that residents do are take out their cell phones and cameras to start videotaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| because there is that lack of trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| And I just want to be very clear that we still have areas in our city and in our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2395)|
| 0:40:01| that there is a huge divide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| And if body cameras will help to, you know, strengthen relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2404)|
| 0:40:11| and narrow that divide because of transparency and making people feel more comfortable that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2411)|
| 0:40:16| regardless of the interaction, that it will be transparent because it is recorded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| that's one of the main reasons that I am in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| And then also continuing in patrolling in those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| but maybe not as four or five police cars showing up when it's just a simple call that's out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2428)|
| 0:40:35| to make people feel a little bit more better about the relationships with our police force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2435)|
| 0:40:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2443)|
| 0:40:44| Did you want to respond to that, Mark, specifically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| Hold on just a second, Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| Come on down, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2449)|
| 0:40:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| Councilwoman, that's exactly what you just said is exactly why we have to invest in, in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2461)|
| 0:41:09| humbly from doing this job for 20-some-plus years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| why we have to invest in and build back that strength and capacity to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| because, like you said, you know, the cameras will increase transparency and this and that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2478)|
| 0:41:24| but what we want is a relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| We want a true and an honest relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| And, you know, in order to do that, it takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2491)|
| 0:41:38| And honestly, you have to manage your personnel because some people are more comfortable in their own skins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2498)|
| 0:41:46| It takes a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| Listen, it takes like six months to go through a hiring process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| It takes a year to train a police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| And then when they get out there, I didn't know what I was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| Almost every perception I had about police work was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| And I'd spent seven years active in the military and was an NCO and led troops in a combat arms division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2523)|
| 0:42:12| intel unit, and a special forces troop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| So, you know, I thought I knew something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| I've been around the world a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| And most of the views I had about police work were absolutely wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| I didn't know jack about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| And so you've got to get out there and you've got to have the time and you've got to know folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2548)|
| 0:42:35| It takes about 18 months to train them, but really it takes about five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2555)|
| 0:42:42| because what you do is you take anybody and you put that much responsibility on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| And let's make no mistake, you know, cops may not agree with what they have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| Half the time I've had to arrest people that I didn't want to arrest, but I absolutely had to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| I felt horrible about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| I went back and bought people groceries, his wife groceries, after I've had to take a guy to jail from Walter P. Taylor Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2580)|
| 0:43:07| I love that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| And I spent as much time there, more time there than I did at my own home for probably seven or eight years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| until I shipped over to Iraq.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| But you've got to have the ability to stop and have the time to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2597)|
| 0:43:23| and you've got to hang on to people and build that capacity to police in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| And, you know, so that's my, I guess, my thing on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| We've got to stop the loss of people that we've invested training dollars in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| and we've got to get to where they have the discretionary time because it takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| And especially if the relationship's fractured, it takes more time to build that trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2623)|
| 0:43:48| It's a slow process, but it's worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| It's worth every bit of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| It'll pay off hand over fist in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| It'll help solve some of the housing problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| It'll help solve some of the drug problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| It'll help us be more effective in utilizing the resources to address the real problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2641)|
| 0:44:06| that are driving violence and those things in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| And then those communities can grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| Then investment will work better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| But you've got to have that basic safety, and it's a big investment in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2655)|
| 0:44:21| I agree with everything you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| We're all in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| It's just hard to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| And the critical building block and element of that is our patrol force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2668)|
| 0:44:34| It's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| An investigator comes out, and we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| But the critical part of it is building that capacity in the folks that answer your calls day in and day out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2678)|
| 0:44:44| And then when I show up, those guys can say, hey, this is Investigator Taylor, and he's a good guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2684)|
| 0:44:50| And they have that faith and that confidence and relationship to where those people will trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| I don't have to maybe start from zero trying to build that, and that's efficient and effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| But that starts at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| And right now, I mean, and for a while, we've just been running, running, running, running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| Those guys have been running, running, running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| And when you do that, those guys are tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| They're stressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| We have a high rate of mental health issue in our own profession because of different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| compassion fatigue and the stress of the job and the constant, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2721)|
| 0:45:26| need to try to solve people's problems that you can't even solve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2726)|
| 0:45:33| And so our guy shows up there, ran short or gal, stressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2733)|
| 0:45:39| The person we're going to assist is stressed because they've called the police not because they're in a good shape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| or because they've got the barbecue ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| They called the police because they're in need and something bad has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| And that impacts their lives, and it takes us maybe longer than we'd like to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| And then our guys or gals are stressed, and then they're stressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| That's not a good mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| We've got to get back away from that and build capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| I'm all in with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| I think our guys are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| I've seen us do it before, and I know our people's hearts there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| It's just got to, I mean, we've got to have some help to get back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| Chief Thomas, we've been talking about community policing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| and we've all been giving our opinions on what we think needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| How do you envision what do you need to help the police department move forward in a better way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2790)|
| 0:46:38| safer for the public and for themselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| Pretty simply, all of the above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| I think everybody has made great points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| You know, we need time to work with our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| We're doing that as best we can right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| The liaison officer program is a great program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| and we do have officers who do things on their own time because they care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| I got an e-mail today about a CIT officer who is trying to get one of her people that she checks on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| a caseworker, and there's none available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| and she knows this gentleman has Alzheimer's and needs to have interaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| She's picking him up on her own time and taking him to different functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| and hadn't told anybody, somebody just noticed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| So we are a group of people who really care about our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| It is tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2847)|
| 0:47:28| It's tough across the nation to get people to become police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| If you gave me a salary of $150,000 per officer right now, I would still have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2851)|
| 0:47:37| It's a high-risk job right now, and it's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| So we want to make it as palatable as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| We want to show that we have good training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| So, you know, it's all of the above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| It's good training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| It's working with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| Community policing boils down to two things, partnerships and problem solving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| That's all it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| And so, you know, body cameras are a tool, as we've all heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| It's a tool that will help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| We need other tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| We need personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| We need other things as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| So, you know, we're open to this tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| It's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| Wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| I'm also very frustrated by not knowing what's going on with both the cases that are being investigated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2891)|
| 0:48:18| the Maxwell case and Mr. Peebs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| So I'm waiting for those answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| The idea of 90%, is it good enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2905)|
| 0:48:31| That means 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| You know, that's 10 out of 100 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| Can I speak to that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| Because I'm not sure where that number came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| I don't know if that's industry-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| I don't know if that's our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| I would like to go back and say I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| But any percent is difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| More of my point is when we say a bad apple, a few bad apples, we can't have bad apples in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2930)|
| 0:48:57| and we can't protect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| I am so, like, one of the reasons I'm waiting for the results to come back is I think Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2939)|
| 0:49:05| Officer Braswell, I believe that's his name, was a hero to do something that was different from that culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2945)|
| 0:49:11| to speak out when there's that blue line and that code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| We can't have those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| We have to all take care of each other and be brave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| Don't do the same old thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| That's what's gotten us into this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| And I apologize I can't speak to that investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| But everything that he has brought up is being investigated, and those results will come clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2971)|
| 0:49:38| Whether we've done the right thing or not, it will come clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| Mr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| Can I speak on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| That's a nationwide Fraternal Order of Police estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| Naturally, it's an estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| So number for number, you know, there's always plus or minus marginaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| But, you know, also don't forget police work is a human profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| You know, there isn't any profession that's going to have people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| It would be nice if we could, if we could have people doing everything right 100% of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3004)|
| 0:50:09| It's just not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| But up there around 90% is higher than most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| And every time somebody does something wrong, they don't stay in the profession long because it tends to be found out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3014)|
| 0:50:22| especially in today's time because you can't go through your day without being recorded somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| You know, you're probably recorded at least 40% of your day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| You're an average person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| Ours is longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| Those things get taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| And inside the city, we have at least three reporting mechanisms that when an officer does something incorrect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3038)|
| 0:50:44| they can go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| It's park, it's internal affairs, and also the officer supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3045)|
| 0:50:50| And those reports get made a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| And there's also tons of false accusations against the police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| And half the time, the officers don't even know the accusation's being made because supervisor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| internal affairs, or whoever the case may be, or even park, they can go get a copy of the in-car video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3062)|
| 0:51:08| Then they can find out, well, this person's mad about a ticket and, you know, that's all they're upset about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3068)|
| 0:51:14| The officer didn't do anything wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| Something that's not reported a lot is how many times an officer's complained on and he's found to be justified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| That's the things that people don't talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| You know, obviously it's going to make the news when the officer is wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| but we don't get far enough credit for being right, and that happens just about every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3087)|
| 0:51:33| Like I say, when it comes to an issue of use of force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| a majority of 12, 25 people get in a wagon at one point in time during a 24-hour cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3096)|
| 0:51:42| and they go right to the intake without a scratch because they comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3102)|
| 0:51:47| You know, that's not us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| That's them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3108)|
| 0:51:49| You know, we respond to a lot of the decisions the public makes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| You know, we don't initiate a lot compared to what we respond to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| I'm wondering what you have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| One of the things that I think hasn't been spoken and is heavy in this room is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| how about the different ways that different races are responded to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| We treat people the same across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| Now, there are some times, like say, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| if we go in a community that may have an immigrant, predominantly immigrant community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3137)|
| 0:52:22| we try to use a lot of resources to accommodate them because there is a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3142)|
| 0:52:31| I forget the name of the language, from Africa that gets spoken in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3151)|
| 0:52:38| We have to call somebody to come out and translate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| You know, there's people from the eastern block of Europe, the Balkans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| We have to call people to translate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| Chinese, you know, we do have at least one Chinese-speaking officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| But we always make accommodations because our job is to assist them in their problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| and help that person when they go to the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3178)|
| 0:53:04| I could go on for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| But basically, different races are treated differently as far as violence perpetrated on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3185)|
| 0:53:11| or back and forth or just we see darker people as more dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| It's not that I'm saying anybody is racist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| It's something that exists within us, and we've learned this year after year of this culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| teaching us that black men, even if they're 14 years old, look dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| And it's not, it's very visible to see how people of different races have been treated differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3208)|
| 0:53:36| And I'm not saying it's done on purpose, but it needs to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| It's implicit bias.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| We just make those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| The first step to that is awareness and admitting that we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| And that's very hard to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| but I think that's one of the first places we need to start with the police department with this culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| Well, our job is to enforce the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| It has nothing to do with culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| You know, a crime is a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| It doesn't mean that you treat somebody differently just because of where they come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| I don't think that it's done on purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3245)|
| 0:54:06| Let me just, implicit bias training and such, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3246)|
| 0:54:12| And I think the Chief and Alice Reed can both speak to that in terms of what we do in our trainings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3252)|
| 0:54:19| both with the recruits and the in-service training about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| Do you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| One of the things that we do with the Police Advisory Review Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| is really focus on making sure that officers have an opportunity to have dialogue with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3268)|
| 0:54:37| from various cultures prior to becoming officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| One of the things that we say is that each one of us have different experiences based on where we were raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3282)|
| 0:54:55| you know, who we hang with, all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| And unfortunately, when officers interact with citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3298)|
| 0:55:04| they will be interacting with people whose cultures are different from theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3304)|
| 0:55:10| And so we do this training up front to give them an opportunity to really have serious dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3310)|
| 0:55:18| and understanding of how certain things could be misinterpreted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| simply because you don't have those experiences and knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| So that training is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| And we're so glad that we've had so many citizens who are comfortable coming and sharing their culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3331)|
| 0:55:39| sharing their experiences, sharing their expectations prior to the recruits becoming officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3339)|
| 0:55:51| And I agree wholeheartedly with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| The more we can offer our recruits this experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| because what we're finding is our young people now don't have a lot of life experience when they come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| I mean, they have problems talking to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| So we have to teach them that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| So this training is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| We realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| But we also realize that when we interact with different people who are different than us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| we're not seeing them on their best day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| They're not receptive to us the way we might like for them to be receptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| And so sometimes those interactions are not good simply because it's a bad situation to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3379)|
| 0:56:25| We do our best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| Sometimes it's not good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| But we keep trying and we keep learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| And we can never have enough training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| I'll never tell you we have enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| We're always trying to improve and do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| So that's why it's so important, the relationship we have with PARCC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| That's very important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| I want to also add that this is not just with the police force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| I think implicit bias can affect people in every single department and every aspect of our lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3404)|
| 0:56:50| and in the corporate world as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| So that's why we have an equity committee among our staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3412)|
| 0:56:57| and we recently had a day-long training on racial equity that addressed all kinds of issues, as you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3417)|
| 0:57:05| thinking about how even a city policy, city programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| are we thinking through what might be institutional racism that we're not aware of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| You know, how accessible are programs to different people and such?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3434)|
| 0:57:20| So it's an important issue, not just for police, but for all of our departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| and it's something that we do address and we need to continue to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3444)|
| 0:57:29| And you can't do it one time and then say you've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| You know, it's got to be a lifelong commitment to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3452)|
| 0:57:38| And I think year after year after year, with your staff and service and your staff trainings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3458)|
| 0:57:44| you have to be focused on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| Do you have any more questions for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| I don't think right now, but don't go far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| Okay, I'm going to ‑‑we're kind of suspending the way we do things right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3472)|
| 0:57:56| Let me go ahead and let Mr. Roach speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| I'll sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| We've got to mix up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3480)|
| 0:58:01| Go ahead, Mr. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| Rick Roach, 2404 Victoria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| Everyone has made correct points here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3486)|
| 0:58:11| Except when I hear 90%, 10% tagging on what you said, tagging on what you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3491)|
| 0:58:19| that 10% usually ends up being a deadly situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3499)|
| 0:58:24| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| So we can't minimize the effect on human life, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| Now to say that we have a problem, you're understaffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3512)|
| 0:58:40| How many officers approximately do you need if you had your wishes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3520)|
| 0:58:45| How many officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| I'm authorized to 416 right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| I'm at 374 as of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| However, in 2004, we were authorized to 446.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3531)|
| 0:58:57| Whew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| Being that as it is and given the makeup, okay, this isn't just a police problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| This isn't just about policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| This is about community formation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3553)|
| 0:59:14| You were correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| Yeah, it goes to other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| It does go to other areas, and it's all connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| They are dealing with the results of things that have not necessarily gone well in other areas of life in Knoxville and in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3560)|
| 0:59:31| So we have to start truly focusing on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| If we are denying any community, any geographical area within the city limits of Knoxville the opportunity to live the best life, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3575)|
| 0:59:47| and if you put one area on the back burner, if you don't pay attention and if you don't value that one particular area in Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3587)|
| 1:00:00| then that is a community, as we all well know, that is a community that is being underserved and where you have problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3600)|
| 1:00:12| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| I've lived in communities like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3615)|
| 1:00:22| It's not rocket science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| It's about the will and the want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3626)|
| 1:00:30| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| If you don't value a particular area of Knoxville, say so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| Write them off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| Write them off and just say, hey, you know, and we'll let drugs come flowing in, okay, and we'll police you differently, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3635)|
| 1:00:45| than the other areas of Knoxville that have a similar problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| Oh, and when you do have those problems, it's a criminal problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| But over in another part of Knoxville, it's a, oh, rehab problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3656)|
| 1:01:04| See where I'm coming from on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| Okay, so we have to change attitudes here, and we have to change them quickly and open our eyes and admit to what is really going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3666)|
| 1:01:15| Again, my son is law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| When he put that gun on his hip, okay, he has a certain amount of responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3681)|
| 1:01:27| I understand that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| Mr. Roach, please address counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| Even working for the employer he worked for, okay, people said, well, it was UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3694)|
| 1:01:41| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| Some crazy folk over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| He was in danger a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| He had a lot of responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| And the bad part about that was, again, he had that gun on his hip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| He has to react differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| He has to act differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| A lot more responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| That comes with the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| That comes with the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| If you don't understand that, don't do this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| Don't do this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| Please don't do this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| If you don't like the people that you look at and supposedly are to serve, don't do the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3733)|
| 1:02:19| You're asking for trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| And as far as the recognition of what law enforcement has to go through, okay, in performing their jobs, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3743)|
| 1:02:34| I can't believe that someone can be on a force for a long length of time and not be dealt with that says and does things that are denigrating to a whole gender or to a whole group of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3754)|
| 1:02:49| I can't believe that, that people didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| If you can't look your fellow officer in the eye, if you can't look your fellow employee in the eye and go, hey, you're wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3772)|
| 1:03:01| Hey, we're going to have to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| Get another job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3785)|
| 1:03:06| Because people's lives depend on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| I was just going to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| I want to say something before then if you don't mind, just to follow up on a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| So on some of the issues, so we've been talking a lot about body cameras and relationships with the community and the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3801)|
| 1:03:33| But I also want to address the issue about benefits and the hiring situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3813)|
| 1:03:40| One of the things that's been most frustrating for me, if we're talking about our frustrations, is the issue about getting enough recruits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3820)|
| 1:03:50| You know, both hiring new officers, and I know Chief Roush felt the same way, and Chief Thomas does too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3830)|
| 1:03:58| So I've talked to mayors across the country about this, and as Mr. Taylor mentioned and maybe Mr. Lyon too tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3838)|
| 1:04:07| and I know, Mark, you've brought me articles in the past about the problems across the country with hiring new officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3847)|
| 1:04:14| This is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| It's exacerbated by the fact that there's a strong economy out there and there are more options for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3855)|
| 1:04:23| We've seen both police and fire have this problem now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| Even though we've had a full fire recruit class last time, we know fewer people are applying for the job, so we need to be monitoring that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3866)|
| 1:04:35| So we have had an all-court press on to try and get more officers recruited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3875)|
| 1:04:42| And one of the things that the FOP brought to us last year was we need a $40,000 base salary in order to recruit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3882)|
| 1:04:51| Salary surveys based on our civil service didn't really show that that's what was competitive, that it was higher than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3891)|
| 1:05:00| But we went ahead based on that recommendation by our desire to be able to hire more recruits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3900)|
| 1:05:07| We brought that to council and we addressed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3907)|
| 1:05:12| So there's a $40,000 entry salary now for new officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3912)|
| 1:05:18| One of the things Chief Thomas initiated in the last year was lateral hires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3918)|
| 1:05:26| That was something that we didn't allow before, and so that's something that's available so we can bring people in who already have experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3926)|
| 1:05:34| and they still have to go through some training, but I think not the same degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3934)|
| 1:05:40| You mentioned, Councilwoman Singh, about, well, we need more social workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| We were in a meeting just the other day with Captain Jones and Officer Clinton who addressed a lot of the homeless issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3944)|
| 1:05:52| and we know that there's a tremendous demand on our officers in addressing homelessness, drug issues, mental health issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3952)|
| 1:06:03| and just in sitting there and talking about what he needed, we've designed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3963)|
| 1:06:09| we are in the process of changing a current contract with one of our vendors to provide a social worker to ride along with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3969)|
| 1:06:19| So we will be initiating this co-response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| So a lot of these are, you know, is that going to solve the problem? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| Will it help towards addressing and give us some good models to build on? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3985)|
| 1:06:30| So co-response and having more social workers, you know, police officers are like teachers now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3990)|
| 1:06:35| They're expected to solve every problem in society, either in the classroom or out in the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=3995)|
| 1:06:41| So we have to provide additional support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4001)|
| 1:06:45| We've also, in addition to the economy that's already been talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| just the whole nature of community and police relations across the country have made it less desirable for people to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4009)|
| 1:06:56| I don't know about this 90 percent rate, but in my experience, it's more like 99 percent of the time, you know, we're doing it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4016)|
| 1:07:06| And if you look at the number of, Chief and I were talking about this today, the number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4026)|
| 1:07:12| and you might probably have those numbers with you, but the number, if you look at the number of calls for service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4032)|
| 1:07:18| the number of citations, the number of arrests, even just looking at the number of arrests versus the use of force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4038)|
| 1:07:25| it's minuscule, okay, the number of times that our officers have to use force in a situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4045)|
| 1:07:31| What you hear about is where it has to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| But there are hundreds and thousands of times when there is no force that is used, that is not required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4054)|
| 1:07:41| or that they're able to manage the situation such so that use of force is not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4061)|
| 1:07:46| So we tend in conversations like this to focus on the aberrations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4066)|
| 1:07:52| which you have to focus on because they do occur, and when we make mistakes, we have to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4072)|
| 1:07:58| And we need to make sure that if we need to train more, whatever it is we need to do, we have to do more of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4078)|
| 1:08:07| So whatever we've been doing, we have to continue and we need to do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| We understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| But when we focus on an incident, as tragic as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4092)|
| 1:08:16| and then project that out to say that the entire police department has a problem or a culture problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4096)|
| 1:08:24| I just don't buy that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4104)|
| 1:08:25| That's because I've lived this for eight years and seen this department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4105)|
| 1:08:29| We do not have a massive culture problem in the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4109)|
| 1:08:34| What we have are incidents that occur that we don't want to occur and we investigate them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4114)|
| 1:08:41| and if there's fault, then the chips fall on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4121)|
| 1:08:47| But I have not seen a culture problem in this department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| But we don't sit back and say, okay, we don't have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| We continue to train, to address, and whenever anything happens, whether it's here or in another community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4134)|
| 1:09:02| they train on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| You know, if we were in Charlottesville, what would we have done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| If we were in, you know, name a city where there's been a problem, how would we respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4147)|
| 1:09:13| You know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| And so my experience is that our officers do the right thing, they want to do the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4154)|
| 1:09:21| and we are training them to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| But there are aberrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| But don't let that reflect on the entire department or on the work of the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| who have to solve our societal problems every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| Now, so with that, we have worked and tried every, for the last five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4174)|
| 1:09:41| we have gone above the 2.5% and we have made different structure adjustments to the pay scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4181)|
| 1:09:50| in addition to then the 40,000 that we mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| That's based on working with our FOP, working with our chief, working with civil service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4193)|
| 1:09:59| and the salary surveys and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| We have done things like, when you're talking about benefits, how do we retain people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4203)|
| 1:10:08| We added another holiday, which is basically money in the pocket for police and fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| because of the way their schedules work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| We are about to roll out some maternity leave that we have all talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| and we met with our employee reps the other day about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| This will be this coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| We're about to announce this, so hey, I'll announce it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| This will be the sixth year in a row where we have had no health premiums increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4229)|
| 1:10:35| We've been able to hold that for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| Not many other places can say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| Oh, is it enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| No, I'm not saying it's enough, and these are not excuses, you know, like, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| we've already done all this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| All I'm saying is that we have been committed, my administration, this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4249)|
| 1:10:55| you know, before, the five of you that are new, have been committed to working with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4255)|
| 1:11:02| through Save Our Sons, through different discussions, through PARCC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| through the community, through Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| We have been committed to addressing every single neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4270)|
| 1:11:14| and creating equity and fairness and balance throughout our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4274)|
| 1:11:20| Have we achieved that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| No, but we have been committed to it and will continue to work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4282)|
| 1:11:27| So continue to challenge us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| I think we should always be reminded that there are still inequities out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4289)|
| 1:11:34| and that we make mistakes, but don't think we don't care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| and don't think we haven't been addressing it because we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| But the challenge continues, and we are committed to continuing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4301)|
| 1:11:47| And this council that will continue on this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4307)|
| 1:11:52| So we, at this point, we are continuing to, I think the new, with the lateral change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4312)|
| 1:12:01| with the increase in the base salary, with the additional benefits, those are all things that help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| but I think this council and the next administration has to continue to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4326)|
| 1:12:12| what do we need to do over and above that in order to recruit and to retain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4332)|
| 1:12:19| But we have focused on it every single year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| and we look forward to the last 101 days of my administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4343)|
| 1:12:29| I will do whatever I can to continue to work with FOP, with our firefighters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4349)|
| 1:12:34| with our general government employees to address these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| And I know these five council members who will continue on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| and I can assure you the two mayoral candidates that we know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4361)|
| 1:12:46| I'm sure they'll care about this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| Okay, so anything else on this resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=4371)|

| 1:25:41| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5141)|
| 1:25:42| Is this better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5142)|
| 1:25:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5143)|
| 1:25:44| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5144)|
| 1:25:45| So we're going to build a brand-new 90-bed inpatient acute psychiatric hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5145)|
| 1:25:51| and we're going to partner with Covenant Health System to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5151)|
| 1:25:55| So it will increase the capacity for psychiatric inpatient services, which is certainly needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5155)|
| 1:26:05| We went through a certificate of need to get approval to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5165)|
| 1:26:09| It was unopposed, unanimously approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5169)|
| 1:26:12| Even some of the state's major payers endorsed the fact that there is a need for those inpatient beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5172)|
| 1:26:20| So we'll also have outpatient services, intensive outpatient programming that's there at the campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5180)|
| 1:26:28| Some of that will be mental health-focused, and some will be addiction tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5188)|
| 1:26:36| We'd like to add medication-assisted treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5196)|
| 1:26:43| That's a separate approval process that we need to go through that will take some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5203)|
| 1:26:48| But this initial rezoning and construction will be the inpatient psychiatric beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5208)|
| 1:26:54| and the outpatient services I mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| Will there be two separate sections, one for certain mental health issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5216)|
| 1:27:00| and another one for addiction issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| Well, not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| We will have a unit that's a co-occurring unit that is for patients that present with both those needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5225)|
| 1:27:12| But the inpatient beds will be primarily psychiatric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5232)|
| 1:27:19| We will have a detox unit, but it won't be a residential treatment center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5239)|
| 1:27:24| It won't be a 30-day sort of program for addiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5244)|
| 1:27:29| I just would sort of draw that distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| We do have one of those in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| This will be more on the acute level of care, which is typically a week rather than months at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5254)|
| 1:27:43| But our outpatient programming, that will go for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5263)|
| 1:27:47| And then referrals will come from Covenant Health?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| Yes, and all throughout the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| We'll work closely with law enforcement, all the med-surg hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5273)|
| 1:28:00| When you look at our other hospitals, they're not concentrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| They come throughout the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| And then you do have other locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| How have things been running there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| I guess I'm asking that just to like what the community thinks about your other locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5291)|
| 1:28:17| if there have been any issues at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| I think it's been well-received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| Acadia is based in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5303)|
| 1:28:24| This has been the area of greatest investment for our company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5304)|
| 1:28:28| We're a multinational company, the largest provider of behavioral health services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5308)|
| 1:28:35| But we are very active in Tennessee and have built a new hospital that's similar in Chattanooga that we opened in the middle of 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5315)|
| 1:28:45| That's probably the best comparison, given it's not too far down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5325)|
| 1:28:49| And we also partnered with a health system there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| That was Erlanger Health System in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| And it's doing really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| It's an 88-bed hospital, and we're serving 70 patients, just a little bit over a year in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5337)|
| 1:29:05| And we haven't had major instances that passed all our surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5345)|
| 1:29:09| And I think it's definitely tracked, if not exceeded our expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5349)|
| 1:29:15| I don't anticipate anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| I'm just kind of covering, and I haven't heard any complaints from the community at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5357)|
| 1:29:22| I think it's a very needed service, so welcome to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5362)|
| 1:29:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5365)|
| 1:29:26| After we approve the next thing, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5366)|

| 1:29:37| Will the facility be able to accept commitments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5380)|

| 1:32:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5568)|
| 1:33:16| I just wanted to give him a moment in this space and say his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5596)|
| 1:33:44| His family, they are in Rhode Island right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5624)|
| 1:33:49| They have laid him to rest, so they cannot be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5629)|
| 1:33:57| I have brought bread with this family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| I've stayed with this family, and I love this family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5639)|
| 1:34:06| They have entrusted members of the community to voice their demands, and I know it's not up to you about what will follow behind me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5646)|
| 1:34:19| but that doesn't mean that we can't speak on it and we shouldn't speak on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5659)|
| 1:34:24| So instead of listening to rebut, just listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5664)|
| 1:34:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5672)|
| 1:34:33| Next is Cherise Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5673)|
| 1:34:40| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5680)|
| 1:34:41| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5681)|
| 1:34:45| Cherise Starr, 1329 Brown Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5685)|
| 1:34:50| Just moved there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5690)|
| 1:35:00| The family of Philly Feet is facing a nightmare that I know all y'all know it's a nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5700)|
| 1:35:11| We all know it's a nightmare, and they have been strong enough in their grief to list out demands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5711)|
| 1:35:22| things that they feel like they still deserve, that their son, their brother, the father of three, feel like he deserves in his honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5722)|
| 1:35:38| Earlier in the conversation hearing y'all talking about body cams and talking about also the need of building relationships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5738)|
| 1:35:46| it can't be we're trying to build a relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| Look, it's how we act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| It's how we act in tragedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| We don't make it just this one incident when we know there's been many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5754)|
| 1:36:00| And even this one incident is a tragedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| Even this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5763)|
| 1:36:04| It shouldn't have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| It shouldn't have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| And even in this blame game, the facts are that a police officer killed this man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5768)|
| 1:36:16| He killed him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5776)|
| 1:36:19| That happened, and this family has to live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| Those children got to live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| I have to live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| Y'all have to live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| So with building a relationship, how are y'all building a relationship with this family now that this has happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5790)|
| 1:36:38| One of their demands is a nationwide apology to the friends and family from Police Chief Eve Thomas and Mayor Rojero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5798)|
| 1:36:53| We watched the narrative be taken away from this family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5813)|
| 1:36:57| The narrative shown on WATE, showed on Knox News, showing his mugshot, talking about a troubled past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5817)|
| 1:37:04| That's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| That's not how you honor people who passed away, because we know he was more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5825)|
| 1:37:09| Y'all know he was more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5829)|
| 1:37:12| The facts have been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5832)|
| 1:37:13| He is more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5833)|
| 1:37:14| They want an apology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| That's how y'all can build a relationship with this family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| It's communicating that y'all knew him, y'all saw him as a human.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5839)|
| 1:37:24| Y'all recognized him as a human.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5844)|
| 1:37:27| That's how y'all can build a relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5847)|
| 1:37:30| You can leverage your power, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| You can leverage your power, Eve Thomas, and just give an immediate recognition of the loss of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5852)|
| 1:37:39| Y'all can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| That doesn't take a DA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| Recognize the loss of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5863)|
| 1:37:44| Recognize that one of your police people was involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5864)|
| 1:37:48| Recognize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5868)|
| 1:37:49| And they want that immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5869)|
| 1:37:51| Immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5871)|
| 1:37:52| Because they've been waiting on it, and it should have came when he was killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5872)|
| 1:37:59| They also want a correction of the disparaging info and remarks from the victim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5879)|
| 1:38:06| About the victim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| Don't push that narrative that's already been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| The narrative that's already been pushed, that y'all are worried about this policeman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5891)|
| 1:38:15| The police officers are carrying him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| There hasn't been that about this family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| They want a correction on the disparaging info and remarks about Philly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5901)|
| 1:38:27| They also want a wrongdoing after conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5907)|
| 1:38:30| A mission of wrongdoing after the conclusion of the DA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| So, even in this apology that they're asking for, it's not cheap apology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5914)|
| 1:38:39| Apology is not just, I'm sorry, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| Like, apologies are immense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| They're actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| They're restorative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5926)|
| 1:38:47| And they onset healing for the family, for this community that y'all are leaders of, for that block that watched it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5927)|
| 1:38:57| There needs to be healing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5937)|
| 1:38:58| Y'all can onset that by making amends, making an apology, doing actions to be restorative for what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5938)|
| 1:39:07| It's a tragedy what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| It's a tragedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5951)|
| 1:39:12| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5952)|
| 1:39:17| Next is Mr. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5957)|
| 1:39:29| I'm also here to speak on behalf of Shannara Phipps' family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5969)|
| 1:39:41| actions that they would like to see happen, which would give substance to the concept of justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5981)|
| 1:39:53| Appropriate charges filed that result in incarceration of the one who pulled the trigger and took his life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=5993)|
| 1:40:04| Normal legal processes that would apply to normal civilians be brought to bear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6004)|
| 1:40:12| That is, the whole charging process, arrests and incarceration, representative of previous legal actions that have taken place in Knoxville and Knox County courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6012)|
| 1:40:30| Once charged, immediate dismissal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6030)|
| 1:40:36| Alleviation of all rights and privileges that includes leave, vacation, insurances, immediate disconnect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6036)|
| 1:40:46| Again, this is the request of the family that would give them the impression that justice is somewhere in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6046)|
| 1:40:56| Convocation of pension and a distribution of that pension to the family as part of a reparation to the family, a healing gesture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6056)|
| 1:41:11| Because really, there is no price for that loss of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6071)|
| 1:41:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| Mr. Nordstrom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6083)|
| 1:41:29| Again, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6089)|
| 1:41:30| Please state your name and address again for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| Noah Nordstrom, 1605 Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6094)|
| 1:41:39| It's time we face the ugly truth that the police do not exist to protect and serve all communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6099)|
| 1:41:46| They never have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6106)|
| 1:41:48| Policing began as slave patrol, as I've said here before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6108)|
| 1:41:51| And towards the end of the 1800s, they began serving as private armies for factory owners, slaughtering workers trying to organize unions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6111)|
| 1:41:59| Throughout the Jim Crow South, police covered up and, in many cases, participated in lynchings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6119)|
| 1:42:05| Sadly, police have hardly changed since these dark days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6125)|
| 1:42:10| Today in Knoxville, police target undocumented community members using 287G in the county's jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6130)|
| 1:42:16| That separates families and destroys lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6136)|
| 1:42:19| Today in Knoxville, police are disproportionately patrolling black and brown working class communities, treating everyone like suspects for simply existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6139)|
| 1:42:29| Police are trained to fear and harass people of color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6149)|
| 1:42:34| And as we saw on August 26th, this leads to taxpayer-funded death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6154)|
| 1:42:40| Rather than demanding justice for a slain member of our community, our elected leaders have told us to be calm and to trust the sheriff's in-house investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6160)|
| 1:42:52| But how can we be calm when a child is fatherless because of the racism in this city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6172)|
| 1:42:58| How can we be calm when an unarmed man was shot twice in the back and our elected officials are sending condolences to his killers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6178)|
| 1:43:06| This stops today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| Today, you all voted to put body cameras on every police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6189)|
| 1:43:14| We need to make sure that if they don't use them, that if they refuse to release the footage or if they try to tamper with them in any way, that there are penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6194)|
| 1:43:22| We also demand the dash cam footage for the scene of Philly's murder be released immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6202)|
| 1:43:28| And this body should be pressuring the DA if the DA is the person with the sole responsibility to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6208)|
| 1:43:34| Our community deserves answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6214)|
| 1:43:37| The Feeb family deserves justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| But it's not going to happen unless we come together as a united front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6220)|
| 1:43:46| And it's time for everybody, and particularly comfortable white people, to get off the sidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6226)|
| 1:43:51| It's time to use your privilege to fight for black and brown members of your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6231)|
| 1:43:56| It's time for the city to withhold our tax dollars from a police department that's committed to harming the most vulnerable members of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6236)|
| 1:44:05| I need you all to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| I need you all to show up for your neighbors in your neighborhoods and here at City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6247)|
| 1:44:12| Because none of us are going to be free until all of us are free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6252)|
| 1:44:16| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6258)|
| 1:44:22| Okay, Council, so that is the end of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| And if there's no further business, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190910?start=6266)|
