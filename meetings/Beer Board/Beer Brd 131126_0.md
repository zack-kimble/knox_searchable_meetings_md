| 0:10:49| We did have a couple of applications that were in process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| They wrapped up, picked up their applications, and so we can skip that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| Can we next go to the administrative hearing for Exotica?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=655)|

| 0:11:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| Would you like to introduce yourself, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| I've been here before on behalf of this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| My name is Greg Harris, and I'm an attorney in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| My address is 800 South Gay Street, Suite 1650, Knoxville, 37929.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=677)|
| 0:11:24| And on this occasion, I do have the owner with me also, if you want him to introduce himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| Yeah, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| My name is Carlos Ponce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| I'm the owner of Exotica.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| 315 Mohican Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| This club has had a sale to a minor on two different occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| One was April the 20th, 2012, again on March the 16th in 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=703)|
| 0:11:49| They've gone to TABC, and there are a series of suspensions of their liquor license from TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=709)|
| 0:11:57| And for those of you who are concerned because they're not like ten consecutive days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| they're not open every day of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| So TABC is looking at the days a business is open when they do their suspensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=723)|
| 0:12:10| so that people have their license suspended on days that it's costing them money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| because they can't do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| You also are scheduled for an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| I mean, I'm sorry, you're scheduled for the hearing officer on December 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=742)|
| 0:12:28| This particular meeting is about the TABC notice that we received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| So what we would like to do is fold that into the December 3rd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| so that everything can be managed at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| Are you all agreeable to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| I've spoken with Alice and Easterday with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| And we would anticipate having an order of compromise hopefully Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=768)|
| 0:12:55| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| Is the beer board comfortable with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| And once this goes to the hearing officer, we will get a report back as to the final outcome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=781)|
| 0:13:07| and we'll get that to you as soon as it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| Okay, so I need a motion to send this on to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| This is the TABC hearing part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| Mr. Ponce, your company has been before this beer board two times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| We don't want to see you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| I mean, I'm not saying that to be ugly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| You're a nice person, and that's fine, but we do not want you back here a third time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| This beer board does not take these violations any more lightly than you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| and I did notice that your remedial plan shows that you've really raised the ante on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=822)|
| 0:13:48| So we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| You'll have the hearing officer on December 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| Okay, do we have anybody sign up for public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| Does anybody have anything else to talk about with the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| Do we need to take any action relative to our workshop last week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| But thank you for asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| Especially, Ben's application is now online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| and I think the first one will come in from the Knoxville Opera| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| because they've been asking for the application for 2014 for the Rossini Festival for several weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=862)|
| 0:14:29| And so Ms. Day and Ms. Dyer asked them to be more patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| They would like the outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| So they now have that in their hand, and I think it's on the website today or tomorrow, maybe overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=875)|
| 0:14:42| And so that has taken care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| I thought the workshop went very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| I appreciated everyone's participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| I hope we answered some questions and we can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| There being no further business, this beer board meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131126?start=894)|
