|      29 |    39 | Good afternoon. Today is July 17th and I'm calling to order the Knox County Beer Board. Roll call please.                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=29.0)   |
|      39 |    57 | Commissioner Lundy. Here. Commissioner Durant. Here. Commissioner Oster. Here. Commissioner Ward. Here. Commissioner Schoolmaker. Here. Commissioner Hill. Here. Commissioner Lee. Here. Commissioner Beeler. Here. Commissioner Daly. Here. Commissioner Jay. | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=39.0)   |
|      57 |    70 | Commissioner Frazier. Present. Team members present. Thank you. We could all please stand for the Pledge of Allegiance and that will be done by David Buch, our law director.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=57.0)   |
|      70 |    90 | I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=70.0)   |
|     100 |   129 | All right, looking at item three, could I have a motion please for approval of the minutes? Motion by Ward, second by Oster. Any discussion? All in favor? Aye. Opposed? Motion carries.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=100.0)  |
|     129 |   154 | I would like to add a caveat at this point if there's no objection. Commissioner Daly has asked we have number seven, a discussion item, added about the state inspection on beer permits. So seeing no objection, that will be added to our agenda.           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=129.0)  |

|    1114 |  1124 | Has the employee that sold the alcohol to the underage person, has that employee taken a server training program?                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1114.0) |

|    1150 |  1157 | I mean, I would assume that employee needs to complete that training course before they sell alcohol.                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1150.0) |

|    1190 |  1199 | Again, you know, it's obviously not a laughing matter, and I would just encourage you, please take every measure you can to make sure this doesn't happen again.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1190.0) |

|    1294 |  1303 | The holdup was he could not sell his business because the state of Tennessee would not go out and inspect until the transaction was completed,                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1294.0) |

|    1315 |  1324 | It's my understanding that we can't issue a beer permit even if the state does not send in that letter of inspection.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1315.0) |
|    1324 |  1327 | We can issue that according to our ordinance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1324.0) |
|    1327 |  1332 | So we might need to take this discussion up next month.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1327.0) |
|    1332 |  1338 | We can't hold, even though I don't drink beer and I wish it was never invented as far as I'm concerned,                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1332.0) |
|    1338 |  1349 | but we cannot hold up a business from being sold or opened because the state of Tennessee don't want to go and do a health inspection.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1338.0) |
|    1349 |  1356 | I agree with that, and I don't know why it got turned away from the health department to the state.                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1349.0) |
|    1356 |  1364 | Because as soon as you get the bureaucracy of the state, you're exactly right, and it's not fair in my opinion.                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1356.0) |
|    1364 |  1372 | And I don't know why we can't get it back with the health department because they can act as they used to do,                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1364.0) |
|    1372 |  1376 | sit down there and say yea or nay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1372.0) |
|    1376 |  1384 | And I don't know the answer and how to get around that, and I don't know why it got transferred to the state.                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1376.0) |
|    1384 |  1392 | Anything to do with the state is just bureaucratic mess.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1384.0) |
|    1393 |  1398 | Commissioner Schoonmaker says we're the only county in the state that did that.                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1393.0) |
|    1398 |  1399 | Mr. Schoonmaker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1398.0) |
|    1399 |  1400 | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1399.0) |
|    1400 |  1407 | In other words, the state of Tennessee allowed the Knox County Health Department to do their inspections for them under a contract,                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1400.0) |
|    1407 |  1415 | but we were the only county in Tennessee that did it, and that's why they took it back over under their wings.                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1407.0) |
|    1415 |  1420 | Am I correct, Kathy?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1415.0) |

|    1422 |  1424 | That's what I understood from talking to you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1422.0) |

|    1436 |  1439 | Mr. Daly, do you have a suggestion or a recommendation?                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1436.0) |
|    1439 |  1443 | Well, Mr. Moyer said that we could go ahead if that comes up again.                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1439.0) |
|    1443 |  1448 | He thinks that we, according to our ordinance, we can't approve the beer permit,                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1443.0) |
|    1448 |  1452 | and it's up to the state to go out and do the inspection.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1448.0) |
|    1452 |  1456 | If we approve the beer permit, the sale can go through.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1452.0) |
|    1456 |  1461 | Then if the state goes out, which sounds like we need to try to get it back,                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1456.0) |
|    1461 |  1467 | if the sale goes through and inspection fails, it's on the new owner.                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1461.0) |
|    1467 |  1469 | The new owner has got the property.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1467.0) |
|    1469 |  1474 | It's up to him to repair or whatever they've got to do at that point in time.                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1469.0) |
|    1474 |  1480 | They're not going to close on the sale without that permit.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1474.0) |
|    1480 |  1483 | They're not going to close on the sale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1480.0) |
|    1483 |  1485 | And I can understand why.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1483.0) |
|    1485 |  1490 | I wouldn't want to buy a piece of property that is now selling beer                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1485.0) |
|    1490 |  1493 | just because I have to purchase it                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1490.0) |
|    1493 |  1497 | and then turn around and wait for an inspection that may or may not pass.                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1493.0) |
|    1497 |  1499 | I need to know that up front.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1497.0) |
|    1499 |  1501 | And that's only fair.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1499.0) |
|    1501 |  1502 | All right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1501.0) |
|    1502 |  1503 | Mr. Schoonmaker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1502.0) |
|    1504 |  1505 | Thank you, Madam Chair.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1504.0) |
|    1505 |  1511 | So, in other words, it was a contingency sale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1505.0) |
|    1511 |  1515 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1511.0) |
|    1515 |  1519 | But if we issue a beer permit to somebody,                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1515.0) |
|    1519 |  1523 | is it the state doesn't want to come out till they actually own that property?                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1519.0) |
