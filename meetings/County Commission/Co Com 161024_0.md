| 0:01:45| Papers to Pixels, there is something for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=105)|
| 0:01:50| Corita Black and her staff do an outstanding job in all aspects of programming in our service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=110)|

| 0:02:43| Are there any comments or discussion of this particular presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=163)|
| 0:02:49| I would like to express our appreciation for there's nothing sweeter than sugar and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| plenty of pieces of that over on the table on the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| I'd also like to comment about the library system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| From my personal experience, whether it be Corrington or Mascot or Carter, those libraries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=182)|
| 0:03:10| in the east end of the county do an excellent job, not just during the school year, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=190)|
| 0:03:15| I want to commend the programs that occur during the summer to help kids that are out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=195)|
| 0:03:23| during the summer to continue to stay in the mode of doing something that's related to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=203)|
| 0:03:29| schoolwork and all three of those libraries really have good summer programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=209)|
| 0:03:38| If there be no other comments about the libraries, I'd ask you to move to page 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=218)|
| 0:03:47| On page 22 in other business, presentation of the Tennessee County Services Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=227)|
| 0:03:53| Award, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| Commissioners Bussler, Carringer, Daly, Gill, and myself accepted an award on behalf of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=239)|
| 0:04:06| Knox County on Thursday, October 13th in Nashville at the annual meeting of the Tennessee County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=246)|
| 0:04:12| Services Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=252)|
| 0:04:15| The Tennessee County Services Association represents the 95 county mayors, the 95 county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=255)|
| 0:04:24| road supervisors, and the 1,640 Knox County commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| So at this time, I would like to present this award to Mayor Tim Burchett on behalf of receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=269)|
| 0:04:36| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| I'm sitting here just talking in my rose, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| I appreciate everybody getting those roses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| I dipped into my own personal funds to buy those and those lovely sashes that everybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| wearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| Hey, I do appreciate this very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| Actually, the person who did all the work, it's funny when you're mayor, you get credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=296)|
| 0:05:00| for things, but the people who actually do the work are usually standing in the background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=300)|
| 0:05:07| But I'd like Karen Smitherman to come down here, Karen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| She actually, her and Hugh did all the work on this, but she actually did the heavy lifting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=310)|
| 0:05:14| on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| I want to thank her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| Can I give her this rose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| Would that be all right with y'all if I hand her this rose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| No deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| I got a nod, but thank you so much, Karen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| Here, you want to turn around here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| We'll get the picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| I have them on the short range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| Y'all know that, you know, we've talked about this, about a lot of things, about reducing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=326)|
| 0:05:41| our energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=341)|
| 0:05:42| Oh, Tim Burchett, 501 Princeton Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| Sorry, I forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| 37919, forgot to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| We talk a lot about energy and where we're going with it, but one of the things I see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| in the future, we are going to have to quit relying on these foreign countries for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=352)|
| 0:05:59| energy resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| This is just something that's renewable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| God makes it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| Solar energy is a wonderful thing, and we've, you know, we've put it on our buildings and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| our schools, and I think it's a great lesson for the kids, too, but it just seems to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=368)|
| 0:06:15| a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| So, we're glad that we were able to do this, and thank you so much for your, would you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| All right, good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=383)|
| 0:06:28| Continuing with public forum, Xavier Presley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| Xavier Presley, 1134 Glade Hill Drive, Knoxville, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=391)|
| 0:06:40| I'm here to say I voted today, and you know I didn't vote for Trump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| I want you to read my sign, because his bus, they wouldn't let me be in front of his bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| to show you today, so I figured I'd bring him to you and show him to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| Use my five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| I'll let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| He is bad for everybody, and it's sad that the senators here, the congressmen, all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=415)|
| 0:07:02| them supporting him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| Lamar Alexander spoke out on WBIR when the election first started, saying he's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| to support whoever his party nominates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| He hasn't taken that away at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| You all make you think it's okay for him to be our leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| It's really sad for our country, and we're in a position now to where we can make a difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| and we don't want to make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| As long as we have these undivided and unqualified people to do this stuff, life is not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=447)|
| 0:07:34| to get better, and as long as this guy was able to manipulate the system and get us in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=454)|
| 0:07:41| this position to where we're at, he'll still be the devil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| He will be the devil, and you all thinking it's okay to vote for the devil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=464)|
| 0:07:50| It's sad for our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| It's sad for our kids, and everybody want to say Hillary Clinton is the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=472)|
| 0:07:58| It's not a politician or lie that haven't lied to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| That's from the local to the state to Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| In order to be a politician, you have to lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| You all have lies up your sleeve that you all haven't even told yet, and you're just waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=490)|
| 0:08:16| for the opportunity to bring them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| The people in Washington, they can care less about us unless we get out here and support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| and speak up in the local election and the state election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| Nothing going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| If they learn how to lie at the local level, they go to the state level and get better liars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=509)|
| 0:08:34| You get up there and say Hillary is a liar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| Hell, she's been there 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| She knows how to lie and believe it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| It's not going to stop with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| You can use all the lies, but she's probably the most qualified person in this whole country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| in any election we ever had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| We just need to stand up and just do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| The right thing is we got to get rid of people like him because you all supported him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| The sign said, Trump, you're fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| He fired himself just for going to the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| The only thing I agree with Trump is when he said the election is rigged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| they've been rigging the election since Abraham Lincoln was around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| and they're not going to stop now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| It's all in who they want to put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| They already know who's going to win the Super Bowl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| They already know who's going to win the World Series.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| This stuff has been set up like this forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| It's like Tennessee is a red state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| Our vote really don't even matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| Whatever the electoral college give them anyway because they're a red state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| So the state and all that stuff, that's the only thing I say he's real about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| He was willing to speak out that the election is rigged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| I was living in Florida, and while I lived in Florida, when George Bush ran for president,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| they was hiding the ballot boxes after we voted up under the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=589)|
| 0:09:55| WSVN News took a picture of it, filmed it, and showed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=595)|
| 0:10:00| where they're pulling ballot boxes from up under the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| That's how easy it was to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| This ain't nothing new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| This has been going on forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| The best thing I come here for is to let you know I'm back again with my Muhammad Ali story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| Until you people decide to believe in some of this stuff, racism is alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| If you all let the news center put this in the newspaper, that shows Knoxville is racist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=620)|
| 0:10:26| There's no way Muhammad Ali should be treated like they did him on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| I'll be back next month with my Muhammad Ali paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=631)|
| 0:10:37| Continuing with public forum, Jamie Gregg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=637)|
| 0:10:48| Good evening, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| Jamie Gregg, 3707 Forest Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| I'm not here on behalf of any specific organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| although I will state that there are multiple organizations currently fighting for this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=657)|
| 0:11:05| I'm here to speak on rural broadband expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| and to encourage the commission to add rural broadband expansion resolution in the November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=669)|
| 0:11:19| I'll note that currently 16 counties in East Tennessee have passed a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=679)|
| 0:11:25| to support the removal of state restrictions on broadband expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=685)|
| 0:11:31| As you're probably aware, currently Tennessee restricts municipal broadband suppliers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=691)|
| 0:11:38| from expanding broadband to counties outside their geographic area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=698)|
| 0:11:46| This is against competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=706)|
| 0:11:51| It doesn't foster fast expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| It doesn't foster reduction of prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| And it certainly doesn't foster what we all want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| which is the expansion of broadband to communities who really need them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| for education, work, and other economic purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=725)|
| 0:12:11| If KUB, for example, decided to provide broadband services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=731)|
| 0:12:17| currently it is prevented from supplying Corryton, Halls, Mascot, Carnes, Farragut, Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=737)|
| 0:12:30| If the Knox County Commission was to support a resolution removing state restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| and put pressure on the state to remove those restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| KUB would immediately be able to provide access to Carnes, Farragut, and Hardin Valleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=760)|
| 0:12:47| And if KUB decided to start providing broadband rural areas of union,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=767)|
| 0:12:54| Granger counties would be able to also immediately benefit due to being within an expanded footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=774)|
| 0:13:01| I also want to note there is a benefit of Knox County to allow this to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=781)|
| 0:13:07| because currently broadband suppliers are taking that money out of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=787)|
| 0:13:13| No money generated from broadband stays within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| If that was to be expanded, we would be keeping more of that money within the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=798)|
| 0:13:26| and not sending it to places like Atlanta and Texas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| where it currently is being sent through AT&T and Comcast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| Again, a couple of commissioners already have the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| I would encourage you to consider adding that resolution to your November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| And last in our public forum will be J.T. Taylor and Joshua Thornhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=830)|
| 0:14:02| Could I have your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| J.T. Taylor, 241 Hawthorne Ave, 37920 Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=844)|
| 0:14:15| Joshua Thornhill, 6913 Asheville Highway, 37924.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=855)|
| 0:14:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| On behalf of the East Tennessee Peace and Justice Center and the Knox County Unchained Collective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| I will pose some questions to you all regarding the contract between Knox County Jails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| Knox County, and Secures Technologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| As a result, family members near or far from their loved ones who are incarcerated in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=879)|
| 0:14:46| or Knox County Jails cannot see them face-to-face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| Personal visitation is no longer permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| This happened not too long, but very shortly after the contract was solidified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| between Knox County Jails and Secures Technologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| Secures Technologies provides the video kiosk for families to be able to see their loved one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| It also extends out through the tablet service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| Family members can go there and use the kiosk, but there is no personal contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| The face-to-face visits are no longer allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| And I just believe that that's very harsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| I don't see any reason why that is being efficient for anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| It doesn't help anyone or give anyone any hope while they're on the inside to have anyone to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| if they're left out of contact with their family members for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| I know that, you know, it was deliberated on last year around this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| and it was a very short deliberation, about two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| And people seem pretty sure about it, but there seems to be a lot of complaints coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| People all over the country, in Texas, North Carolina, all over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| are pushing back against Secures Technologies and others like it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| because you're profiting a whole lot off of families not being able to see each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=954)|
| 0:15:59| And the fact that right after the contract is made, personal visitation is sliced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| you know, that's really concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| We would like to know if there's going to be a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| Has anyone been surveying the families of folks who have been locked up in KCJ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| to see what the effect of Secures has been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| All I've heard are negative things about it being spotty service, not very well efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=975)|
| 0:16:21| People are feeling unsafe about it because they want to see their family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| There's an issue of transparency when you can't see your loved one when they're in jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| because, you know, they're only able to see you through glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| They don't see you through the World Wide Web.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| I just really wish that we could have that personal visitation back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| So I want to know if you all will consider any of these factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| when you're looking at the report card that's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| I know that Secures wants to know that, you know, after a year of their services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| will you all buy into another 15 years of this service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| I ask that you all say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| It's been very harsh on the community not to be able to see their loved one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| even if they live around the corner, and even for the families who are far away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| What about the families who are able or who are willing to make it possible for themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| to come down here to see their loved ones if they're locked up in KCJ?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| We're depriving them of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| You know, what really kind of service is that that we're giving people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| And we only sold our technology that we had for $200,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| and then we make this contract with Secures where now we're making 20% off the top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| from these services, and it's not trickling down to the families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| It's not producing anything more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| In fact, the kiosks have made health care even worse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| because people are going to the kiosks choosing between do I email my family member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| or do I, you know, request somebody to come and check on these chest pains for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| It's caused violence in the pods because there are more pods in kiosks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| than there are of actual people who are out there serving, you know, the COs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| So it's just caused so much ineffect and harm than good in just one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| And the complaints have all been about the service, it being inefficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| how they can barely get a hold to Secures to be able to talk it out as being the third party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| whenever they do have issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| Most of their complaints are not even answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| So I really want to know if you all will release something to the public regarding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| There hasn't been a lot of talk about it besides things that community members have done themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| You know, it's really a crying shame that we haven't heard anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| and this contract report is coming up so soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| If not sooner, we haven't heard much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| But people want to know if we're going to buy into another 15 years of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1107)|
| 0:18:32| You know, it's a real concern when we have Sheriff J.J. getting lawsuits about this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| with the letters regarding the Secures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| You know, it's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| I can't get him to talk to the public about the issue as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| because there's already been so much with just one piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| So I ask all of you all, will you consider these factors when you look at the contract that's coming up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| Will Sheriff J.J. consider this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| Will families and community members be involved in this and tell you about how they feel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| They would love to be palm to palm with their family members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| be able to hold their hand and say, how are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| Rather than looking at you through a tablet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| I can't really tell and facilitate if my family member is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| I can't even see them head to toe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1152)|
| 0:19:19| Will we, at the very least, to start this conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| which has to be a very quick pace when I really ask of you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| but we can at least start with the personal visitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| Let them come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| Families need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1175)|
| 0:19:42| Yes, hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| Going off of what J.T. had was speak upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| I was arrested in 2012 based off a felicitous charge without prior evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1187)|
| 0:19:55| I was a pre-trial inmate at the time, and being a 21-year-old child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1195)|
| 0:20:01| being a child at the time, I had no understanding prior of what was in store for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| when I had entered the jail system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| The time I was incarcerated, in-person visitation was still important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| My brother was able to visit me, and prior to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| I felt I had lost all contact with the outside world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| As a person, I felt alone, and I felt there was no hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| That moment my brother stepped in there, I honestly broke down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| I'm not a man who breaks down and cries in front of a group often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| Just that single five minutes of having my brother face-to-face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| we both cried talking to one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| and that experience alone inspired me to want to get out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| because I honestly needed my brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| When a person is only able to see them through a video screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| that experience is completely diminished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| It's difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| There are multiple reports where the VO fee is lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| In essence, it feels like the community is getting punished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| for a crime that could be convicted or non-convicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1265)|
| 0:21:12| The question I'm basically asking is, if the care is implored,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| is it not only punishing the inmate, but also the family as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| considering that finances do play a role in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| in addition with the hospital internet connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| Not many people can afford a $60, $70, or $100 internet bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| on a monthly basis to even use this service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| Also, without seeing your family face-to-face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1294)|
| 0:21:40| the biggest thing about that is the inmate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| are they going to want to, will they feel inspired to want to get out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| Will they feel what I felt? Will they feel trapped?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| And in doing so, may they act out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| May they do something that can be perceived as ill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| within the incarceration system and therefore extend their sentencing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| Because internally, they're screaming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| They want to see their family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| I think it's basically a human thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| Everybody wants to see their family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| Moving to honorary resolutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| I bring before you consideration of an honorary resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| moralizing Leanne's samples, honoring Don's samples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| for their efforts to raise awareness of the importance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| of annual flu vaccination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| and increase flu vaccination rates in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1350)|
| 0:22:38| Do I hear a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| Motion is properly before us. All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| Opposed, no. The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| Commissioner Carringer, do you wish the resolution be read into the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1369)|
| 0:22:57| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1377)|
| 0:23:06| Whereas Leanne's samples passed away in April 2014 at the age of 46| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| from complications of the flu virus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| and whereas Leanne and Don's samples were married on New Year's Eve 1991| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| after first meeting on a blind date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| and whereas after moving to Knoxville in 1994 to care for her aging grandparents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| Leanne and Don became foster parents to countless children of all ages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| and subsequently adopted two daughters, Katie and Bella,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| and whereas Leanne is normally remembered for her loving heart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| infectious laugh, and magnificent smile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| whereas after Leanne's death, Don's samples launched a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| We Can For Leanne campaign on social media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| urging people to get the flu shot in memory of his wife and to protect themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| and whereas the We Can For Leanne campaign is now in its third year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| and continues to raise awareness about the dangers of the flu virus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| the importance of being vaccinated each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| and promote the annual free flu shot Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| whereas the Commission of Knox County, on behalf of all the people of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| desires to celebrate the life of Leanne's samples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| and honor Don's samples for his efforts in raising awareness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| of the importance of annual flu vaccinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| The Knox County Commission hereby memorializes Leanne's samples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| and extends their deepest sympathies to her family upon the occasion of her passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| Be it further resolved, the Knox County Commission hereby honors Don's samples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| for his meaningful efforts to raise awareness of the importance of annual flu vaccinations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| and increase flu vaccination rates in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| Be it further resolved that this resolution be presented to the family of Leanne's samples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1494)|
| 0:25:01| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| I was not fortunate to know Don's wife, Leanne,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| but I'm very honored to be able to have the opportunity to carry on this very important thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1509)|
| 0:25:19| that affects that a lot of younger people don't realize how important it is to get the flu| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1519)|
| 0:25:25| and how younger people are more vulnerable to not surviving if you are unfortunate to get the flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1525)|
| 0:25:34| So let me urge everyone and Don, please accept my condolences to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| And we just admire you for being here and for carrying on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1540)|
| 0:25:48| And be glad if you want to say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| My name obviously is Don Samples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| I want to thank all of you for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| I never started this campaign for any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| My whole purpose for the campaign was a way to honor my wife and the mother of my two girls back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1564)|
| 0:26:14| It's a way for them to know that their mom cared for them a great deal and loved them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1574)|
| 0:26:21| And if the whole purpose of the campaign is if I can get one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| who normally would never get a flu shot to get that shot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| that it could save not only their life but the life of their family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| I tell people that you don't want to walk in my shoes for the last two and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1595)|
| 0:26:42| I went through a period of very dark times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| I went through a very tough and emotional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| I now have a beautiful wife that I just married two weeks ago today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1609)|
| 0:26:55| And we're very happy and she's been a great support for this whole campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| She has helped promote it and she has helped work with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| And I know that this Saturday at Gibbs High School is a free flu shot Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| And it's also my wife's birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| So it would be a great, great thing if we absolutely just filled the entire high school gymnasium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| with people getting a shot just for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| So I want to thank the commission for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| This is a great honor and I really greatly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1645)|
| 0:27:39| And in honor of Leanne, all of us county commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| braved the shot of Ms. Wanda from our Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| And I'm telling you, if you have not had your flu shot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| you go to the health department and you ask for Ms. Wanda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| You will not feel a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| I promise you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| Now, Dr. Buchanan, if she wants to say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| Dr. Buchanan, please step forward there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| It is 528.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| I believe that there are people giving flu shots as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| If you are a county employee and have not received a flu shot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| you can step into the small room right now and receive a flu shot if you're a county employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| Martha Buchanan, 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| Actually, we'll expand that to we don't have a ton of doses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| but if you haven't had your flu shot yet and you're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| step next door into the small assembly room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| and we'll be happy to give you a vaccine whether you're a flu shot or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| whether you're a Knox County employee or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| If you want to avail yourself of those services, step next door and we'll do that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1726)|
| 0:28:53| Thank you, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| Turning the page now, page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| Devotional today will be led by Commissioner Evelyn Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1742)|

| 0:29:12| Let us bow our heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| Heavenly Father, as we approach your throne,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| let our hearts and minds honor you and your holy word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| Guide our leaders' thoughts, words, and action on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| Direct and encourage the community we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| For all, we live by your grace and mercy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| I ask these and all other blessings in your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| Let the people say amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| And the pledge will be led by Commissioner Ed Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| Please continue to stand and salute our nation's flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1794)|
| 0:30:06| Thank you, Commissioner Gill and Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=1806)|

| 0:34:46| I just have a question about the line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| I think it's amazing and great that our engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| and public works department can transfer six cents from a road project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2095)|
| 0:35:01| on Parkside Drive to a road project on Dutchtown Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| I think that's amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| So I thought that was kind of about the lowest amount I've ever seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| on a line item transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2112)|

| 0:35:17| engineering and public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| I think their efforts are to keep Pew and company satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2118)|

| 0:36:22| Can I do those two items of business before we read the consent agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2182)|
| 0:36:34| My advice has been that I can do this in any order that I want to as long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| as it all gets read into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2197)|
| 0:36:43| And the ladies agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| Well, they're going to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| I hope that they will read no matter what order I put them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2206)|

| 0:37:20| You're going to recuse yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2242)|

| 0:38:41| courageous leaders in the face of very difficult social and political constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2321)|

| 0:39:12| I just want to say thank you also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| And I was back there lined up this time last year with you all, so I'm very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| honored to be sitting up here representing the women of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| Motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| Who is here to represent the group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2367)|
| 0:39:36| I just want to make sure that someone was here to speak on behalf of the women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2376)|

| 0:39:42| Yes, I'm Wanda Sobieski, 5105 Windcroft in Knoxville 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| I'm the coordinator of the Suffrage Coalition, and our coalition brought the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| Women's Suffrage Memorial to Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| And now our next project, using the same artist, is to bring a memorial to Harry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| Byrne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| He was only 24 when he switched his vote at the last minute, broke the tie in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| Tennessee, and enfranchised over 30 million women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| The largest group of people at that time ever enfranchised without a war,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| without a drop of blood being shed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| It was a 72-year struggle, as you can tell, starting in 1848 in Seneca Falls with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2417)|
| 0:40:23| the first public call for women's suffrage, and ending in East Tennessee when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| Harry Byrne's mother's letter persuaded him to change his vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| And so I like to say what our buttons for this project say, and that is East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| Tennessee, where women's suffrage came of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| And so we're really excited to be able to honor these people and make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| history is never lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=2445)|

| 0:55:16| Commissioner Schoonmaker, the discussion of the conference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3316)|
| 0:55:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| The good thing about attending the Tennessee County Services Association annual meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3326)|
| 0:55:34| previously the Knox County delegation only had two commissioners that would attend those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3339)|
| 0:55:40| This time we had five commissioners attend, which was great because being that we're a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| classified as one of the big four counties, it was nice to have that much representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| One of the other great things that happened, the Tennessee County Commissioners Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3351)|
| 0:55:57| one of our commissioners was nominated and elected to the eastern Tennessee region as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3357)|
| 0:56:04| a new board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| So Evelyn Gill is the new eastern Tennessee regional board member for the Tennessee County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3366)|
| 0:56:12| Commissioners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| So that was exciting to get Knox County back on the map, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3374)|
| 0:56:20| We had a great opportunity to go to different classes and actually be exposed to a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3380)|
| 0:56:26| great information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| Each commissioner that attended will take, I guess, a couple of minutes to go over what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| they learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| Just a couple of quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| I attended the maximizing county revenues class, and one of the big issues was the hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3395)|
| 0:56:42| motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3402)|
| 0:56:43| Of course, a lot of the Tennessee counties are struggling to collect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3403)|
| 0:56:49| Apparently, they are not as efficient as we are at the present time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| But one of the big things that was on discussion was the Airbnb, where those folks are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3414)|
| 0:57:00| paying the hotel motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| Of course, the state that's closest to Tennessee that already has a state law in place is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3423)|
| 0:57:09| Alabama that's collecting the tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| And then, of course, they talked about the mineral tax and the situs tax as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3432)|
| 0:57:18| One of the other interesting things was on the legislative committee, where Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| Busler and I serve on that body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| Last year, there was actually 3,751 bills that were introduced to the Tennessee legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3448)|
| 0:57:38| The County Commissioners Association only identified about 80 bills of those that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3458)|
| 0:57:43| actually of value to counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| We came to realize that we underestimated that, and so this year, we're probably going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| to be looking at upwards of 200 to 250 bills that will actually affect counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3472)|
| 0:58:00| One of the things that was probably the most eye-opening to the county commissioners that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3480)|
| 0:58:06| heard this presentation was about the new cellular structures that are going to be coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3486)|
| 0:58:13| online here before 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| Most of you are familiar with 3G and 4G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3496)|
| 0:58:20| Now we're going to have 5G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| The problem with 5G technology is that it has a shorter bandwidth because of its compressed data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3502)|
| 0:58:32| To fully implement 5G for the carriers, you're going to have to have a ten times increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3512)|
| 0:58:41| of the number of cellular structures in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3521)|
| 0:58:47| Most jurisdictions have not actually addressed these issues, particularly with the new distributed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3527)|
| 0:58:55| antenna systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| The other problem with 5G is apparently the coverage goes about 600 yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3537)|
| 0:59:04| Then you have to have another antenna pick it up, shoot it another 600 yards, so that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| why it's such a big, dramatic increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| Of course, the industry in our county has basically been putting them in church steeples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3552)|
| 0:59:18| hiding them behind billboards, being very creative, but now you're going to see them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3558)|
| 0:59:24| along Parkside Drive and Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| The town of Farragut is actually working to figure out exactly how those things are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3567)|
| 0:59:33| to lay out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3573)|
| 0:59:34| It's going to be something that's going to affect everybody, and it's now going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| in the public right-of-way as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| That was probably the most eye-opening thing that most of the smaller counties were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3579)|
| 0:59:45| familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| I'll pass the baton to Mr. Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3588)|
| 0:59:54| Thank you, Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| Before I forget it, I'd like to say that Knox County will be well represented next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3598)|
| 1:00:05| I sit on two boards, or standing committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| That will be membership and veterans and transportation, probably three boards as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3610)|
| 1:00:17| I think every commissioner here is on a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3617)|
| 1:00:22| Knox County will be well, well represented in the coming year at all these functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| coming up, and I'm proud to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| I'll set in on the transportation and infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| Two big things down there, of course, was broadband and transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| I'll break it down into two issues, funding issues and the TCSA's recommendation to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3639)|
| 1:00:45| General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| Of course, the funding issues, we all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| It's the lack of local funding for county highway projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| Mr. Vanderbate was there, and he set in on some meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| A lot of these counties, they're having to cut road projects and cut people back because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3656)|
| 1:01:02| of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| It could be because of less gas tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| It could be because of property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| That is a big issue on the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| Of course, the gasoline and fuel tax remains stagnant, as we all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| I sent in the paper yesterday where I think the governor is going to come out with a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3675)|
| 1:01:20| next year to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| I hear anywhere from $6 billion to $11 billion in transportation projects, probably closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| to $11 billion in backlogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| I believe they said that it would be, this $11 billion would take about 100 years to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3692)|
| 1:01:38| complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| I don't think we're going to be around in 100 years, not us anyway, to complete this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| $11 billion worth of backlogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| Like I said, the county highway departments are scaling back, are canceling paving projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| altogether because they don't have the revenue to do the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3711)|
| 1:01:57| Kind of shocking to me was over 60,000 miles of the roads in Tennessee are county roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3717)|
| 1:02:04| 60,000 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| That's almost three times around the world, just in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| That's a lot of paving and a lot of road work that's got to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3729)|
| 1:02:16| Some of the TCSA's recommendations to the General Assembly were to enact an adequate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| multifaceted funding solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| In other words, just don't raise the gas tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| Let's look at a funding mechanism that will last into the future and take in consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3746)|
| 1:02:32| of the growth, which I think we all would agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| Also, you need to include a measurable growth component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| Just by coming up with a plan and not making adequate preparations for a future increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3759)|
| 1:02:48| is not adequate enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| That needs to be done, and that's something that they'll have us or county associations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3769)|
| 1:02:56| to go to our legislature to push.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| Maintain the current balance of funding for the government in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| We all need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| Make sure we get no cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| Keep current pay as you go to issuing debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| Most people do not realize that the state of Tennessee, we do not borrow money for our roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3789)|
| 1:03:15| We're debt-free on our roads, and that's the great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| We do not need to borrow money for our roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| Oppose general lines on toll funding as a strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| No toll roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| I'm against toll roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| I hate toll roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| I hate to go to Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3807)|
| 1:03:28| Toll road, toll road, toll road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| Appreciated the $142 million restored to the transportation fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| That was Representative Eddie Smith, my representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3815)|
| 1:03:41| He tried to get all $260 million of it, but they kind of agreed to the $142 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3821)|
| 1:03:47| with the rest coming this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| That will help the local counties to pay maybe some more roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3829)|
| 1:03:54| Finally, I don't really know much about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| I don't see anybody from roads here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| Appreciative of the reduced grant match of the state aid and bridge funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| and ask that it be extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| I think it's more of a less red tape type deal so that these counties can borrow money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3847)|
| 1:04:16| at lesser value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3856)|
| 1:04:24| I'll yield to Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| I'm going to just do the highlights of the education report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| and it will be four main components that we understand the critical role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3873)|
| 1:04:39| of quality public education plays in the preservation of health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| and economic viability of our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| The biggest component to that statement happens to be that TCSA supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3887)|
| 1:04:53| and really we must begin to look at the annual inflationary growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3893)|
| 1:04:59| in both the state and local match portions of the BEP formula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| as well as the capital outlay components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| We support and ensure quality teachers in every classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3907)|
| 1:05:11| providing competitive salaries and benefits for Tennessee teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| We also look at making sure that the expansive pursuit of school choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3915)|
| 1:05:22| diverts state and local public school funds out of what is typically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3922)|
| 1:05:28| traditional classrooms and erode educational reform and gains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| And I have to say this in this capacity to say that the local LEA funding stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3933)|
| 1:05:39| long term for technology, infrastructure, interventions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| and remediation will probably need to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| in order to have a balanced budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| But we support the initiatives of education reform as recommended by TCSA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3953)|
| 1:05:58| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| I've actually got two reports here to share with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3962)|
| 1:06:08| One of the TCSA agendas for 2017 is for the jails and correctional facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3968)|
| 1:06:14| The housing and health care costs of maintaining a state prisoner population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| in a local jail facility remain a top priority for TCSA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| as its membership continues to face pressure created by providing this service to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3983)|
| 1:06:29| In fact, one of the fastest growing populations in local jails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| is the backlog of convicted felons awaiting space without state prison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3993)|
| 1:06:39| TCSA reaffirms its longstanding position that $37 per den| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=3999)|
| 1:06:45| for housing state inmates in local jails is grossly inadequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| TCSA wants to work with the administration and General Assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| to develop a funding mechanism that better reflects the actual costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4013)|
| 1:06:58| such as unpaid medical expenses and transportation of inmates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4018)|
| 1:07:02| including those seeking mental health evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| To that end, TCSA urges lawmakers to authorize new cost-saving measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4025)|
| 1:07:11| to help reduce the financial burden, particularly rising inmate medical costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4031)|
| 1:07:16| associated with the housing of all prisoners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| and encourages the administration and General Assembly to take all appropriate steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4039)|
| 1:07:24| to better manage the state inmate population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| in order to alleviate the backlog of convicted felons housed in local jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4047)|
| 1:07:32| And as we all know, this definitely affects Knox County in a big way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4052)|
| 1:07:39| as we work to try to take care of the mental health that we have in our jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4059)|
| 1:07:47| Also, that's been mentioned several times today, was the broadband issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4067)|
| 1:07:55| For the last seven years, supporters of rural broadband have sought approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| from the Tennessee State Legislature to pass legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| that would allow local publicly-owned electric utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| to expand their high-speed Internet services outside of the immediate service areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4088)|
| 1:08:13| But to date, these efforts have failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| Earlier this year, Governor Haslam directed Tennessee Department of Commerce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4096)|
| 1:08:21| and Community Development Commissioner Randy Boyd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| to conduct a study to assess the current state of broadband access in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4104)|
| 1:08:30| and options for increasing access and utilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| The result is a comprehensive report that I encourage everyone to review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4114)|
| 1:08:39| and Jolie sent you all an email this afternoon that has the full report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4119)|
| 1:08:44| It's several pages long, but it's a very informative report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4124)|
| 1:08:48| that I encourage all of you all to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| For purpose of the report, broadband, commonly referred to as high-speed Internet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4131)|
| 1:08:57| was defined as 25 megabits per second download speed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4137)|
| 1:09:02| and 3 megabits per second upload speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4142)|
| 1:09:06| Notably, the study found that while 13% of the population of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4146)|
| 1:09:12| do not have access to the broadband,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| only 2% of Knox County's population fall in this category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| making Knox County the second most connected county in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4160)|
| 1:09:25| surpassed only by Hamilton County at 1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| However, the study also shows that many of our neighboring counties are not so fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4169)|
| 1:09:35| For instance, in these counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| school children often have to travel to a hotspot at a local restaurant to do their homework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4177)|
| 1:09:43| and the lack of high-speed Internet is a significant barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| to the small business expansion into these counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4187)|
| 1:09:51| The fact that many of those living in these surrounding counties work, shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4191)|
| 1:09:56| and do business in Knox County makes this a relevant topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| to be considered by Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| Fifteen East Tennessee County Commissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| including Loudon, Anderson, Jefferson, and Campbell, to name a few,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4206)|
| 1:10:11| have passed resolutions asking the state legislature to pass legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4211)|
| 1:10:16| allowing local determination of broadband and Internet services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4216)|
| 1:10:21| Accordingly, I believe this is a topic that needs to be studied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| by Knox County Commission in the future here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| Also, I just wanted to add how much I enjoyed going to Nashville to this conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4229)|
| 1:10:36| I know it was discussed a while back that Knox County Commission thought about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| hiring a lobbyist to be in Nashville to relate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| And on the way back from Nashville, I just realized the five of us that went,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4245)|
| 1:10:51| we are the lobbyists for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| and every one of us, I think, on commission have very good relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4254)|
| 1:11:00| with our state senators, our house reps in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4260)|
| 1:11:04| And so I think with us all being informed and knowing what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4264)|
| 1:11:08| and keeping everybody accountable in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| we've got our lobbyists right here sitting, all 11 of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4270)|
| 1:11:14| So I just want to let everybody know how much I enjoyed it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| and how it was very educational to be a part of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4279)|
| 1:11:23| and to represent Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| They'd say, where are you from? Knox County is the best, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4285)|
| 1:11:32| Commissioner Anders, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| Well, I was just going to make a statement on Commissioner Carringer's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| You know, we've talked about that lobbyist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| and Commissioner Schoonmaker just made a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| There's going to be 300 bills that come out affecting county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| 3,000 bills that come out affecting county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| There's no way any amount of us 11 part-time legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| can maintain and watch those bills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| and it's been because of the luck of the draw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| There's a couple of bills that got passed that hurt us the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| But I'm telling you, there's 3,000 bills to keep up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| and we can't spend every day down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| and I still think it's a bad idea that Knox County doesn't have a lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4330)|
| 1:12:16| The Tennessee County Commissioners Association represents 95 counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| and only four or five of them are the ones that those large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4340)|
| 1:12:26| when a smaller county gets a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| they can't advocate for both smaller counties and larger counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| There's issues that affect us differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| and so as great as they are as an organization at keeping us informed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4353)|
| 1:12:38| they can't represent both small and large counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| It's impossible for them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4364)|
| 1:12:45| I just wanted to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| Carson and I, I think, are the two commissioners on the Veterans Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4369)|
| 1:12:56| I know Carson is honored, the same as I, to be able to have the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| This is a new committee that the TCSA has just put into place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| because of so many of our veterans that need to be represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4385)|
| 1:13:10| and a lot of laws that they've been trying to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| So I just wanted to add that I've agreed to serve on the veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| and the legislation and the education committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4398)|
| 1:13:23| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4403)|
| 1:13:24| I just wanted to say before Commissioner Bussler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| that they're looking to come here in 2018 or 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| I think it's 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| Yeah, it will be 2019 to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| and Visit Knoxville is working on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| so hopefully we'll have all 94 counties come to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4420)|
| 1:13:49| And to add, that's mayors, highway, and commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4429)|
| 1:13:56| Commissioner Smith has his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4436)|
| 1:14:01| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| I do appreciate you all being there and being active and involved in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| and it is important, but I kind of want to piggyback on what Brad said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| In the state legislature, things happen fast on the day of a bill comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| and there is no way that we can be there every day to guard these things as they go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4455)|
| 1:14:21| Sometimes you just need somebody there when it's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4461)|
| 1:14:27| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| I just want to tell you, and I want to thank the county and the county commission here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| for funding our trip down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| And I even went the year before I was even sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| Well, before I swore into office, I went to two meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| and I found out a lot of things going on down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| So just to tell you that we've always been real busy down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| When it started out in the first two hours, we had five meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| We had a membership committee meeting, a veterans committee meeting, a finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| transportation, and legislative committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| Then after that, you're divided into three groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| The three groups are the county commissioners, the mayors, the executives, the county executives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4503)|
| 1:15:08| and then the Tennessee County Services, which Dwight Vanderbilt came down and represented us real well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4508)|
| 1:15:16| Now, that was just another hour that we split in those other committees, so we kept real busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4516)|
| 1:15:23| We want to let you know that we tried to do as much as we could in the time that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| Then you also address issues, and it's already been mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| We address, you know, environmental issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| We went into the data and infrastructure surveys and how we can use those to best serve our county here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4534)|
| 1:15:43| And then we had one on maximizing the revenues for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4543)|
| 1:15:49| These things are, you know, when you start going to these meetings, there's so many information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| They broke down each committee that they were in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| and what they had learned to bring back to the county here to show what we were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| Then this was on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| Now we started going back to broadband issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| We had mitigating the legal woes, mitigating the legal roles here, energy management issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4566)|
| 1:16:14| and also how to deal with the aging and getting older in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4574)|
| 1:16:20| And the other thing is, too, what I used the time for for my end of it was a little bit of networking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4580)|
| 1:16:27| And I networked with some smaller counties, medium-sized counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4587)|
| 1:16:32| and then some of the other larger counties that were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| And what I'm finding out is the issues are all common to every county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4595)|
| 1:16:40| Now we have a person down there, his name is Charlie Curtis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| that's on the floor every day for issues that comes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4603)|
| 1:16:47| that we point out in our meetings before the legislator starts that may affect us that would come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4607)|
| 1:16:55| Now then we instruct Charlie to be on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4615)|
| 1:16:58| and he's made a lot of in circles with other members down there to let us know what's going to be affecting us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4618)|
| 1:17:09| If the county so sees, if they want to hire another lobbyist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4629)|
| 1:17:14| that's up to you all here and how you vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| But we do get that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| We spent time, we'll be going down there probably, what was the next meeting, I think, to go over issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4639)|
| 1:17:26| They're going to call that on the legislative committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| and we'll see some bills that we'll be introducing to that, and that'll be in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4648)|
| 1:17:33| And each one of us will be given certain bills that we need to go over and see how it's going to affect us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4653)|
| 1:17:39| So we'll also be working in that also as a lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4659)|
| 1:17:43| And I'm not talking for or against the lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| I'm just saying there's information there that we haven't been using,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| and we ought to at least utilize that right now, what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4669)|
| 1:17:53| But anyway, I do want to thank the county for this opportunity to go down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4673)|
| 1:17:59| This will be my third year, will be my fourth year really, of really going to these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4679)|
| 1:18:05| And if you have a chance, there are smaller counties that have 21 commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4685)|
| 1:18:12| and some of them have 18 there, and we had five there this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| which was real good since we got such a prestigious award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| And there again, we ought to be proud of our mayor and our services that went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| and gave us this opportunity to receive that in front of other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4704)|
| 1:18:29| So I really do appreciate you all, and I thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| And really, I enjoyed being with the other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| We didn't talk any business down there, but we all split up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4715)|
| 1:18:39| We were saying we need to go here, we need to go there, we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| And that was the best part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| We covered a lot more ground with a lot more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| So thank you all, and thanks for the other commissioners that went down there this time too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4726)|
| 1:18:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| I just wanted to follow up with one more recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| Dwight Vandervate moved up to be the first vice president of the Tennessee County Services Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4739)|
| 1:19:07| so he's next in line to be the president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| And next time you happen to see him in the hallway, you need to congratulate him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4750)|
| 1:19:15| But also I want you to know that his colleagues from around the state really look up to Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4755)|
| 1:19:24| We are very fortunate to have a man of his abilities working for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4764)|
| 1:19:30| But it was interesting to see some of the smaller counties coming up and asking him questions and what to do and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4770)|
| 1:19:38| And, of course, he's doing this all on his own time as well, serving in a statewide position like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4778)|
| 1:19:45| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| Any further discussion of the County Commissioners Association meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4788)|
| 1:19:54| If not, I do express my appreciation on behalf of the whole commission for those that did attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4794)|
| 1:20:01| and participate and brought back these reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4801)|
| 1:20:06| That would conclude our agenda today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4806)|
| 1:20:10| I would like to acknowledge that the county clerk's office provided a tour to county commission members today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4810)|
| 1:20:19| They went through the process of beer permits and applications, wine sale applications to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4819)|
| 1:20:28| I also gave a tour of the commission library where the minutes and resolutions of commission are maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4828)|
| 1:20:37| And also how the motel tax is collected, where we stand on that particular circumstance and situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4837)|
| 1:20:52| I would say that the tour was attended by commissioners Carringer, Nystrom, Daly, Thomas, Brantley, Schoonmaker, and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4852)|
| 1:21:03| There was no deliberation and there were no votes taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4863)|
| 1:21:08| And that will be the minutes that will be submitted as the minutes of that particular tour today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4868)|
| 1:21:17| I'd also like to bring to your attention that this Wednesday, as noticed back on October the 6th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4877)|
| 1:21:26| this Wednesday, the 26th at 11 o'clock, there will be a tour of the Roger D. Wilson Detention Facility on Maloneville Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4886)|
| 1:21:39| That tour will be conducted by Knox County Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| And it's not just for new members of commission. This is for all members of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4904)|
| 1:21:50| And I've been asked to give a head count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| So if you would raise your hand if you intend upon attending the tour of the Roger Wilson Detention Facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4913)|
| 1:22:02| that's this Wednesday, 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., there's going to be lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4922)|
| 1:22:09| So if you'd raise your hand, I see one, two, three, four, five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4929)|
| 1:22:23| Could the Commission Office please notify the Sheriff's Office that there will be five commissioners attending this orientation at the Wilson Detention Facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4943)|
| 1:22:34| And as I stated earlier, this will be followed up with a tour of the Sheriff's facility in this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4954)|
| 1:22:44| and the aviation facility that is also maintained by the Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4964)|
| 1:22:50| Those two sites will be at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| The Tennessee Technology Corridor Development Authority is going to have a traffic meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4978)|
| 1:23:03| It's Wednesday afternoon at 3 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| And in that meeting will be Knox County Roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| Also, TDOT will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| And the purpose of this meeting is to discuss Pellissippi Parkway, Hardin Valley Road, and that area out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4991)|
| 1:23:17| So if you would like to attend, we would love to have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=4997)|
| 1:23:24| 3 o'clock Wednesday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| I'm not sure which conference room it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| It says the large conference room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| So it may be MPC's large conference room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5011)|
| 1:23:38| Now, I realize that you may not be able to respond today, but you will be given a questionnaire within the next couple of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5018)|
| 1:23:45| The East Tennessee Historical Society has requested that we come and tour the facility and share a box lunch with them also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5025)|
| 1:23:55| That date will be December the 12th, if that fits well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5035)|
| 1:24:05| The other choice is the 19th, but there are other meetings closer to lunch on the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5045)|
| 1:24:11| So the East Tennessee Historical Society luncheon and tour December the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5051)|
| 1:24:17| Approaching noon, we may say 1145.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5057)|
| 1:24:24| The notice is not out yet, but we will have a notice out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5064)|
| 1:24:28| The question that's going to be raised, though, is I'll need to know who's going to attend so that we can give them a head count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5068)|
| 1:24:36| East Tennessee Historical Society, December the 12th, I'll say 12 noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5076)|
| 1:24:42| It will last for an hour and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| The reason that date works well is the audit committee meets that day also at 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5087)|
| 1:24:52| And then that's also the date of the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| So it's a threefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| Those are the things that I have written down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| Are there other announcements or other comments by my fellow commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5102)|
| 1:25:09| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| I'd like to make two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5111)|
| 1:25:12| Moreland Heights Elementary is having a harvest festival Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| And then I see that Fort Dickerson has a celebration this Saturday and Sunday at Fort Dickerson Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5116)|
| 1:25:31| Are there other issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| Are there other comments to come before we adjourn this meeting of commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5133)|
| 1:25:40| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5140)|
| 1:25:55| Thank you, my fellow commissioners, for your kind attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5155)|

| 1:26:33| Madam Clerk, the first item is actually a request to the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| Would you please read the caption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5196)|
| 1:26:43| And then before we actually get into the meeting, let me reiterate information that was brought to us earlier in the commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5203)|
| 1:26:51| that if there are persons present this evening on the last item, the Zoning Appeals 7N16RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5211)|
| 1:27:03| Commissioner Anders, what's to be the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5223)|
| 1:27:07| He's going to withdraw his appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| He's not here, but he asked that I withdraw his appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| I think I've spoken to everybody in the audience that was here on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5233)|
| 1:27:19| Withdrawal, take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5239)|
| 1:27:23| There is no action required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| Item 7N16RZ, a zoning appeal, has been withdrawn by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5245)|
| 1:27:34| That's the last item that's on tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| Madam Clerk, first item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| The first item is listed on page 23, 9-C-16-SP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5260)|
| 1:27:45| is a request of Metropolitan Planning Commission to adopt the 2016 Southwest County Sector Plan update for Commission Districts 3, 4, and 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5265)|
| 1:27:56| To reiterate, this is a request of the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5276)|
| 1:28:04| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| Thank you, Chairman Wright, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| The MPC voted 15-0 to recommend approval of the update of the Southwest County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5288)|
| 1:28:15| The sector actually includes a small portion of the city of Knoxville as well as a large portion of southwest Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5295)|
| 1:28:22| going from the river at Lines Bend west and south to the county line, the area south of Interstate 40 from the city limits west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5302)|
| 1:28:34| The sector plan is one of 12 plans for one of the 12 sectors in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5314)|
| 1:28:40| This is an update of the 2005 plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5320)|
| 1:28:43| There were some changes in this, and I'll go over those briefly and be happy to answer any questions you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5323)|
| 1:28:49| I would like you to know that the public engagement process is the result of a stepped-up effort by MPC to encourage public participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5329)|
| 1:29:00| and to get public input in our planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| There was a survey with approximately 250 responses, three neighborhood meetings, and five community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5343)|
| 1:29:12| We've changed the format for one of those meetings to more of a workshop meeting, and the participation of that was great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5352)|
| 1:29:20| and we will use that method in the future for other sector planning processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5360)|
| 1:29:25| One of the biggest changes in this sector plan is that a section of land south of I-40 and north of Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5365)|
| 1:29:36| and bounded also by Parkside Drive and Peters Road was changed from commercial to mixed-use land use designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5376)|
| 1:29:43| This was done to try to encourage the redevelopment of that area with higher-density commercial uses and also residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5383)|
| 1:29:51| Given the level of services that are available there, we felt that this would be the appropriate location for that type of mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5391)|
| 1:29:58| In addition, we realize that the county will continue to grow in the west sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5398)|
| 1:30:05| We need to provide opportunities for new businesses and for additional residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5405)|
| 1:30:09| We've heard loud and clear from the current residents of this area that they want to maintain the medium-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5409)|
| 1:30:16| to low-density residential development of much of the area and limit commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| Given that, this is the appropriate place for the higher-density commercial and residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5421)|
| 1:30:27| In addition, the other changes included a designation of zoning underneath the slope protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5427)|
| 1:30:35| In the previous sector plans, we just had slope protection area with no underlying zoning designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5435)|
| 1:30:41| making it difficult for staff, the commission, and the public to know what uses would be permitted in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5441)|
| 1:30:49| The plan also includes the updated sector plan land use designations, especially for commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5449)|
| 1:30:57| This resulted in a reduction in the general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| We tried to identify more specific commercial designations, such as neighborhood commercial, regional commercial, and highway commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5460)|
| 1:31:09| to alleviate the concerns that high-intensity commercial would be developed in some areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5469)|
| 1:31:20| The plan also recommends some actions for us to preserve agricultural areas, such as a conservation subdivision amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5480)|
| 1:31:28| a larger lot agricultural zoning, and an agricultural rural retreat zoning classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5488)|
| 1:31:36| We're working on that final classification now and hope to have an ordinance amendment to you within the next couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5496)|
| 1:31:43| We're trying to identify optional ways to preserve agricultural land, which is considered an asset in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5503)|
| 1:31:51| With that, again, the Planning Commission voted unanimously to recommend approval of the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5511)|
| 1:31:57| I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5517)|
| 1:32:03| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| Could you elaborate on any plans for any greenway expansion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5527)|
| 1:32:11| Yes. The sector plan does update the county parks and greenway master plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5531)|
| 1:32:20| and we have identified some areas working with the County Recreation Department for additional greenway designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5540)|
| 1:32:29| We use that as we work with developers who are developing properties that may include areas designated as greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5549)|
| 1:32:37| to ask them to voluntarily provide easements for future greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5557)|
| 1:32:44| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5566)|
| 1:32:47| I just wanted to say I think Jeff Archer did a great job with the meetings that he held throughout the southwest Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5567)|
| 1:32:55| and also the other team members that were involved. I thought they did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5575)|
| 1:33:00| It was nice having those in the schools so that people had plenty of places to park and plenty of access to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5580)|
| 1:33:06| Thank you. I'll pass that on. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5586)|
| 1:33:11| Seeing no further discussion, is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5591)|
| 1:33:15| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5595)|
| 1:33:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5598)|
| 1:33:22| The motion is properly before us to adopt the 2016 Southwest County Sector Plan as presented by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5602)|
| 1:33:35| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5615)|

| 1:33:41| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| Before we enter now into the real body of tonight's zoning request, let me reiterate, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5624)|
| 1:33:54| the manner in which the rules that we follow as we see these applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5634)|
| 1:34:05| The matter or the item will be called by the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5645)|
| 1:34:09| I will ask if the applicant is present and if there's opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5649)|
| 1:34:15| We will ask for the MPC's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| The applicant may speak. The opposition may speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| The applicant may rebut. The opposition may rebut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5663)|
| 1:34:33| County commissioners may ask questions during all of this period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5673)|
| 1:34:38| at which time the motion will be made in second and commission deliberations shall not be interrupted from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5678)|
| 1:34:50| I only do that just so that it's a little bit different from the rules that we run our other meetings by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5690)|
| 1:34:57| Madam Clerk, if you'd read the next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5697)|
| 1:35:00| It's 9-B-16-RZ, request of WBI Rentals LLC for rezoning from agricultural to RA low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5700)|
| 1:35:09| Properties located west side of Bob Kirby Road, north of Dutchtown Road in the 3rd Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5709)|
| 1:35:15| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5715)|

| 1:35:42| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, the Metropolitan Planning Commission voted 15-0 on consent with no public comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5744)|
| 1:35:51| to recommend approval of the request to rezone the 1.11 acre property to RA low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5751)|
| 1:35:59| The commission found that this would be a logical extension of the current zoning in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5759)|
| 1:36:05| would be consistent with the sector plan, and would enable uses compatible with the surrounding uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5765)|
| 1:36:12| Mr. Worley, do you wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| No, I'm satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5775)|
| 1:36:16| Do I hear a motion? I make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5776)|
| 1:36:19| I make a motion that we rezone the property per MPC's recommendation to RA low-density zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5779)|
| 1:36:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5785)|
| 1:36:26| Seeing no further discussion, motion is properly before us to rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5786)|
| 1:36:31| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5791)|

| 1:37:32| Voted 15-0, again on consent agenda, or excuse me, not consent agenda this time, but with no public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5852)|
| 1:37:41| The commission approved the sector plan amendment, adopting the resolution to amend the south county sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5861)|
| 1:37:49| to GC General Commercial for this 6.65-acre property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5869)|
| 1:37:53| The commission felt that the designation would be compatible with the commercial development in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5873)|
| 1:38:00| given the proposed rezoning of the property as recommended by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5880)|
| 1:38:10| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| Yes, this is within the growth boundary in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5892)|
| 1:38:16| I'd like to make a motion to recommend that the North County Commission adopt the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5896)|

| 1:38:38| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| The motion carries. Please wait a second, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5923)|
| 1:38:44| Item 9-C-16-RZ is also a request to LeConte Equities Group, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5924)|
| 1:38:51| for rezoning from OB Office Medical and Related Services to CA General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5931)|

| 1:39:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| The Metropolitan Planning Commission voted 15-0 with no public comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5951)|
| 1:39:16| to recommend that the Knox County Commission approve planned commercial zoning for the property subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5956)|
| 1:39:24| Again, the applicant requested CA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| The commission recommended planned commercial feeling that the need to review plans for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5967)|
| 1:39:35| to assure that access was adequate and to encourage the owner or developer to preserve some of the existing vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5975)|
| 1:39:42| and to buffer the adjacent residential properties would better suit the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5982)|
| 1:39:48| and assure adequate and proper development of this property with minimal impact on the surrounding community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5988)|
| 1:39:53| Again, the commission recommended one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5993)|
| 1:39:57| That condition was that no clearing or grading of the site may be permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=5997)|
| 1:40:01| until after the approval of a use on review development plan by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6001)|
| 1:40:08| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6008)|
| 1:40:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| Mr. Jarnigan, do you agree to PC and the one condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| Well, I'd like to request that we go back for the CA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6013)|
| 1:40:22| I talked with MPC and they said that there was a resident that lived behind the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6022)|
| 1:40:27| that has some concerns about the buffering that we would do to buffer their neighborhood from the commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6027)|
| 1:40:33| We're all in agreement with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| We were planning on putting a buffer in anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6035)|
| 1:40:39| I don't know if you all know, but there's been a new traffic signal installed by TDOT along John Sevier Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6039)|
| 1:40:46| so we're going to have access to the traffic signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| That's where the majority of the access for the site is going to be, to access the parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6048)|
| 1:40:52| and everything will face John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| TDOT has a concept plan that will connect that signal back down to Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6055)|
| 1:41:01| Now, that involves other people's property that we don't control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| but we'd like for the ability to do that into the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6064)|
| 1:41:07| if and when that were to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| But also, as far as the vegetation, we understand it's a scenic highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6071)|
| 1:41:16| and we want to preserve the particular area, but it was logged fairly recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6076)|
| 1:41:23| It was a lawsuit filed from a Mr. Mubarak who owned the property that adjoins it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6083)|
| 1:41:27| He was logging his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| They came on to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6089)|
| 1:41:31| The property owners that have the property now had to file suit against him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6091)|
| 1:41:36| So a significant amount of the large trees have been removed from the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6096)|
| 1:41:41| Like I said, we would accept the PC zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6101)|
| 1:41:46| but we would request that you approve a CA zone as long as we agree to put the buffer in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6106)|
| 1:41:53| Mr. Chairman and Commissioners, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| the Planning Commission recommended strongly 15-0 for the planned commercial zoning of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6115)|
| 1:42:02| While I know Mr. Jarnigan and respect him and appreciate his concern for the buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6122)|
| 1:42:08| please remember that the zoning goes with the property, not with the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| The owner could change, we hope not, but next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| and there would be no protection under the CA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6136)|
| 1:42:19| There's no plan review requirement for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6139)|
| 1:42:21| There are no conditions or standards for development other than the minimal standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6141)|
| 1:42:26| That is why the Planning Commission recommended planned commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6146)|
| 1:42:30| so that we could work with the owner and developer to ensure the protection of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6150)|
| 1:42:35| and adequate buffering of the surrounding residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6155)|
| 1:42:38| Kind of a point of clarification, is it the Cruz family on the map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6158)|
| 1:42:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6162)|
| 1:42:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6167)|
| 1:42:48| I agree with the MPC that this should be only planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| It butts up to a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| It's a neighborhood that's been there for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6174)|
| 1:42:57| It's a quiet neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| I cannot see granting GC here or general commercial or CA or general business, either one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6180)|
| 1:43:07| so I would like to make a motion that the County Commission approve PC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6187)|
| 1:43:12| planned commercial zoning, subject to the one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6195)|
| 1:43:20| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6202)|
| 1:43:25| Mr. Green, this property backs up to, it looks like, six residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6205)|
| 1:43:31| Did any of those six people come to MPC to oppose it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6211)|
| 1:43:38| No, they did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| I imagine they trusted us to make a good decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6220)|
| 1:43:53| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6233)|
| 1:43:54| Well, I think that brings up a, thank you, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| I think that brings up a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| If the staff recommended planned commercial with one condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6238)|
| 1:44:02| and then the MPC commissioners voted unanimously for planned commercial with one condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6242)|
| 1:44:12| originally the residents may not have shown up because they thought here's what the staff is going to recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6252)|
| 1:44:23| Seeing no, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6263)|
| 1:44:25| To make a clarification, this was discussed in the South Door Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6265)|
| 1:44:30| and we went with what we were told that what was going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6270)|
| 1:44:34| and MPC has done what they said they were going to do and it was 15 to zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6274)|
| 1:44:39| so I'll stick by the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6279)|
| 1:44:47| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| Seeing none, the motion that is properly before us is to approve rezoning as recommended by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6289)|
| 1:45:05| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6305)|
| 1:45:08| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6312)|
| 1:45:13| Thank you, Mr. Jarnagan, and good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6313)|
| 1:45:16| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| 9-B-16-SP is a request of Hope Davis for a Southwest County Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6318)|
| 1:45:25| from LDR Low Density Residential, SLPA Slope Protection Area, and STPA String Protection Area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6325)|
| 1:45:31| to see commercial in SLPA Slope Protection Area and STPA String Protection Area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6331)|
| 1:45:38| located east side of Ebenezer Road north of South North Shore Drive in the 4th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6338)|
| 1:45:47| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6347)|
| 1:45:51| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6351)|
| 1:45:57| Scott Davis, PO Box 11315, Knoxville 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6357)|
| 1:46:03| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6363)|
| 1:46:06| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6369)|
| 1:46:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| The MPC voted 12-2 with one abstention to recommend that the Commission adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6373)|
| 1:46:19| the resolution amending the Southwest Sector Plan to O office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6379)|
| 1:46:24| in lieu of the C commercial requested by the applicant, SLPA and STPA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6384)|
| 1:46:31| and for this one-acre site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| The Commission felt that while the property may not be suitable for residential use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6395)|
| 1:46:41| permitted by the current zoning and sector plan designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| that introducing commercial into this area, especially adjacent to existing residential uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6404)|
| 1:46:50| would cause impacts that would be detrimental to the residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6410)|
| 1:46:55| They also felt that the proposed office designation would allow zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6415)|
| 1:47:01| which would permit uses of the property that would be appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| allow the owner options for the development of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6425)|
| 1:47:09| while protecting the residential neighborhood surrounding it or adjacent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6429)|
| 1:47:16| And there was one comment from the public in addition to Mr. Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6436)|
| 1:47:20| from the neighboring property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6440)|
| 1:47:24| Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6444)|
| 1:47:27| No comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6447)|
| 1:47:28| I'll accept MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6448)|
| 1:47:34| Based on the MPC recommendation and having personally walked the property to see it firsthand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6454)|
| 1:47:39| I'd like to make a motion that we approve Resolution 9B-16SP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6459)|
| 1:47:44| amending the Southwest County Sector Plan to O office SLPA slope protection area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6464)|
| 1:47:50| and STPA stream protection area and recommend that we approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6470)|
| 1:47:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6476)|
| 1:47:59| Seeing no further discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6479)|
| 1:48:00| the motion before us is to adopt the sector plan change as presented by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6480)|
| 1:48:14| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6494)|
| 1:48:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6497)|
| 1:48:18| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6498)|

| 1:48:23| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| Item 9-D-16-RZ is also a request of Hope Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6506)|
| 1:48:31| It's for rezoning from A. Agricultural and F. Floodway to C.A. General Business and F. Floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6511)|
| 1:48:37| The property description is the same as the previous item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6517)|
| 1:48:41| I recognize Scott Davis as an applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6524)|
| 1:48:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6525)|
| 1:48:49| The MPC voted 12-2 with one abstention to recommend O.B. office zoning for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6529)|
| 1:48:57| as opposed to the commercial zoning requested by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6537)|
| 1:49:01| The reasoning for the office zoning was that this would allow compatible uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6541)|
| 1:49:05| that would not be detrimental to the adjacent residential use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6545)|
| 1:49:08| and would also serve as a transitional zone between the commercial further up Ebenezer towards North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6548)|
| 1:49:16| and the adjacent residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6556)|
| 1:49:20| You wish to speak, Mr. Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6560)|
| 1:49:22| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6562)|
| 1:49:23| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| Based on the recommendation of MPC and having personally walked the property area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6566)|
| 1:49:30| I'd like to recommend that we approve this zoning from A. Agricultural and F. Floodway to C.A. General Business and F. Floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6570)|
| 1:49:40| That was Resolution 9-D-16-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6580)|
| 1:49:46| The S.P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6586)|

| 1:49:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6599)|
| 1:50:00| As a formality before we vote, do you want to ask if there's opposition to this request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6600)|
| 1:50:06| Having not seen opposition to the former session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6606)|
| 1:50:11| the item that we're currently working, is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6611)|
| 1:50:17| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6617)|
| 1:50:21| Motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| Do you have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6626)|
| 1:50:31| Motion is properly before us and seconded for its request for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6631)|

| 1:50:39| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6639)|
| 1:50:40| Just a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6640)|
| 1:50:41| I think he said to rezone to C.A. and not O.B. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6641)|
| 1:50:45| To O.B. and not C.A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| To O.B. and not C.A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6647)|
| 1:50:49| I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6649)|
| 1:50:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6650)|
| 1:50:51| The MPC recommendation is O.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6651)|
| 1:50:58| And Floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6658)|

| 1:55:25| Please. I need your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6925)|

| 1:55:39| Wright. Oh, my brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6939)|
| 1:55:44| Please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| The applicant and I, who I am the adjoining property owner, have a disagreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6946)|
| 1:55:59| And that was why it was postponed last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6959)|
| 1:56:04| We have not come to any resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6964)|
| 1:56:09| And I have talked with the real estate agent that had the applicant's contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6969)|
| 1:56:16| And the real estate agent, Mr. Enzer, said that the contract had expired and the listing was no longer in process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6976)|
| 1:56:33| So I would recommend that that be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=6993)|
| 1:56:40| By rule, if the applicant is not present when the item is read, it shall automatically be placed at the end of the current agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7000)|
| 1:56:51| If the applicant still is not present when the item is reached again, then the item shall be placed on the commission agenda for the following month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7011)|
| 1:57:00| That's per our rule that I have read from Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7020)|
| 1:57:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7025)|
| 1:57:06| I know there was a lot of discussion on this property earlier because of the access through First Utility District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7026)|
| 1:57:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7033)|
| 1:57:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7037)|
| 1:57:18| So we're going to have to, unfortunately, delay this until the November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7038)|
| 1:57:23| But he could withdraw that in the meantime if the applicant would withdraw his application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7043)|
| 1:57:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7049)|
| 1:57:30| We'll advise him of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7050)|
| 1:57:34| Yes, Commissioner Bradley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7056)|
| 1:57:37| If the applicant is not buying the property, then what's the point of deferring it another month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7057)|
| 1:57:46| The applicant is not here to withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7066)|
| 1:57:49| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7069)|
| 1:57:51| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7071)|
| 1:57:54| I mean, we just can't take hearsay testimony at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7074)|
| 1:58:02| Commissioner Geale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7084)|
| 1:58:05| Can I ask what the two conditions are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7085)|
| 1:58:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| One of those conditions was that the First Utility District agree to the access easement to allow access to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7091)|
| 1:58:19| We do have a letter from the First Utility District where the Board of Commissioners of the district did agree to that access easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7099)|
| 1:58:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7108)|
| 1:58:29| The second condition was that the applicant will be required to work with the Knox County Greenways Coordinator for the location of the greenway on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7109)|
| 1:58:44| If between now and our next meeting we can properly be notified that it is withdrawn, it will be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7124)|
| 1:58:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7133)|
| 1:58:54| And that has to be word from the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7134)|
| 1:58:58| And if he doesn't, will it be tabled then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| If it's withdrawn, it's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7142)|
| 1:59:04| I mean, if he will not do that, what is the next procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7144)|
| 1:59:12| We have no next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7154)|
| 1:59:15| It will be deferred again and again and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7155)|
| 1:59:18| I do not make the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7158)|
| 1:59:20| I just read them to you or to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7160)|
| 1:59:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7163)|
| 1:59:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7164)|
| 1:59:25| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7165)|
| 1:59:26| Thank you, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7166)|
| 1:59:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7167)|
| 1:59:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7168)|
| 1:59:29| Commissioner Geale or, yeah, Commissioner Geale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7171)|
| 1:59:32| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7172)|
| 1:59:33| Can he do that in writing or does he have to come in person to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7173)|
| 1:59:36| He just has to send us a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7176)|
| 1:59:38| No, just in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7178)|
| 1:59:39| It's an email or a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7181)|
| 1:59:49| Madam Clerk, we need to back up one item to the – right, but we moved it to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7189)|
| 2:00:00| So now we've got to go back and see if he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7200)|
| 2:00:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| We will return to the next to the last item, which had been moved to the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7205)|
| 2:00:11| That's 4P16RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7211)|
| 2:00:14| It's a request of Hardin Valley Land Partners for rezoning from PC to OVTO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7214)|
| 2:00:24| properly located the southeast side of Hardin Valley Road, southwest of Valley Vista Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7224)|
| 2:00:31| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| Hardin Valley Land Partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7236)|
| 2:00:41| Seeing no response, the item will be moved to next month's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7241)|
| 2:00:48| No, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7248)|
| 2:00:49| We haven't heard from the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7249)|
| 2:00:50| I thought we talked about this last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7250)|
| 2:00:52| I'd rather just die from a lack of a second because he had requested two extensions and he got them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7252)|
| 2:00:58| This has been going on since summertime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7260)|
| 2:01:01| We talked about it last month that we were going to drop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7261)|
| 2:01:04| Yeah, so let it die for the lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7264)|
| 2:01:06| There's no motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7266)|
| 2:01:08| I'd like to make a motion that we take it off the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7268)|
| 2:01:11| I'm going to question the law director about the sentence that's in our rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7271)|
| 2:01:17| Well, your rules do say that if the applicant fails to appear that it's just going to be heard at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7277)|
| 2:01:24| I'm concerned about due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7284)|
| 2:01:28| If the applicant's not here, he may have the right to assume that it's going to be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7288)|
| 2:01:36| It may be appropriate for you guys, first of all, to look together to amend the rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7296)|
| 2:01:42| and specifically provide that it'll be deferred a number of times without the applicant being present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7302)|
| 2:01:50| Until that rule changes, I have concerns about the due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7310)|
| 2:01:58| I spoke to him and told him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7318)|
| 2:01:59| I said, after his last request, I told him if you're not here in October, then we're not going to hear it after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7319)|
| 2:02:07| So whatever the law director advises, but he needs to pull it off if he's not going to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7327)|
| 2:02:15| Madam Director of the Commission Office, you will assist me in preparing a letter to this applicant stating upon my signature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7335)|
| 2:02:24| that if he is not present at next month's meeting, this will be removed from subsequent agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7344)|
| 2:02:31| We'll get together on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7351)|
| 2:02:33| If there be no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7353)|
| 2:02:36| If there be no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7356)|
| 2:02:43| Commissioner Carringer's first, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7363)|
| 2:02:46| Well, I was just going to say, Brad, aren't we on the rules committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7366)|
| 2:02:51| So maybe we need to have a meeting and change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7371)|
| 2:02:54| Let's hold that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7374)|
| 2:02:55| We will address that thought in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7375)|
| 2:02:58| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7378)|
| 2:03:00| Okay, just to make sure I understand this, but we have to take action one way or another than next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7380)|
| 2:03:06| If he doesn't show up, we're going to have to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7386)|
| 2:03:09| We're not going to keep continuing on, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7389)|
| 2:03:12| I'm looking to the law director to see what's the result of my current action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7392)|
| 2:03:25| The thought of sending a letter and providing the applicant with notice that you're going to make a decision one way or another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7405)|
| 2:03:32| makes me feel better about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7412)|
| 2:03:36| Sending the notice doesn't put you in a position where you have to do it one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7416)|
| 2:03:41| It just puts them on notice that you're likely to take a position on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7421)|
| 2:03:47| And we will look forward to your guidance at next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7427)|
| 2:03:52| The issue that is before us now, let me reiterate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7432)|
| 2:03:57| that we as a board are notifying this applicant, Hardin Valley Land Partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7437)|
| 2:04:03| that if they do not appear at the next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7443)|
| 2:04:11| that their application will be dropped, not deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7451)|
| 2:04:17| Their application will be dropped from our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7457)|
| 2:04:21| If there be no objection, that's the action I will take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7461)|
| 2:04:25| Maybe if we worded it that there may be a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7465)|
| 2:04:28| and if the motion is seconded and voted on, it will be dropped or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7468)|
| 2:04:34| No, I would prefer that us just say they have to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7474)|
| 2:04:38| Then if they're here, we will then have the opportunity to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7478)|
| 2:04:42| Do not express that in the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7482)|
| 2:04:47| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7487)|
| 2:04:48| I look forward to the Rules Committee meeting on this because this drags on month after month after month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7488)|
| 2:04:53| and these builders are just playing games with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7493)|
| 2:04:57| They will come whenever they're ready,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7497)|
| 2:04:58| and they know that we're going to sit here and keep deferring all this, and that's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7498)|
| 2:05:03| It also might mean we'll vote against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7503)|
| 2:05:05| Well, I mean, we treated people who sold beer better than we're treating these guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7505)|
| 2:05:11| I mean, it's just they know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7511)|
| 2:05:16| Commissioner Buschler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7516)|
| 2:05:18| I just want to make sure that I got this clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7518)|
| 2:05:21| We've got a rule that says if they're not here to voice an opinion, then we go ahead and defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7521)|
| 2:05:30| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7530)|
| 2:05:32| If the applicant still is not present when the item is reached again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7532)|
| 2:05:36| then the item shall be placed on the commission agenda for the following month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7536)|
| 2:05:41| And that's our rule right now before it's changed, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7541)|
| 2:05:43| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7543)|
| 2:05:46| Do we put ourselves in a position now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7546)|
| 2:05:49| If we rule on that next month before we can make a rules committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7549)|
| 2:05:54| We will rely on the law director's advice at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7554)|
| 2:05:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7559)|
| 2:06:02| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7562)|
| 2:06:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7563)|
| 2:06:04| So we are on the July agenda, and we deferred it to the August agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7564)|
| 2:06:10| So we followed that guideline there, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7570)|
| 2:06:14| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7574)|
| 2:06:15| So then when it got to be the August agenda, does that mean then we start over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7575)|
| 2:06:20| Do we have to keep following that policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7580)|
| 2:06:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7582)|
| 2:06:25| It is on the agenda, and it is deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7585)|
| 2:06:32| Am I correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7592)|
| 2:06:40| That's our rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7600)|
| 2:06:41| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7601)|
| 2:06:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7602)|
| 2:06:43| So if we've already deferred it, it's dead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7603)|
| 2:06:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7607)|
| 2:06:49| I'm just offering some clarifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7609)|
| 2:06:51| Is this the first letter we will send?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7611)|
| 2:06:54| This is the first time this action has been taken in my history of being on county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7614)|
| 2:07:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7620)|
| 2:07:01| See, that's where the question then lies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7621)|
| 2:07:03| So every letter at this moment, you send that letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7623)|
| 2:07:09| Then we will send a letter to every deferred motion henceforth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7629)|
| 2:07:15| If they're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7635)|
| 2:07:16| Unless you change the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7636)|
| 2:07:18| I'm just saying as it stands now, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7638)|
| 2:07:23| Each item will have to stand on its own merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7643)|
| 2:07:29| Who is the chair of the rules committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7649)|
| 2:07:32| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7652)|
| 2:07:36| We will be putting the rules committee at the next work session, before the next work session, to address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7656)|
| 2:07:46| Before the next work session is the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7666)|
| 2:07:51| That's November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7671)|
| 2:07:52| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7672)|
| 2:07:54| Yeah, audit committee is in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7674)|
| 2:08:04| The question that's being raised is what action would take place if the rules committee meets at the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7684)|
| 2:08:12| The rules committee can sponsor a resolution before commission at the November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7692)|
| 2:08:18| But it will only probably be a rule that will affect applicants before county commission after the rule is taken effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7698)|
| 2:08:36| I believe that we're at the end of today's agenda for the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7716)|
| 2:08:44| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7724)|
| 2:08:47| Well, I just wanted to say we have a commissioner in our presence who has a birthday tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7727)|
| 2:08:56| Commissioner Evelyn Gill in District 1's birthday is tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7736)|
| 2:09:01| And she's actually wearing her birthday gift around her neck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7741)|
| 2:09:06| It starts like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7746)|
| 2:09:09| No, it's like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7749)|
| 2:09:10| It's happy birthday to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7750)|
| 2:09:14| Happy birthday to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7754)|
| 2:09:17| Happy birthday, dear Evelyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7757)|
| 2:09:22| Happy birthday to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7762)|
| 2:09:27| And many more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7767)|
| 2:09:33| It's tough being 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7773)|
| 2:09:36| She's like 35 and holding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7776)|
| 2:09:39| If there be no further action to come before the Board of Zoning, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161024?start=7779)|
