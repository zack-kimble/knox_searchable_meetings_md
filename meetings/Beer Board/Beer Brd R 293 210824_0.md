| 0:03:18| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| Hearing none, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=200)|
| 0:03:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=202)|

| 0:03:40| Sergeant Coward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| Missing fingerprints and background check on both managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| Since you're missing your fingerprints and background checks, we can't approve you tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| so we'll have to postpone you to the next meeting, which is in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=232)|
| 0:03:57| So that's what we'll end up doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| Are you okay with us doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| So this one will need to get postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| Do I have a motion to postpone to the September meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=250)|

| 0:04:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| We'll see you September 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=259)|
| 0:04:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| Next up is the First Tee of Greater Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=266)|
| 0:04:36| Garrett Thompson, 5474 Calvert Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| And Mr. Thompson, do you want to tell us a little bit about the Outpost Outdoor Concert Series?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| And I think we'll hear from you a few times this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| I'll try to get it all in right now, and that will save us a little bit of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| So I'm sure you guys are familiar that the last 18 months haven't been super easy for anyone who makes a living with events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=293)|
| 0:05:02| And so Born and Raised Productions, along with five other nonprofits, decided to come together to create an outdoor concert series where we could all benefit and try to get back into the swing of things together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=302)|
| 0:05:14| It's at a new location that's going to be beside the proposed site for a new music venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| Hopefully that will be coming in 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| And our goal is to enjoy live music together and raise funds for different local charities here in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=321)|
| 0:05:30| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=330)|
| 0:05:31| And I guess how much of the amounts that you're raising are going to go to charity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| Well, we have a – we worked out a deal where a percentage of the bar sales are going to them, but there's a guaranteed minimum that we're going to make sure that they get no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=336)|
| 0:05:46| So we're going to – we've already gotten sponsors involved to make sure that they're getting a bare minimum amount to those charities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=346)|
| 0:05:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Sergeant Coward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=356)|
| 0:05:57| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| Mr. Berg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| The file is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| Now, Mr. Frost, I think since this is a temporary outdoor entertainment, there are some additional requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=361)|
| 0:06:08| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| Yes, sir, Chairman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| It's my understanding that Mr. Ahrens had emailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| I've submitted the review application actually today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| So when I spoke to Mr. Ahrens on Friday afternoon, what was still needed was approval from zoning, fire, engineering, and building inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=382)|
| 0:06:34| as well as what Mr. Thompson just said he submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| So, I mean, what the beer board can do is move approval pending final documentation for this and the other events put on by the same group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=399)|
| 0:06:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| So I will move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| I've got a motion to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=417)|

| 0:10:30| But there's a site plan that they need to turn in, a location of where beer is being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=630)|
| 0:10:37| sold from, for example, and about the signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=637)|

| 0:11:45| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| Mr. Byrd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| We need the sales tax registration, building, fire, and health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=707)|
| 0:11:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| And Mr. Frost, this is for the subordinate retailers on premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| So there's still some other requirements that are needed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| So basically the same as last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| We'll move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| I've got a motion to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| I've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| Hearing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=735)|
| 0:12:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| You're approved pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| You've got one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| So this is for your on-off premise permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| Are you all planning on serving growlers that people could take to go or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| Not to our knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| So you may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| This is the original filing that you put in, which I think you changed to the other two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| when the common area subordinate came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| So do you want to go ahead forward with the on-off premise or do you want to use what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| you've got already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| I guess I would ask does it slow the process down at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| We're aiming to open in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| I think the only reason why we asked for it was when we were applied earlier, a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| places in the country were allowing off-premise sales of alcoholic to-go cocktails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=786)|
| 0:13:13| But I think in thinking of that, we thought it would be better just to cast a wider net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=793)|
| 0:13:19| But I don't know if it slows the process down at all because ultimately we're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| open just for normal business at the end of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| I can have Mr. Frost correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think it will slow down the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| and he got approval for any file documentation of the first two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| This is just one of the other ones that you had submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| So if you want us to proceed with it, we can go ahead and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| Yes, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| I want to check with Mr. Byrd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| Is anything going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| No, I mean I think there's no requirements that would differ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| I hope there would be less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| I mean if you get an off-premise permit and decide not to use it, that's your all's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| That's probably most likely what would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| Move to approve pending file documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| Oh, we need to get your name and address first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=850)|

| 0:14:14| Yes, same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| We didn't do that because I interjected there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| It's a name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=858)|

| 0:14:34| Mr. Byrd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| We need only the sales tax registration, building inspection, fire prevention, health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=876)|
| 0:14:42| Okay, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=882)|

| 0:14:50| So any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=890)|

| 0:19:04| We have a new construction crew that's in contract with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| so it's supposed to be done by 10-3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1147)|

| 0:22:42| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| Got 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| Nami Omakasa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1365)|
| 0:22:55| Tasha Matthews, 416 Clinch Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| Looks like you still need fire and health approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| How are you coming along?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| I mean, we're targeted for September 14th opening date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| As like everybody, we've had some construction slowdowns and labor slowdowns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| but we're on target to open now in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| So no extension is needed, correct, on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| I couldn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| So no extension is needed on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| She'll need an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| Yeah, an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| So how long of an extension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| 60 days is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| 60?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| Yeah, just in case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| Are you certain on the 60 or would you like 90?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| You can always turn it in early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| Yeah, we can do 90 and then, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| So I'll move to extend 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| I've got a motion to extend the 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| I've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| Hearing none, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| Got 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| Smoky Mountain Meadery withdrew their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| So that brings us to our administrative hearing for Cheddar's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1444)|
| 0:24:13| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| Attorney Tasha Blakeney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| My address is 400 West Church Avenue, Suite 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| I'm here on behalf of Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| I also want to let you all know that Michael Kirkland is here and present with me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| He's the general manager for Cheddar's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| Many of you are probably already familiar with Cheddar's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| It is a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| It does – it belongs to the Darden family of restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| operates restaurant chains that you're probably familiar with and know and love,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1481)|
| 0:24:47| in addition to Cheddar's, Olive Garden, Longhorn, and others in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1487)|
| 0:24:53| There was a prior violation at Cheddar's back from September of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1493)|
| 0:25:03| Fast forward 11 months and – I'm sorry, a year and 11 months, so almost two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1503)|
| 0:25:13| there was a second violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| So that's why we're here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| It is August 4 of 2021 that the violation that we're here about on this administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1518)|
| 0:25:24| So I wanted to point out it was a year, 11 months, and a smidge shy of the two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1524)|
| 0:25:31| And it's also worth noting that that initial violation, the one that occurred in September of 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| had not been one – it was one where there had not been a prior violation in the two years prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1537)|
| 0:25:44| Like many restaurants right now, it is also worth noting that the climate that we're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1544)|
| 0:25:51| there is just a significant amount of turnover and new employees everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| Mr. Kirkland, in fact, was telling me this afternoon, though he is the general manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| he is cooking in the kitchen almost every night in the shifts where he is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1560)|
| 0:26:07| They are extremely short-staffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| And that is not to make an excuse for a violation because Cheddar's takes it very seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| but they did want to give some context to the fact that they have very, very new employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| They are doing their best to keep their restaurants staffed appropriately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| and to engage folks who are very serious and committed to their mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| In this particular circumstance, unfortunately, the young man who made the error here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| he did check ID, he just miscalculated, made an error in this circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| He has been terminated from his employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| He has appeared in court already individually and taken responsibility earlier this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| He has been in the Knox County General Sessions Court, been requested to undergo some additional training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1610)|
| 0:26:56| so that if he decides to return to the service industry, he would be able to do so with that additional training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| But Cheddar's made the decision to terminate his employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| if they do want to set the standard that they have a 100% compliance requirement at their restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1624)|
| 0:27:11| In addition to that, you'll note in the remedial plan that was submitted August 4th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| it does indicate on there that there's a new process for servers to enter dates of birth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| but I wanted to expand upon that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| What is now required, and this is something that Mr. Kirkland has implemented since this event happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1646)|
| 0:27:33| servers, again, this is a restaurant, there is a bar service, but this is primarily a restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| and so servers are required now to key into the system using some new technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| the date of birth once they check the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| That date of birth is then submitted to the bartender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| The bartender then has another opportunity to confirm before even filling the drink order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| that the patron is of lawful age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| Then that opportunity also presents itself to managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| who are constantly floating around the restaurant space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| to confirm that if they see alcohol is on a table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| they can go to the same technology and the same system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| and confirm that that process has been followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| so that future violations hopefully will be extremely, extremely unlikely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1697)|
| 0:28:24| if not entirely avoidable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| They have also implemented a training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| They have made a video training possible for every employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1709)|
| 0:28:35| They have 95 percent completion of their entire staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| for that video educational program to avoid future violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| So since the event that happened in August, August 4th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| they have already gotten 95 percent of their employees trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| So Mr. Kirkland is available if you all have any additional questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| but I wanted to provide that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| so that the members of this body would know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| how seriously they have taken this violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| Thank you, Ms. Blakeney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| I'll turn it over to the other members to see if they have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1742)|
| 0:29:09| All right, I'll just review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| Go ahead, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| On the remedial plan guide, there's nine suggestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| and I see where you're doing six of them already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| I would ask how likely is the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| or is the owner willing to do the other three suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| that are on the remedial plan guide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1771)|
| 0:29:38| I guess there's three more boxes to check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| to lessen the possibility of future violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| Councilman, can you speak into the mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1785)|
| 0:29:52| Let me make sure that I understand which I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| Okay, so the remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| do you require your servers to ID everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| That is checked yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| Have all of your employees received server card training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| Since your citation, have you offered remedial training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| That is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| Number five, have you obtained a minor's reducing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| a major liability DVD toolkit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| I see that where you're referencing, Mr. Thomas, that is checked no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| but if you'll also note next to it, that's been requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| So that was something that has already been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| so that has been requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| Do you conduct in-house compliance checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| in addition to the checks conducted by KPD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| I'll be candid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| I'm not entirely sure what that in-house compliance check means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| other than perhaps if that means some additional efforts to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1839)|
| 0:30:48| Sergeant Coward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| That refers to your company actually sending in minors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| and trying to purchase beer or alcohol from one of the servers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| Okay, so apparently that is something that I'm assuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| that that is probably a corporate-based decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| I'm guessing since it is part of the Darden restaurant family, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1868)|
| 0:31:14| So that is not something that is currently part of their protocol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| but I do think that the new technology that Mr. Kirkland has implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| in this store would hopefully satisfy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| and make sure that what they're doing now, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| would make it very unlikely for future violations to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| But obviously, you know, if this board wanted them to try to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| a type of policy like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| I certainly think that they would be inclined to do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| if that would be something that would be important for this board for them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1905)|
| 0:31:51| Ms. Blakeney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| Councilperson Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| Thank you, Ms. Blakeney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| The compliance, the remedial plan from 2000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1922)|
| 0:32:09| I'm trying to see what the date is, the previous one, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| On number five, have you obtained a minors reducing a major liability DVD toolkit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| through MDC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| It says no obtaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| So the current remedial plan says no requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| So was it never received?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| You know, I don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| Maybe, because, again, Mr. Kirkland is the general manager now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| He's been the general manager only since June 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| So we're dealing with a different, June 7 of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| So we're dealing with a different management group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| Again, a lot of turnover in the restaurant industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| So I don't know, I would assume that it was requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| and perhaps received by the prior manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| who was at the helm approximately two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| But I don't know the answer of whether it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| So can I ask, is it possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| several questions have been answered regarding policy of the family group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1981)|
| 0:33:07| that owns the whole collective of restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| Is it possible some of these changes be instituted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| or discussed on a higher level than management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| so that when new management comes in that it's addressed then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=1995)|
| 0:33:22| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| And I bring this up because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| so in conversations I've had with MDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| one of the biggest issues that we have in our community is addiction issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| And we have little to no treatment options for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| And MDC is very focused on prevention as in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| and as a board and as an organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| And so that's why they make things like this available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| So they're trying to work with our community to avoid early, you know, gateway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| I hate to say that, but access so that we can avoid later addictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2033)|
| 0:34:00| and some of the greater issues we're challenged with here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| So I think it would be helpful if there would be some, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2043)|
| 0:34:11| a tête-à-tête with MDC to try and make sure this happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| since this is the second time to try and get this particular tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| to add to the remedial thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| And the other thing I just wanted to bring up for a pass to anyone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| that wants to bring anything up is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| so number eight on the remedial plan in 2019 and currently both say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2070)|
| 0:34:36| do you use point-of-sale software or portable ID scanners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| And the answer is no both times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| So you mentioned software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| Is there some change or something different that could move that from a no to a yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2084)|
| 0:34:50| Well, I don't think so because the way that I read question eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| is one where you're using, I guess it depends on how you define POS software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2096)|
| 0:35:02| the point-of-sale software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| I mean, it could be that that's appropriately answered yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| in light of what's been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| But the way that I read that and I was concerned about is the electronic check ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| the scanner, it is still a server's eyeballs who are going to be looking at the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| But then they're going to go and they are now entering that into the actual ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| And like I mentioned earlier, that is then retrievable and visible to the server,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| to the bartender, and to any manager who's on duty at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| So that is new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| So it could be that's a no and a half or a yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| I'm not really sure because it depends on, again, how you define that POS software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| But that absolutely is a new technology since this event happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| So your feelings are, and Mr. Kirkland, I hope I got that correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| are that there is some new software in place that will help prevent things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| Because I understand that it can be easy to do a miscalculation, count backwards, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| But I think we have so many technology option these days, I'm sure, I haven't looked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| I'm sure there's an app I could put on my phone that I could put your birth date in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| and it would tell me that you're eligible to drink or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| as long as I keyed in your birth date correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| And I know some restaurants have, like you said, double checkpoints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| where it's the server and the bartender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| And I understand that everybody's short-staffed and this is extra burdens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| but that's why I wanted to highlight, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| we have a community issue here with addictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| and that is why all the effort goes into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| is not to be like an anti-state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| but to try and prevent a lot of the issues that lead to long-term addictions in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2204)|
| 0:36:53| which is dragging us down in so many directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| Completely understood, and that is, of course, in part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| one of the reasons they terminated this young man's employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| despite their short staffing and he had, other than this slip-up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| he had been a valued employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| but they do want to set that tone for 100 percent compliance in their restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| You're back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| Ms. Blankney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| I would just strongly recommend that you consider number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| I think there's nothing like the real thing to test the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| All of these kind of create sustainable things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| You've done a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| I think you've done a comprehensive job of self-evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| but you need to test the system, pressure test the system as best as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| Very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| I will absolutely pass that along to the client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2267)|

| 0:37:51| Sergeant Cowern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| If you'll see me after the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| I'll give you my business card and be willing to help them set up in-house compliance checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2274)|
| 0:38:01| Thank you, Sergeant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| It's my understanding, Ms. Blankney, from what you were describing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| you have software that when a sale is going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| the employee will have to key in the date of birth for the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| You're going to have posted nearby what the age for 21 is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| And my question for you then, following up on that, is will there be –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| obviously the person keying it in will see this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| but will there be a second person reviewing that as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| So I know it's printed on the ticket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| so are you going to be requiring the bartender to be looking at that as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| That is exactly the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| So the server really just takes the order, checks the ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| then enters the date of birth into that software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| That is then sent as an order to be filled to the bartender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| The bartender is trained not to pour the drink| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| or pull the beer out of the cooler until he or she checks that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| That date is then posted in multiple places where employees are regularly found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| and, of course, very available to the bartender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| I think according to the file, has there been a fine that's already been paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| But the fine has already been submitted along with the remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| That was $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| So our options are to accept the remedial plan and take no action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| which will mean that in a rolling two-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| if there's another incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| then they will automatically go to a suspension revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| Or we can refer them to a suspension revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| I think this is a close case, but they almost got past the two-year time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2393)|
| 0:39:59| Almost is not within the requirements, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| We can't ignore that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| Looking at the suggested criteria that we talked about as far as remedial plan guide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2404)|
| 0:40:11| it seems like, in essence, they are meeting these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| or have a willingness to meet all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| So I think I would suggest, with input from my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| that we accept the remedial plan that they've submitted and take no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| I would second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| We don't need a second vote if we take no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| I would still second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| You're welcome to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| You're welcome to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| I like your spirit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| I'll see if there's any further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| If not, then we'll just take no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| I appreciate your time and your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| Seeing no further business before us, as is your board, then we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210824?start=2459)|
