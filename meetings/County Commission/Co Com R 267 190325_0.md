| 0:01:24| And Commissioner Smith is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=84)|
| 0:01:31| All right. All members have been noted who are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=91)|
| 0:01:34| And at the beginning of the meeting, what I'd like to do is ask Commissioner Carringer, would you mind leading us in a pledge of allegiance to our nation's flag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=94)|
| 0:01:43| Sure. Everyone please stand and salute our flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=103)|
| 0:01:49| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=109)|
| 0:02:08| Okay. The Chair will entertain a motion for approval of last month's minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=128)|
| 0:02:13| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| Okay. The motion's been made by Commissioner Gill, and the second, I believe, was Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=134)|
| 0:02:19| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=139)|
| 0:02:21| All right. All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=141)|
| 0:02:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| The next part of this meeting, for our guests and our applicants who are in the audience, at this point in the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=149)|
| 0:02:35| the Knox County Law Director will ask each of you to stand and swear an oath that everything that you say today in our hearing will be the truth and the absolute truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=155)|
| 0:02:47| So now I'm going to pass the meeting to the Knox County Law Director, Mr. Armstrong, who is two miles left, to lead you in this swearing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=167)|
| 0:02:56| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=177)|
| 0:02:59| If you're here today to testify before this, the Knox County Bureau Board, will you please stand at this time, raise your right hand, and be sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=179)|
| 0:03:07| Do you solemnly swear and affirm that the testimony you're about to give in this matter be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=187)|
| 0:03:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| Be seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| Mr. Chairman, they've been sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=197)|
| 0:03:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| Thank you very much, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=200)|
| 0:03:21| The first item on our agenda is a discussion and a possible action against beer permittees that are delinquent in paying their annual beer privilege tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=201)|
| 0:03:31| I have one item under this, which is the Fraternal Order of the Eagles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| It's item chapter number 4096 at 500 Andrew Johnson Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=216)|
| 0:03:43| They had an on- and off-premises permit, and they were in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| Is there a representative here from the Fraternal Order of the Eagles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=228)|
| 0:03:56| Again, is there a representative here from the Fraternal Order of the Eagles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=236)|
| 0:04:01| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| Seeing how there's no one here from them, perhaps we should send them a letter giving them notification that if they're not here next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=244)|
| 0:04:12| or haven't paid the fees by next month, that we will take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=252)|
| 0:04:18| Could the clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| Mr. Clerk, could you confirm that a letter was sent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| We send out an initial notice at the end of November, 1st of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=263)|
| 0:04:29| They were then emailed a reminder at the end of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| Their privilege tax is due by the end of January each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| They did not pay, so they were mailed a certified letter, and it was never picked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=279)|
| 0:04:46| Then, when they were put on the agenda for nonpayment, well, let me back up just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=286)|
| 0:04:52| They did send in their paperwork and their payment, but their business tax was expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=292)|
| 0:04:58| And so, therefore, we couldn't accept the payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| And I sent it back to them with a letter explaining why we could not accept their payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=301)|
| 0:05:08| They were then put on the agenda for today, and they were notified by mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| and also posted at the Andrew Johnson Highway address by the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=313)|
| 0:05:24| So, just to clarify, they did try to make a payment, but they hadn't paid the other part of their taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=324)|
| 0:05:30| so they weren't licensed to pay us, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=330)|
| 0:05:34| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| Go ahead, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| Just because this is kind of my first one like this, do we make a motion to revoke their beer permit or whatever action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=339)|
| 0:05:46| If so, I'd like to make a motion to revoke their license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| We'll make a motion to revoke, make a motion to suspend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=350)|
| 0:05:52| Suspend the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| You're revoking it to prove it's the property for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| Oh, okay. Suspend the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| Yep. So, would you like to make that in the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| Yes, sir. I'd like to make a motion to suspend the license of Fraternal Order of Eagles number 406 at 500 Andrew Johnson Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=362)|
| 0:06:09| Could you clarify how long that suspension would need to be in your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| I think until their taxes are paid. Can we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| Until their privilege tax is paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| Okay. So, to restate your motion, you're making a motion for their license to be suspended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| until they fully pay their business tax and their beer permit tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| Yes, sir. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| Okay. Is there a, before we have discussion on that, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| All right. There's a second on Commissioner Bigg's motion by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| All right. Mr. Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just a question for the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| Am I correct in understanding that their license has expired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=406)|
| 0:06:51| Well, technically, yes, but they still are in possession of the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=411)|
| 0:06:56| And when you ask that it be suspended until everything is paid, do you want that license picked up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=416)|
| 0:07:04| Okay. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| Okay. What I might ask the law director and the clerk's office, situations like this are not that frequent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=428)|
| 0:07:17| but have you all, based on past experience, is there any way we've usually handled this in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=437)|
| 0:07:23| Is this an appropriate recommendation by Commissioner Bigg's based on recent cases that are similar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=443)|
| 0:07:31| If we can recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| You have the power to suspend, revoke, or terminate any way you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| Generally, in a court of law, you will get a continuance for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=458)|
| 0:07:44| and get one more try to give them a bite at the apple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| That's a generally. It's not a mandamus. It's not something you have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=468)|
| 0:07:53| I can't recall whether we've done it this quick or not. Clerk, do you recall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=473)|
| 0:07:59| Well, in the past, everyone, even if they appear before the board, they pay, get everything up to date and pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=479)|
| 0:08:06| We've not had one that has not come to the meeting when notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=486)|
| 0:08:14| That's the peculiar thing is the fact that there's no one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| I mean, based on my couple of years of work on this board is usually you have at least somebody show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=498)|
| 0:08:28| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| Well, based on the testimony of the clerk's office, I think they did their due diligence in giving ample opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=511)|
| 0:08:39| Plus, when there's a notice actually placed at the business, there's no excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=519)|
| 0:08:47| I mean, they didn't call and say, hey, they can't make it to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| So I kind of agree with what the action Commissioner Biggs is taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=531)|
| 0:08:58| Okay. Is there any other discussion on this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| Can you please restate the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| Okay. Commissioner Biggs, would you like to go ahead and restate your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| I'd like to suspend the license until all of the taxes and fees are paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| Whenever that happens, we can reinstate at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| Since at the meeting, at this meeting, correct, Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=559)|
| 0:09:25| I would let the clerk receive their funds and then give them notice to come and report to you all the different things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=565)|
| 0:09:34| Even though she can do that, because they didn't show this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| I think they at least need to have some explanation to this board as to why they're in the situation they're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=578)|
| 0:09:46| You don't have to do that. You just ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| I like that. I'd like to do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| Okay. My head was turned over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| I saw Commissioner Jay's light first, and I wasn't sure who was here first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| It was Commissioner Gill or Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| Okay. Who was first? I was looking in this direction. Okay, I'll go ahead. Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| It didn't matter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| So here's where the process is a little unclear for me, because I know people, if business licenses do expire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=608)|
| 0:10:16| is the notification sent for your business expiration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| Because sometimes your license can lapse for years if people haven't paid it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| and then they just pay the fine that's owed on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| But they did understand the license itself was expired prior to paying their beer piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| Yes, and when they mailed it in, it was already, you know, the copy they sent was expired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=635)|
| 0:10:43| and I did write them a letter explaining to them that I could not accept their payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| because the business license was expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| And in the form that they filled out, it does ask for a current business license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=651)|
| 0:11:00| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Gill. I got your answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| Okay. All right. Go ahead. Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| Well, and that was part of my also question on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| For us to suspend, definitely suspend their beer license since they really have no business right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=671)|
| 0:11:18| So this is a really unique situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| And so would it be appropriate to ask if our North County Sheriff's Office could go out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=683)|
| 0:11:36| and check to make sure that no one is doing business out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| Because, you know, we had this situation back, what was it, maybe a year ago this past December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=700)|
| 0:11:49| when we had the business that was operating, but their beer license, and we had to go and pull everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=709)|
| 0:11:55| So I'm just wondering, has anybody been by to say, are they operating a business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=715)|
| 0:12:02| Are they, you know, selling beer right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| That's a question, I think, that needs to be asked and that needs to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=726)|
| 0:12:12| I thought the process was once we suspend their license, the Sheriff's Department goes out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| and notifies the distributors and they have to come get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| So we made that, did notify them, did post at the business a copy of today's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=740)|
| 0:12:28| Okay. So today with Commissioner Bigg's motion, we are authorizing the Sheriff's Office to go out and pull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=748)|
| 0:12:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| That's why I wanted to make sure it was clear to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| Absolutely. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| Seeing no other discussion there, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| Just as a point of clarification, do you physically, do they physically pull the license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| meaning if you don't have that physical piece of paper up on the wall, you're not allowed to serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| Now we have held license before until something has been, you know, corrected, whatever it may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=775)|
| 0:13:06| whether it be a codes violation or something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| and we have held the license until they have gotten everything corrected and then given it back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| Okay. Thank you very much for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| Okay. We've had a lot of discussion on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| It is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| We'll have a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| All in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=804)|

| 0:14:08| I'm going to ask you a series of questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| and remember now that you're under oath and you're testifying before this board, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| Have you or any of your employees at this location you're applying for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=855)|

| 0:14:28| or a crime involving moral turpitude within the past ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| We just took over the store, so I have no idea if anybody has done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| Well, have you got employees that are working there now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| And they were the same employees that were working for Lee, and now they're working for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| So you don't know the answer to this question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| Has beer ever been sold at this location before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| Okay. Is there an outstanding license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=903)|

| 0:15:11| The application is for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| E&S market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| Yeah, it's off premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| Off premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| Do you own the premises or are you leasing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| We lease it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| Do they have any interest in your business other than the leasing of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| Who will be operating this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| Who will be operating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| Myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| Yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| Are you familiar with the Knox County and Tennessee beer laws and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| and do you agree to conform your business with these laws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| Have you and your employees completed a server training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| I believe so, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| Do you know these employees have completed a server training program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| or are you going to have to go find out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| I'll have to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| We have two outstanding questions that need to be answered under oath at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| I can't tell you how to vote, but I think you have an incomplete application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| I was going to ask the law director what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| If you can't answer the question of whether or not your employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| or your management have not been convicted of any crimes of moral turpitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| or that they haven't been certified as servers through one of the vendors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=978)|
| 0:16:26| to sell alcohol in the county, we can't give you a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| Until those two things are true, I can't even give you a pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| I don't know how you come back unless he comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| and gives you a document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| Could he give you an affidavit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| Yes, he can't give me anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| He has to give this body something, and you all will have to rule to accept it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| You see what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| My recommendation, if you do anything, would be defer the application 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| and let him come back with an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| The only way we can give you a beer permit is if you're telling us under oath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| that your employees are certified to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| and that you know that nobody's been convicted of any violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| that would hold him restricting them from serving alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| I can find that out and have a certified letter from all the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| You're going to have to testify before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| I don't want to lie because I'm under oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| I just don't want to say yes because I'm not sure what the answer is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| I'll make a motion that we set this off until the next beer board meeting next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| so you get those answers to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| We have a motion from Commissioner Anders and a second from Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| Commissioner Jay, your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| Commissioner, before we do the vote, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| Yes, I understand that the gentleman should have been able to answer the questions before us today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| but at the same time I'm not sure it's right to hold him off 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| I wonder if there's any way he could do a sworn affidavit to the attestment that he turns in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| to the county commission office or to the beer board clerk with that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1082)|
| 0:18:14| Well, the only problem with it is you don't know what the answer is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| and it may be yes and that takes care of it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| But we could make a motion if the answers are yes, it's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| If they're no, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| You all can accept testimony any way you want to give it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| I don't know that there's any particular way that you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| Usually you have, he could go before a notary and prepare an affidavit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1115)|
| 0:18:41| That would be acceptable under some circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| It's entirely up to you how you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| This is your board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| I mean, I fully believe the man should have been prepared when he came here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| but at the same time I don't want to send any message to anyone that it's better to lie to us than to be honest with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1131)|
| 0:18:58| Oh, yeah, I totally agree that he's been honest with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| But he has to answer the questions how you all want to receive it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| That's a policy thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| Any additional comments, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| You all chimed in at about the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| All right, Commissioner Skinmaker, are you ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| I'm sorry, what did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| Your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| Both of you all's lights are on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| You want to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| It doesn't matter, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, because this is another procedural question that I'm trying to understand because this is unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1166)|
| 0:19:35| Is your name, sir, Ian?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| Say your name again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| My name is Salim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| Salim, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| Salim indicated on his application that the previous employees worked for the former business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1181)|
| 0:19:49| So the second answer to that question indicates somebody does have a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1189)|
| 0:19:55| And whether or not that license is up to date would probably be some directions that we can help him with answer that component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1195)|
| 0:20:03| Because that's what he indicated when he made that statement, that the former employees are now working for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1203)|
| 0:20:11| So somebody has had to have license to be able to answer both of those questions correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1211)|
| 0:20:17| Yes, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| Maybe, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| Number one, the license doesn't apply to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| That's what I wanted to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| And the second thing is just because they work there now doesn't mean that the current employee can answer these questions yes either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1224)|
| 0:20:31| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| That's what I just wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| You're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| Currently you're serving beer at the food market right now under the old beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| No beer now at the store anyways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| Because once we file for the application, we stop selling beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| Got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| Is there a manager at the store that's currently there that you can call and verify that they are all certified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| Why don't we set this off to the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| You go make that phone call and we'll call you back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| And what exactly do I need to find out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| Is everybody there certified to serve alcohol, beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| And has everyone been to the class to certify them to sell alcohol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| And has there been anybody convicted of any crimes of moral turpitude that would disallow them to sell alcohol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1284)|
| 0:21:30| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| Those are the two questions for all your employees and all your investors that are over 20 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| Yeah, I have three employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| Make those phone calls and we'll call you back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1298)|

| 0:22:04| If you could state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1324)|

| 0:22:17| Thank you, Mr. Reves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| You heard the questions I've asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| I think we've been here before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| Have any of your employees at this location you're applying for been convicted of any violations of the laws against possession, sale, transportation of intoxicating liquors, or crimes involving moral turpitude within the past 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1344)|
| 0:22:38| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| Has beer been sold here before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| The application is for on and off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| On and off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1369)|

| 0:22:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| And do they have any business interest in this other than the lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| Who will be operating this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| Mr. Victor Montes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| Victor Montes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| Are you familiar with the Knox County and Tennessee beer laws and regulations, and do you agree to perform your business in conformity with these laws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1387)|
| 0:23:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| Have your people and your management and employees completed their server training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| I'm going to ask the staff some questions now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| Health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1407)|

| 0:23:34| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| Is there a chair will entertain a motion from Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| Well, I've got a question before we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| Mr. Rivez, are you an owner of this business at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| Are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| Because on the application, your name is not on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| I'm the representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| I represent Mr. Montes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| Is that legal, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| He can send anybody as long as he's under oath testifying on their behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| It's just like being on the stand under oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1443)|
| 0:24:09| Let me see what the application says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| Does it say differently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| It just says Mr. Montes is the owner, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| It's an LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| It's an LLC, so any representative from that corporation, because he's not the corporation, Mr. Montes is not the corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1457)|
| 0:24:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| And under an LLC, you know, X number of people can own that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| So as long as he professes to be the agent under oath...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| And he is a notary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| He notarized the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1472)|

| 0:24:46| It says on and off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| Do you all just wish to have an on-premise beer license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| Do you want us to make that change to on-premise only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1491)|

| 0:24:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1495)|

| 0:25:15| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| Please re-approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1521)|
| 0:25:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| Did we hear from any of the employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| I spoke to the manager, and he said he's got the top-shelf beer class training that he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| done, and none of the employees are of any conviction or any crimes or anything of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1536)|
| 0:25:44| sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| Did we hear from staff on this one already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| So just, if you could, if you don't mind restating that you've got the key thing was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| no crimes of moral turpitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| You've got to make sure that no convictions, and you've got to make sure that they've completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| their training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| So if you could clearly state those that you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| The manager has taken the training, and the employees don't, because it's a gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| I'm not sure if the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| The employees will have to complete their server training program before they can sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| The manager has done that, but not the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| And then he's the only one that can sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| And if you're going to have the license 24 hours a day, or however you're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| running it, whoever is pushing the key and taking the money has to complete the server| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1585)|
| 0:26:31| training program before they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| Otherwise, your license will be in jeopardy, and you won't have it long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| So your answer is, is the manager has completed the server training program, and he will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| the only person allowed to sell beer until they complete the server training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| It's just like you have one owner, or one employee, and they sell the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| If you hire new employees, they have to go through server training before they sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| So all your other people have to go through server training before beer can be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| His training does not account for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| You understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| And you're stating that you, and that you have any of your employees at this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| they have not been convicted of any crimes against the sale, manufacture, transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| or possession of intoxicating liquors or crimes involving moral turpitude within the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1642)|
| 0:27:29| ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| That's true, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1650)|

| 0:30:16| us in a devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| And unfortunately, Daryl Arnold of Overcome and Believe the Church is going to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| but I'm going to give it my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| Bower heads, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| Heavenly Father, we come before you asking for your guidance, wisdom, and blessings as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| we begin this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| Help us to engage in meaningful dialogue, allow us to grow closer as a body, and nurture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| the bonds of community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| Fill us with your grace and remind us, Lord, we serve you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| We ask these and all things in Christ's name, amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| We're about to do the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag, and I know on our agenda it notes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| that Commissioner Anders is going to be doing it, but I do have some special guests here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| tonight that I would like to ask to help lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1861)|
| 0:31:08| It's Cub Scout and Weeblos of PAC 58.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| I'm going to ask them to approach the chair, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1872)|
| 0:31:19| I'd also like to invite their Assistant Scout, the Cub Master, and any other volunteers with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| the group to follow in behind them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| Okay, the flag's over here, so y'all go ahead and face me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1888)|
| 0:31:37| All right, just like we practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| All right, we're cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| So what I'd like you to do is tonight, Anna Taylor is serving as the leader of this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1900)|
| 0:31:47| Her mother, Jamie, is the Cub Master.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| Thank you, Jamie, for your dedication to helping kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| We appreciate it, but now I'm going to go ahead and ask Anna to lead us in the Pledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1919)|
| 0:32:08| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1928)|
| 0:32:22| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| And if y'all have anything you'd like to add, you're welcome to address us, but we appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| your dedication in coming to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| Now before we jump into the agenda, if we've got guests, we've got folks who may be watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| this meeting at home, and we have folks in our audience, this may be your first county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| So just to kind of bring y'all up to speed on how the meetings work, we have two meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1962)|
| 0:32:48| a month of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| Last week, we had the county commission work session, where we went through in great detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| the agenda that we have before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| As part of that work session, what we usually do is we'll take some of the items and put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| them on a consent agenda, which allows us to debate them and discuss them at the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| session, and then we place them on agenda so we can vote on all of them with one vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| So at some point in this meeting, the clerk's office is going to read all of those items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| that we've put on our consent agenda into the public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| We're then going to move forward for a handful of items tonight that we did not put on consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| that move forward for additional discussion or specific votes at tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| We also have as a regular part of all of our county commission meetings, public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| So we will begin and end the meeting with public forum, and I have one person that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2018)|
| 0:33:45| asked to speak to us at public forum, and that is Whitney Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2025)|
| 0:33:51| So if Whitney could please approach the podium and state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| Whitney Reynolds, 2220 McCammon Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| Five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| The clock up there says 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| So Whitney Reynolds, 2220 McCammon Road, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| Good evening, and thank you, commissioners, for allowing me the time to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| I'm here tonight not to oppose the BMX project located on the South Dole Middle School campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| but rather to represent the community of South Dole Middle School in our quest to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2065)|
| 0:34:31| that the most recent recommendations to complete our campus facilities are supported, carried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| out and delivered in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| At this time, I'd like to ask for our South Dole Middle School supporters to please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2079)|
| 0:34:50| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| Over the past two years, we've had ongoing meetings with the county commissioner, Carson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| Daly, with the Knox County Board of Education members, Legacy Parks, Parks and Recs, Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2099)|
| 0:35:06| and Knoxville BMX regarding the BMX project at South Dole Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| During these meetings, the negotiated plan was to relinquish the SDMS stadium, field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| and track for the construction of the BMX park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| In return, the school was specifically promised the following, an overhaul of the soccer fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2120)|
| 0:35:26| a high-quality running track with a shot put and discus circle, bleachers, fencing, concession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2126)|
| 0:35:32| stands and ADA-compliant bathrooms and sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| Even though the BMX project was underfunded, construction commenced mid-July 2018 and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| ceased a few days before the school year started in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2143)|
| 0:35:49| Now what's left at our middle school is not only an unusable field, track and stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2149)|
| 0:35:55| but also a very unattractive eyesore that parents, students and visitors must drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| by every single time they enter our campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| If you don't mind to flip to the next picture, I'd like to give you just an overview of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2168)|
| 0:36:14| Let me assure you that we take great pride in our stadium and our facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2174)|
| 0:36:21| And they were used very often, if not daily, by our physical education department, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| track and field team, our boys and girls soccer teams, our league football teams, our in-school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| field days, intramural sports and other community activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| Since August of 2018, our students' and staff's home has essentially been torn apart and disrupted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2196)|
| 0:36:43| Additionally, our school sports programs have been put at a tremendous disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2203)|
| 0:36:49| Due to the lack of facilities and even more so the inability of our students to access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| transportation to and from practices, we've seen a marked decline in our student participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| with track and field, as well as with our boys and girls soccer teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| Specifically, our school typically has three soccer teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| However, this year we only have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| In fact, our soccer team has to travel across town to practice at other fields and all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| our competitive matches are played at opponents' fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| Concerning our field and track and field program, which you know is a middle school sanctioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| sport, historically it's been one of our most highly participated sports at South Oil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| However, the numbers have dropped from 55 students last year to 34 this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2248)|
| 0:37:34| The major issue is that our students are being forced to train and practice in the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| lot of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| Not only is this an unfavorable environment due to the poor condition of the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| but it's also unsafe since the traffic continues to flow through the parking lot even after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| school hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| Mayor Jacobs has spent time on our campus and he's walked the ground several times and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| seen the effects this has had on our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| His decision to discontinue the BMX project was made with much deliberation, but was also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| based on quickly mitigating the adverse impacts on the SEMS students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| We want what was promised to our school and students and we stand in favor of Mayor Jacobs'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| decision to complete this promise by the beginning of the 2019 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| However, as I sat here last week at this very meeting, several concerns crossed my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| mind as considerations of rebids for the BMX project were discussed, specifically delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2303)|
| 0:38:30| Will rebids of the BMX project cause any additional delays with the completion of what's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| promised to our school and students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| Secondly, maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| If the BMX project were to come to fruition, who ensures that our county's investment of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| our new facilities and running track will be properly maintained and secured throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2329)|
| 0:38:50| And safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| Knowing that there will be times when after school activities and the BMX events will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| take place simultaneously, who ensures that the safety, who ensures the safety and security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| of our students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| For now, I'm going to put those questions aside, but I ask you tonight, regardless of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| any decisions with BMX, that you first and foremost put the needs of our students and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| staff at SDMS at the forefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| In addition, we ask that these promises be fulfilled to our school and this be done prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2357)|
| 0:39:23| to the start of school year in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2363)|

| 0:41:16| just a few updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2476)|

| 0:41:23| tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2483)|

| 0:42:17| updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=2537)|

| 0:53:00| Is there any debate or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| Have we had the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| So, Commissioner Andrews makes a motion and there's a second from Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| Excuse me, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| Alright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| Is there any discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3193)|

| 0:53:22| You're pointing at the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| I was gesturing to Commissioner...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| He was fooling me on the microphone use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| Commissioner Schoonmaker is instructing me to use the microphone when I do a second part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| They're complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| So, alright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| Okay, it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| Alright, do we have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| Once again, I'm going to say we got distracted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| All in favor, please say aye, just to clarify again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3226)|
| 0:53:47| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| Trying to work our agenda here, you know, these microphone questions kind of throw me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3228)|
| 0:53:54| off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| So, alright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| Alright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| Page 5801, regarding the issuance of not to exceed $36 million general obligation bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3241)|
| 0:54:09| of Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| This will be a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| We have a motion from Commissioner Anders and a proper second from Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3259)|
| 0:54:25| We'll now move to discussion on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| I also want to remind everyone who is here at the work session and those in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| at this point in our agenda, we're voting on some debt issuance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| When we discussed these items at last week's work session, we discussed all three of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| However, for tonight's meeting, each one of these three items will require a motion, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| second, and a roll call vote on each one of these three items on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3285)|
| 0:54:51| So, the motion is before us with a proper second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| Discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| We will have someone from the finance department will approach, but I know Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| I was just going to ask Melanie Wilk if there was any additional information that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3305)|
| 0:55:10| to be aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| Melanie, if you could please approach the podium and state your name and address for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| the record and provide any relevant updates since our work session on these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| Melanie Wilk, 400 Main Street, Knox County Finance Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3319)|
| 0:55:24| I'm here for Chris Caldwell, who couldn't be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| The information that you had last week, there have been no updates, so the plans and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3327)|
| 0:55:36| sources and uses analysis, all of those documents remain as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| If you have any questions on those, I'll be happy to try to answer those for you, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| there's been nothing new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3348)|
| 0:55:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| And I just think as we go through these critical items that affect our budget, can we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3350)|
| 0:55:56| say what this is, what the money is used for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| I mean, just a general overview because people have slept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| I think that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| And for the audience and for those at home, we have three items related to bond issuance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| If you could give us a brief update and overview on what each one of these is doing or related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3370)|
| 0:56:17| to what it's financing and the impact, the basic impact on our balance sheet, that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| be appropriate for this venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| The funds that we're asking for for the debt, there's basically two pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3385)|
| 0:56:31| The grand total, and we don't have an exact amount of the final debt issuance yet because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| we haven't sold the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| But to make round numbers, it's going to be approximately $50 million, essentially in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3398)|
| 0:56:44| two parts, approximately $36 million for new funding for the capital improvement plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3404)|
| 0:56:50| that was included in the 2019 capital plan and adopted budget that you all voted for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3410)|
| 0:56:55| already for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| So that's funding for those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| There's a portion of the two largest pieces go to engineering and public works for red| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| projects and for schools, and then a smattering of other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| So that's something that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| Typically every year we'll have our adopted capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| We need money for that for the long-term projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| So we'll typically issue bonds for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| And this is the normal recurring annual process for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| There are two separate resolutions on the agenda here, 1801 and 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3444)|
| 0:57:33| That's because of the legalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| There's an initial resolution and then just a resolution with a little more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| But they both pertain to the same thing, and they both pertain to the previously adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| capital plan funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| The third piece on 803, that's for refunding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3466)|
| 0:57:51| And what that one is for is there's from time to time opportunities that are recognized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3471)|
| 0:58:01| that we have some older debt that is in the process of being paid down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3481)|
| 0:58:07| And if that debt can be refunded at a lower rate and we can have some savings, we'll try to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3487)|
| 0:58:15| Now the opportunities for those have been reduced so that we can only do that as what they call a current refunding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3495)|
| 0:58:22| We've got about five or six years left on an issue that was done in calendar year 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3502)|
| 0:58:28| Our financial advisors' ransom numbers said that we could save over $200,000 by issuing refunding debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3508)|
| 0:58:37| So we've got $14.5 roughly million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3517)|
| 0:58:43| We don't have pocket change lying around to pay off those bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| so we would issue new debt to pay off the proceeds for the old debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| And it will reduce our cash flow needed for debt service by some amount over the remaining five or six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3530)|
| 0:58:58| It's a relatively routine process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| We've done those frequently from time to time, and there's really no real quirks in this one, and that's what that's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3541)|
| 0:59:10| It's basically like when you refinance your mortgage and you've got a better interest rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3550)|
| 0:59:14| and guess what, your mortgage payment is going to go down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| and that cash flow can be used for something else to simplify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| Okay. Thank you. Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| Okay. All right. That motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| That is, that's right, that's a roll call vote, so I'll go ahead and allow the clerk to call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| Commissioner Bessler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3573)|

| 1:06:08| The process we go through is, first, you have the personnel plan, which the law department has advised me, I know, three years ago when we did this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3968)|
| 1:06:17| that the ordinance has to be amended in order to update the employee handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| And then the employee lawyers, Mr. Morton, who's sitting over here, we know that this handbook needs to be reviewed and updated every couple years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=3983)|

| 1:07:21| Okay, thank you. The 11 votes, the ayes have it. It passes. Madam Clerk, Item 29, next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4041)|
| 1:07:29| Ordinance 19-3-102, amending Knox County Code, Chapter 6, Title 2, entitled Animal Control, to authorize a trap, neuter, return program for community cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4049)|
| 1:07:40| Ordinance 096-5-101, adopted 6-24-96. Ordinance number 07-12-102, adopted 1-28-08. And Ordinance number 015-4-101, adopted 5-26-15. First reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4060)|
| 1:07:58| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| Okay, a motion for approval has been made by Commissioner Anders, with a proper second by Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4080)|
| 1:08:07| First, right out of the bat, yes, Commissioner Gill, you've got a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. We have our public forum speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| Oh, we do. Okay, good. All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| What I'd like to do with this item is I've had two folks who'd like to weigh in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4098)|
| 1:08:23| By the way, I believe it was Tanner Jessel, is that it? Is Tanner here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| All right, there you are. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| What I'll do tonight on this ordinance, as we did at last week's work session, I asked if there was anybody both in favor and opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4113)|
| 1:08:42| And we've had, I know, two folks to speak to in favor of this ordinance that have expressed an interest before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4122)|
| 1:08:48| And Tanner, you'd expressed an interest for public forum to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| So what I'll do is, Tanner, I'll allow that forum to take place while we're voting on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4131)|
| 1:08:56| So I'm going to ask you to approach the podium, state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| And you'll have five minutes to speak to this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4140)|
| 1:09:14| My name is Tanner Jessel. I live at 1026 Olive Street in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4154)|
| 1:09:18| And I really don't like public speaking, so I hope that shows how important this issue is to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4158)|
| 1:09:25| And I'm taking off time from work to speak to you all, so thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| So as I mentioned, I live in East Knoxville. Commissioner Gill is my commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| And I try to keep my yard in a natural state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| I enjoy all the wildlife it attracts, reptiles, amphibians, birds, some species that I've never seen anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4177)|
| 1:09:43| It really hurts to see these animals killed by a cat attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| And I saw one just the other day, a bird killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| So I'm a board member of several conservation organizations locally and regionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4189)|
| 1:09:53| I studied biology at UT Knoxville. Most of my friends are conservationist biologists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4193)|
| 1:09:58| And my friends who are scientists and conservationists are generally opposed to trap-neuter-return programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4198)|
| 1:10:04| And that's because trap-neuter-release is not known to be effective at reducing cat populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| Think about it. If the average cat lives outdoors, lives three to seven years, and they live shorter lives outdoors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4209)|
| 1:10:15| why do these programs go on for decades?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| TNR supporters are hard-pressed to find examples where populations of cats have been shown to go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4218)|
| 1:10:23| for reasons other than adoption. So really, trap-neuter-remove works, not release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4223)|
| 1:10:28| A professional group of scientists led by the chief rabies scientist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4228)|
| 1:10:35| TNVR, trap-neuter-vaccinate-release, has not been shown to reduce feral cat colony populations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4235)|
| 1:10:41| because of low implementation rates, inconsistent maintenance, and immigration of unsterilized cats into colonies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4241)|
| 1:10:48| For these reasons, TNVR programs are not effective methods for reducing public health concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4248)|
| 1:10:54| or for controlling feral cat populations. Instead, responsible pet ownership, universal vaccination of pets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4254)|
| 1:11:01| and removal of strays remain integral components to control of rabies and other diseases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4261)|
| 1:11:06| So that's in the 2014 paper, Rabies Prevention and Management of Cats, in the context of trap-neuter-vaccinate-release programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4266)|
| 1:11:15| So I sent you last week my misgivings about the public health concerns, and we are talking about changing a law that affects public health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4275)|
| 1:11:23| Sometimes a law or a practice works so well, we forget why that law exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4283)|
| 1:11:28| So let's go back to why we trap and remove stray animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| It's because a century ago, rabies was common in the U.S. Hundreds of people got rabies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| So in response, we as a society got together and we trapped and removed stray animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4296)|
| 1:11:43| You no longer see packs of stray dogs running around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| This new program seems to forget why local animal control laws, why rabies laws exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4306)|
| 1:11:52| This is said to be a best practice, but it's not in keeping with state law on stray animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4312)|
| 1:11:57| Animals need 28 days to develop antibodies, and we're releasing them right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| Technically, we're releasing unvaccinated animals because they don't have any immunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| They're going to be outside potentially getting rabies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| In addition, two in every 100 cats never develop immunity because rabies virus vaccine is not 100% effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4329)|
| 1:12:16| If you're looking at 3,000 cats, that's 60 animals that never develop antibodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4336)|
| 1:12:21| They have an ear tip, but they're not considered current on their vaccinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| We can't vaccinate all the bats, all the raccoons, or all the skunks, but we can properly vaccinate all the cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4345)|
| 1:12:32| And this program just doesn't cut it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| In Florida, 16 rabid cats were found last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| Trap noodle return programs are thought to be to blame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| So let's take another look at what happens when we forget basic science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| In Washington State, measles is making a comeback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| You may have seen that in the news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| People forgot why vaccinations are necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| A boy in Oregon was hospitalized in critical condition because his parents did not vaccinate him for tetanus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| Science gives us a path to preventing risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| If government doesn't step in to manage risk, who will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| Please pause this effort to change the law until a thorough discussion of the important public health risks and consequences takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4384)|
| 1:13:14| Thank you for your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| Thank you for taking the time to join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| We have two other speakers on this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| One is Janet Testerman, the other is Laura Bluestone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| So I guess both of you will be, each of you who put your name in will get five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4406)|
| 1:13:33| And if one of you could, I guess, pick which one would like to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| You must be Ms. Bluestone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| Okay, if you could formally state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| My name is Lauren Bluestone, address 1526 Ripken Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| That's Murfreesboro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| I'm actually here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4429)|
| 1:13:50| I am the director of Metro Animal Care and Control for Nashville and Davidson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4430)|
| 1:13:56| We have implemented the trap, neuter, vaccinate, release program three to four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4436)|
| 1:14:04| And I will tell you right now that it is one of the most successful programs that we have to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4444)|
| 1:14:12| That is verified with statistics from reducing cat populations, especially in targeted areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4452)|
| 1:14:20| We have not received the complaints, nor have we had any major outbreaks such as rabies in cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4460)|
| 1:14:30| Actually, we haven't had that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| So this program, again, I am here to lend support to saying that this type of program works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4473)|
| 1:14:42| There are a thousand different articles out there that can tell you one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| And a thousand different articles out there that can tell you the exact opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4487)|
| 1:14:52| I am coming to you today to say that we have implemented that program in an environment very similar to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4492)|
| 1:15:02| And it is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| Again, I am here to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4504)|
| 1:15:11| As far as the legality goes, the law does state that the cats must be current upon release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4511)|
| 1:15:20| It is a little contradictory to have unvaccinated cats and not do anything, remove them, and have unvaccinated cats come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4520)|
| 1:15:30| There is no resolution there. There is no vaccination there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| At least in this case, the cats that are trapped are vaccinated, returned, and do prevent other unvaccinated cats from going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4533)|
| 1:15:45| So it does act almost as a safeguard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| That is very important to keep in mind, as well as the legality of it, which states that animals must be current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4548)|
| 1:15:57| At the time of the release, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| So, again, if you guys have any questions, this program is extremely successful in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4560)|
| 1:16:07| And, again, we lend the support here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| Okay, what we will do is, my initial plan is to have Ms. Testament follow her up, unless you have a question right now, Mr. J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4571)|
| 1:16:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. How long have you been running the program in Metro Nashville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| About four and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| And how do you measure success? Is it based on the numbers of intake animals or adoption, I mean, euthanasias?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4589)|
| 1:16:38| Both. But in this case, it is primarily intake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4598)|
| 1:16:42| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| Okay, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| What other diseases do you check the animals for in Nashville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| Is this cats or...?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| The ones that come in for, that are placed through our adoption, we do FIV testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4614)|
| 1:17:01| But the ones that are trapped near the release, we actually don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4621)|
| 1:17:06| Best practice is not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| It's physically sound not to test for those things, and we have yet to have an outbreak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4628)|
| 1:17:16| And that's consistent, not just through our program, but with other programs out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4636)|
| 1:17:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4640)|
| 1:17:25| Okay, Commissioner Smith, any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| Thank you, and stay in case there's any other additional questions come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4650)|
| 1:17:35| Ms. Testament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4655)|
| 1:17:40| Thank you, Chairman Nystrom, and to all the commissioners, thank you again for your consideration on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4660)|
| 1:17:46| I know you've been provided with all the data, the statistics, the dialogue, both sides of the debate of trap, neuter, vaccinate, and return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4666)|
| 1:17:55| And the bottom line is both sides agree that we want fewer cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4675)|
| 1:17:59| We just disagree on how we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| Trap and remove and ultimately euthanize doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4682)|
| 1:18:07| We put a Band-Aid on the symptoms for decades when we need to address the core problem of overpopulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4687)|
| 1:18:14| and the most effective strategy we have is through sterilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4694)|
| 1:18:19| So no other options other than what we've already been doing have been brought to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| Is it the perfect solution? Maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| But it's the best solution that's been proven in municipalities not only across the country, but around the world, and it's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4707)|
| 1:18:35| We heard, we obviously heard from Nashville the impact that it's had there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4715)|
| 1:18:39| You got Chattanooga, Memphis, Tri-Cities, Rutherford County have all implemented TNVR programs with a successful outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4719)|
| 1:18:48| We're not reinventing the wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| As I said to you last week, more than 650 jurisdictions around this country have implemented this program successfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4730)|
| 1:18:57| And as for the overwhelming concern with rabies, again, there hasn't been a cat rabies case in Knox County in over 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4737)|
| 1:19:05| And the fact that vaccinations are a part of our program, our commitment to sending cats out healthier than when they came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4745)|
| 1:19:13| we're creating herd immunity, and that's the best solution that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4753)|
| 1:19:18| We also promote responsible pet ownership, but as we've discussed, many of these cats, the majority of these cats coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4758)|
| 1:19:26| have no known owner or multiple owners or are feral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4766)|
| 1:19:30| So you've heard from many of the veterinarians, both locally and around the country, in favor of this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4770)|
| 1:19:37| including our own President Emeritus of the University of Tennessee System, Dr. Joe DiPietro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4777)|
| 1:19:43| who was also the Dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Florida,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| who helped start Operation Catnip TNR program in the 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| So if that's not an expert opinion and testimony, I'm not sure what is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| We don't want to be a part of a failed program, but we are immensely confident we will be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4796)|
| 1:20:02| We've already been successful so far after implementing it in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4802)|
| 1:20:07| And if not, let's reevaluate it in five years or sooner if needed as issues arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4807)|
| 1:20:12| We're certainly open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| And as you well know, constituents expect solutions, however imperfect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4814)|
| 1:20:18| and we know that more than 80% of people do not agree with euthanasia as a method of population overpopulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4818)|
| 1:20:26| So TNVR represents a vast improvement over the traditional approach of impoundment and lethal injection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4826)|
| 1:20:34| Although the latter approach has been used for more than 100 years in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| there's simply no evidence that it's produced any long-term population reductions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| and really is the poster child for failed public policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| We've trapped and removed forever, and again, it ultimately has resulted in high numbers of euthanasia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4845)|
| 1:20:52| So there's a reason that TNVR has and continues to be increasingly popular around the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4852)|
| 1:20:58| in community large and small, urban and rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| Help us get off the hamster wheel of repeating the same failed process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| and enable us to try a new approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| TNVR programs, they're common sense, animal-friendly, effective, economical, alternative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4868)|
| 1:21:15| and it's not better for the cats but for the community and the wildlife| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| that we all wish to protect, and we ask that you vote yes on this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4879)|
| 1:21:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| Okay, thank you, Ms. Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| Okay, Ms. Gill, you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| Is there a cost savings to this, and if it is, how is that money going to be spent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4894)|
| 1:21:43| So we certainly anticipate a cost savings on this for a few reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4903)|
| 1:21:47| The cats that generally, again, we take in roughly 5,000 cats a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| so the fact that we're able to bring these cats in, spay neuter them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| send them back to their known environment, we're saving on the sheltering, the food, the overhead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4916)|
| 1:22:04| but the longer that cats are in a sheltered environment, a stressful environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4924)|
| 1:22:08| the more susceptible they are to upper respiratory infection and other known diseases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4928)|
| 1:22:12| which we then have to treat before they're eligible for adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4932)|
| 1:22:18| And so that alone on the front end enables us to save money and resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| and then to be able to reallocate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| So that reallocation goes toward what we do is a number of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4946)|
| 1:22:31| It goes toward more behavior enrichment for dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| It goes toward our pet resource center, which we started over a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4954)|
| 1:22:38| which is really what we're doing to try and keep pets in the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4958)|
| 1:22:43| It is to help people that have hit financial challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| It is to help people that are struggling with keeping their pet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4966)|
| 1:22:52| We've taught this community we're a dumping ground in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| and we're working hard to shift that mindset and really through the pet resource center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| do social work for pet owners and, again, be able to reallocate those resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4979)|
| 1:23:04| So whether it's helping to provide pet deposits for pet-friendly housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| whether it's helping to provide low-cost acute medical care for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4988)|
| 1:23:13| that aren't able to afford those types of resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| So those are just a handful of ways that we would be reallocating those resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=4997)|
| 1:23:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| Okay. All right. Good question. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| Ms. Testament, will this in any way cause people to be less responsible as pet owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5009)|
| 1:23:38| knowing that they can go set out a litter of kittens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| and they don't have the guilt of them possibly being picked up and euthanized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5021)|
| 1:23:46| So we say that again. I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| I'm just wondering if it doesn't promote responsible pet ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| when people know that they can take that litter of kittens and set them out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5035)|
| 1:23:59| and they know they won't be euthanized so they don't have to live with that guilt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5039)|
| 1:24:03| Actually, what it will do, we need the community's efforts on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5043)|
| 1:24:07| So by passing this ordinance, it would allow people to come to the forefront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5047)|
| 1:24:12| and help us address the issue of overpopulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5052)|
| 1:24:16| So we need those community members helping us trap these cats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| bringing them in, taking them back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| Forever, prior to now, there are caregivers in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5062)|
| 1:24:27| that have been afraid to make themselves known as far as taking care of these animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5067)|
| 1:24:34| But really what it will do, it will get everybody in the same playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| It gives them permission to help care for these animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| So if they have a litter of kittens, they can come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| We'll fix them and send them out when they're old enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| But when we've got kittens or if we have a cat that's not healthy enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| if it's too old, if we know that it's lived indoors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| they aren't going to be eligible for this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5096)|
| 1:24:59| In that case, they will then be eligible for adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5099)|
| 1:25:02| Does that answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5102)|
| 1:25:05| Kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| I wasn't really asking about the people that are engaged in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| I'm worried more about the people that aren't engaged and see this as an easy out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5111)|
| 1:25:14| for getting rid of their kittens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| No, I mean, we don't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| We don't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| And Lauren may have an experience, but really what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5122)|
| 1:25:26| is, you know, again, it's really working with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5126)|
| 1:25:31| And, you know, we don't see them as dumping animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| When we started our managed intake program, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| where people have to make an appointment before they can just come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| and bring an animal to us with no questions asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| I'm not talking about bringing them and dumping them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5143)|
| 1:25:46| I'm talking about going somewhere beside the highway and setting them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5146)|
| 1:25:49| I don't see that. Do you want to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| So I will tell you, in the amount of time that our program has been in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| that hasn't happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| I mean, we get litters of kittens that are brought in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| But again, we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| mass numbers of abandoned animals on the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5171)|
| 1:26:16| We do not see that. We have not seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5176)|
| 1:26:19| And in fact, we've had areas where we've had 70 percent reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5179)|
| 1:26:25| in intake for cats because of this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| And it is not because they're abandoning them on the side of the road at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| Okay, so it does actually encourage them to bring cats to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5193)|
| 1:26:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5197)|
| 1:26:38| And where I was going with the managed intake piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| was that that was the fear, that people would just dump the animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| and then animal control would bring them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| But statistically, we track that, and there hasn't been an uptick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| when we started that program, and there hasn't been an uptick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| since we started it on the city side with that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5212)|
| 1:26:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| Jan, I have one more question for you, but I had a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| Bud, if, slim chance this happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5222)|
| 1:27:05| but if one of these cats that have been brought in have been vaccinated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5225)|
| 1:27:09| falls into that 2 percent that the vaccine doesn't take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| and it has a clipped ear, and it bites a child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| is there any liability on the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5236)|
| 1:27:22| Well, the county is always susceptible to any time we're involved in a program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5242)|
| 1:27:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| But the other side of the coin is that if the cat is not vaccinated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5248)|
| 1:27:32| and is bit, the cat, the child is in the same position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5252)|
| 1:27:36| If the cat is vaccinated, it reduces it to the 2 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5256)|
| 1:27:40| which is a pro-health issue in terms of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| and as a community, your job, part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5264)|
| 1:27:49| is to look out for the risk of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| And from what I'm hearing, it reduces that exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5272)|
| 1:27:56| I mean, there's a lot of statistical debates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| which I'm not going to get into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| but any time the county enters into a program of any time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| it gives us some kind of risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| But does it put us in a defendable position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| That's my question for you as a law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| Yes, we'll be in a defensible position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| Do you take a 98 percent program to reduce with a 2 percent risk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5295)|
| 1:28:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| And one last question, Janet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| And this is personal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5303)|
| 1:28:24| and I do my very best to keep my personal feelings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5304)|
| 1:28:27| out of the work I do on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| I had a cat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5310)|
| 1:28:31| His name was Alex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| He was attacked by a feral cat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| And this is why I've been asking about testing for diseases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5316)|
| 1:28:39| The cat that attacked my cat had a flesh-eating bacteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5319)|
| 1:28:43| and my cat spent three months in the vet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5323)|
| 1:28:46| And that's why I was wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| do we do any kind of testing to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| we're not releasing animals back out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5330)|
| 1:28:51| that have these type of diseases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| that could affect other pets or our children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5333)|
| 1:28:57| I can have our medical director speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| But to that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| every cat that comes into our facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| is not only vaccinated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| but is given a thorough medical exam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| to determine if there are potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| any symptoms of disease or any other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5351)|
| 1:29:15| Again, that would either make this cat ineligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| for the community cat program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| and or ineligible for adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| And I'll let Dr. Chassey speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5363)|
| 1:29:27| Hi there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5367)|
| 1:29:28| So yeah, I think that would fall into the category of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| Ma'am, if you don't mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5371)|
| 1:29:32| could you state your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| Sorry, Lisa Chassey, C-H-A-S-S-Y| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| from Young-Williams Animal Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5376)|
| 1:29:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5377)|
| 1:29:38| Medical director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5378)|
| 1:29:39| So anyhow, what I hear in that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5379)|
| 1:29:42| that it was an unhealthy community cat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| that attacked your own pet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| And, you know, I hate that that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| But that cat would come through our system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5389)|
| 1:29:52| and we would look at it and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5392)|
| 1:29:53| that's not a releasable cat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| That's not a healthy cat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| So I don't know of any particular tests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| for any flesh-eating-type diseases in cats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| that would be something we would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| But we would not release that cat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| Whether it be euthanized or offered up for adoption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| would just depend upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| whether we felt we could treat that condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| But it would not be returned to the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| Well, I guess my question is, how would you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| I actually tracked this cat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| and did bring it to Young-Williams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| and it looked like a perfectly healthy cat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| other than being very aggressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| Well, since flesh-eating bacteria is, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| there's a bunch of different potential causes of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| I don't really, again, know of any, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| tests that we would be able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| But hopefully the fewer cats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| and the fact that they're altered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| and less likely to fight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| that would improve or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| decrease the chances another cat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| would develop that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| And certainly we do recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| that people who have cats that go outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| should have regular vet checkups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| and be vaccinated for leukemia and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| But my cats stay inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| because I don't want that risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| But, you know, they may not be as happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| as cats that go out to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| Well, thank you. And I will support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| I just wanted to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| that all my questions were answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| And I would just add to that, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| going back to, you know, the spay-neuter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| which decreases the behavior to wander,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| which does decrease the behavior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| of fighting and being aggressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| So, again, it also plays into the behavioral issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| that are dealt with with free-roaming cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| Okay. Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| Are you good? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| All right. Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Janet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| you say that you, the catch and release,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| how many is out in the rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5500)|
| 1:31:41| percentage-wise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| Do you know the percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| between the urban and rural area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5505)|
| 1:31:47| I can't. I mean, do we have any idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| from a data standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| the analytics of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| Anecdotally, I would say it's about 50% county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| 50% city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| And rural versus suburban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5517)|
| 1:31:59| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| Yep. Ma'am, if you'd like to address this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| please step forward and state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5525)|
| 1:32:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| Thank you. Nicole Boudreau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5529)|
| 1:32:11| I'm the Director of the Animal Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| at 3201 Division Street in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| I would say our intake for stray cats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| is about 50-50 from the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| From, I think, a lot of these cat calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| do come in because they're complaint-driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| So you're going to have more concentrated areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| Are you laughing at cat call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| I, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5551)|
| 1:32:33| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| Just saw me laughing at him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5555)|
| 1:32:38| I was going to mention it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5558)|
| 1:32:39| and then I just figured I'd be mature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| but I'm not mature at heart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| so I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| Whenever we have complaint-driven calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5565)|
| 1:32:49| it's generally when there's more populated areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| So I would say tend to be more suburban than rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| But this program will span all of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| in addition to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| Well, the reason I'm asking that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| is I used to see feral cats come through our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| which we want because of the mice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5586)|
| 1:33:07| and the fields and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| Well, we got what we call coyotes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| a very big pack of coyotes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5591)|
| 1:33:13| I have not seen a feral cat in my neighborhood in years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5593)|
| 1:33:17| And you get them next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| they'll say, watch your cats and your small dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| because the coyotes are moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| And I just wanted to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| I mean, to catch one and euthanize it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| when there's two predators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| and I'm sure coyotes are in town now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| that's food source for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| So I'm with you guys at Trap, Neuter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| and Release so they can come back out to our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| and start catching all these mice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| that's got more diseases than the cats will, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| Okay. Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| All right. Back to Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| I need to know if we have specific cat colonies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5636)|
| 1:34:00| that you are aware of throughout the city that people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5640)|
| 1:34:04| and if you could speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5644)|
| 1:34:05| Because, I mean, I know with the release,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5645)|
| 1:34:08| Trap, Neuter, and Release of all these cats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| because I'm a huge bird fan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| I mean, there are specific pockets of colonies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| in the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| and if somebody could just touch on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| Nicole can speak to this too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| but we are tracking all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| We're also, there are other organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| feral feline friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| that are responsible for helping to track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5671)|
| 1:34:35| Trap, Neuter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| They do include caretakers in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5677)|
| 1:34:40| but as part of our community cat diversion program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5680)|
| 1:34:44| we have a community cat coordinator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| who's dedicated to working with those different groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5686)|
| 1:34:50| Again, it takes the community to really make this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5690)|
| 1:34:54| so we can address the volume of cats that we're seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| So we are working with some of those colony caretakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| and I'll let Nicole speak to a little more of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5701)|
| 1:35:05| So like Janet said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| we have a full-time community cat coordinator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| Christy Jarvis, who is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| and her job is to connect with these colony caretakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5712)|
| 1:35:17| Once the ordinance changed in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5717)|
| 1:35:20| we had such better reception with these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5720)|
| 1:35:23| who used to hide because animal control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| was seen as the enemy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| because they would take them and euthanize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| Now that that's not going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| these folks are more comfortable coming out and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5732)|
| 1:35:33| hey, I could use some assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| So we actually use a new database| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| that's a nationwide database that was recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| by Best Friends Animal Society called CatStats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| and you can actually go on there as a colony caretaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| and say, hey, I have this many cats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| and I need this kind of help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| and we will send somebody out to help without trapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| So we're trying to be very proactive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| rather than just reactive with all these cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| Seeing no other lights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| this is an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| It looks like we're ready to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| So this is an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| so this will be a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| So I'm going to ask the clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| to conduct a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| Commissioner Gill votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5784)|
| 1:36:26| Commissioner Carringer votes yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5788)|
| 1:36:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| Commissioner Nystrom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5793)|
| 1:36:34| Commissioner Nystrom votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| Commissioner Schoonmaker votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| Commissioner Anders votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| Commissioner Bessler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| Commissioner Bessler votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5816)|
| 1:36:57| So we have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| First reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5823)|
| 1:37:05| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| Page 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| Yeah, Madam Clerk, next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| Page 8, item 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| discussion regarding date and schedule of budget approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| One thing I wanted to bring before this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5837)|
| 1:37:19| is just trying to pick a day for us to vote on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| I know last year I think we did it on or around June 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| or that first week in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| I have not picked a date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| but I did want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5849)|
| 1:37:31| I know that there will be discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| especially during the month of May on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| And then for our new commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| what happens historically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5857)|
| 1:37:39| we usually have one dedicated meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| that is specific towards voting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| and passing the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| That's an important meeting, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| and I'd like to get it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| schedule it on our calendar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5872)|
| 1:37:53| So that we can plan accordingly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| because it will be outside our normal budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5875)|
| 1:37:57| excuse me, our normal meeting cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| So with that said, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| Yeah, have they announced the date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| of the budget introduction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| Are they introducing the budget to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| I have not heard yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| I'll look into the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| I know that when we set up discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| we thought Mr. Caldwell and the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| would be here tonight, but they had a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| So I do not have a date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| on when the budget presentation is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| Communication director is over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| Maybe he knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| Is Rob here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| Okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| I can't really see you over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5909)|
| 1:38:31| No solid date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| No date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| Okay, so we do not have a solid date yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| And I've had preliminary discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| with the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| and they most likely will do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| around April the 24th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| before they present it then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| because they have to get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| to the county mayor by May 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| But even if he does it that first week in May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5933)|
| 1:38:57| the first week of June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| probably would be an appropriate time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5939)|
| 1:39:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| Mr. Anders, your light is still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| Yeah, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| It really depends on what we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| because it's, you know, the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| I mean, there's going to be a lot of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| about the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| There's going to be a lot of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| and there's going to be a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| I mean, I don't think this is going to be a simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| The earlier we get it, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| I don't like getting it at the beginning of May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| because it goes into effect July the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| And so it almost puts us in a box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| to where we have to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| This will probably be the first budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| in many years that we look into it more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5977)|
| 1:39:42| because the future really depends on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| what we do in the next couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5985)|
| 1:39:46| And so I'd like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| hopefully we can get it before May the 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5989)|
| 1:39:52| so we can have an appropriate amount of time to debate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| And I don't think it's going to take one meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| It's going to take multiple meetings for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| to hash this budget out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| because there's a lot more needs than there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| discussed revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| Commissioner Jay and then Gil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| Is there a reason we couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6013)|
| 1:40:16| agree to a date in that first week of June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| Set it forth and convey that to the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| and say this is when we've set our date to budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| We need 30 days to approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| and let the backdating begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| of other public hearings and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| I mean, somebody's got to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| Somebody's got to dance first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| So I feel like since we're the body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| that has to approve the budget, we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| We could pick our date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| We should pick our date and let the games begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| I think that first week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| because they meet different weeks than we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| and also the school board's got different weeks than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| So you've got to pick a date that fits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| But then that first, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| I think the council meets on Mondays and Wednesdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6054)|
| 1:40:57| No, that's the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| They're on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| So pick that first Thursday in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| Probably be a good shot at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| But in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| That's June 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| That's a Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| That's the first Thursday in June, June 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6072)|
| 1:41:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| John, if you could check the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6077)|
| 1:41:19| In order of our lights, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6079)|
| 1:41:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| And I'd also like to point out that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| I think the school system isn't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6089)|
| 1:41:33| And part of the message that needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6093)|
| 1:41:36| communicated with the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6096)|
| 1:41:39| and looking at their capital plan salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6099)|
| 1:41:42| for pay increases for teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6102)|
| 1:41:46| and the impact of what is occurring now in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6106)|
| 1:41:51| how those numbers are going to trickle down and affect us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6111)|
| 1:41:55| I think we really need to stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| and have a critical conversation about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| what is occurring in Nashville right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| and how that will impact the budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6121)|
| 1:42:04| the capital plans that the school system may recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| and how we're going to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| If those scholarships or vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6129)|
| 1:42:12| or whatever the name that this administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| is recommending passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| what financial picture does that impact us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| And I think we are not very realistic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| in looking at the capital plans, the salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| the entire budgeting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6147)|
| 1:42:31| and the number of days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6151)|
| 1:42:33| a critical conversation around that will take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| And we are always in a rush| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6155)|
| 1:42:37| to approve these budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| without the appropriate conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| that need to take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| because of the timeframe that we set about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6164)|
| 1:42:48| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| Mr. Chairman, sorry to interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| Chief Harris says the budget will be delivered May 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| Okay. Commissioner Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| did you have any additional questions or statements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6183)|
| 1:43:05| No. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6185)|
| 1:43:07| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| Yeah, I was just going to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| and suggest June the 6th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| which is a Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6193)|
| 1:43:15| and it doesn't conflict with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| They would be meeting on Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| so we could do it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| 4 o'clock on the 6th or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| or whatever's convenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6204)|
| 1:43:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| Okay. So Commissioner Skinmaker suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6211)|
| 1:43:34| around 4 o'clock on June 6th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6214)|
| 1:43:37| but before we set a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| Commissioner Smith would like to weigh in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6222)|
| 1:43:44| I was going to say typically we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| at the latest since I've been on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| was mid-May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| And if we're getting it May 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| I think we need to have a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| where we have no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6235)|
| 1:43:57| We have discussions mid-May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6237)|
| 1:43:58| Leave time in case we don't get things resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| to have another workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6241)|
| 1:44:03| and then have a vote in early June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| So we probably want to look at a specially called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6248)|
| 1:44:11| I'm not calling it a chairman's briefing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| we'll have a special workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6253)|
| 1:44:15| just to review the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6255)|
| 1:44:17| May want to take place on kind of a day outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6257)|
| 1:44:19| at least my thoughts are kind of a day outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6259)|
| 1:44:21| of our normal schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6261)|
| 1:44:23| maybe a Thursday afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6263)|
| 1:44:25| if that works for this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6265)|
| 1:44:27| And I would think it would probably be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| to do that before our season of meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6270)|
| 1:44:34| start at the end of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6274)|
| 1:44:36| So maybe the second week in May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6276)|
| 1:44:39| is what I'm suggesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| if it suits this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| Is it the full week or the half week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| The 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| May the 9th, that's a big day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| You could do the 9th and the 23rd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6289)|
| 1:44:51| and then the 6th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6291)|
| 1:44:53| and that would basically give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6293)|
| 1:44:54| an opportunity every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6296)|
| 1:44:58| So we get it on the 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| 1st workshop on the 9th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| 2nd workshop on the 23rd if we need it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| and the final vote on the 6th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| and that would give plenty of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| for public comment as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| Will, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| will 9 days be enough time to digest and analyze?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| I think everybody will have their minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| With two meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| one on the 9th and one on the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| You're not voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| you're just discussing what you found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| Everybody will have a different point to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6324)|
| 1:45:26| I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| That works for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| Commissioner Skinmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6331)|
| 1:45:33| what are you looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| Yeah, I was also going to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| that the Finance Committee is going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| the same thing that they did last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6339)|
| 1:45:41| meeting with the school administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6341)|
| 1:45:43| as soon as the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| has been presented their budget to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6345)|
| 1:45:47| We're going to try to schedule that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| a couple days later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6349)|
| 1:45:51| so that will be done prior to the May 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6351)|
| 1:45:52| meeting to discuss issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| that affect Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6354)|
| 1:45:58| So what I'll ask this body is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6358)|
| 1:46:01| if we want to have a specially called work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| on May 9th and May 23rd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| would the afternoon work for most of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6367)|
| 1:46:10| and I'm going to throw out 4 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6370)|
| 1:46:12| as a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| 3.30, 4 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6374)|
| 1:46:16| would that time be agreeable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| Yeah, it'd have to be 4 probably on 23rd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6379)|
| 1:46:20| because most of us will be in Gatlinburg| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| for the Tennessee County Services thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6382)|
| 1:46:26| But we'll be back by 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| Okay, well then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| what I'll suggest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| I mean I can just call the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| so I will plan on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| and Drusilla,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| let's plan on the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| being on the 9th and the 23rd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| at 4 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| if we could verify the availability of this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| and make sure that once we verify that ability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| contact me to confirm it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| and we'll make sure these meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| are public noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| If you could work with me on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6414)|
| 1:46:56| And then you may want to add anything special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6416)|
| 1:46:58| related to the day of the 9th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| because most people know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| and I'm not sure if that's on the commission calendar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| but that's my birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6424)|
| 1:47:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6430)|
| 1:47:12| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6434)|
| 1:47:17| Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| we have a joint education meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6439)|
| 1:47:21| on the 24th of April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6441)|
| 1:47:23| and my understanding of the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6443)|
| 1:47:25| for that meeting is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6445)|
| 1:47:27| the school is going to give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| the highlights of the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6449)|
| 1:47:31| that they'll be proposing to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6453)|
| 1:47:35| So I wanted to let everybody know that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| so if you wanted to get an early look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| come to that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| And if you want to get a more comprehensive look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| watch the last joint education meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6463)|
| 1:47:45| where they explained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6465)|
| 1:47:46| how they did last year's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| in fine detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| with lots of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| Thank you for pointing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6474)|
| 1:47:56| That joint meeting is on the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| What time is that meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| 4 o'clock on the first floor room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| of the Andrew Johnson building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6482)|
| 1:48:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| I'm seeing a consensus on these dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| as it relates to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| but one thing we do not have a consensus on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| is the date to actually vote on the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| excuse me, the vote on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| One thing that was discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| was June 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| So do we want to come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6504)|
| 1:48:26| for June 6th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| another Thursday afternoon at 4 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6512)|
| 1:48:33| That will be the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| So Drusilla, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| work with me to get all these meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| on our commission calendar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| and all publicly noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| Thank you for your help on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6523)|
| 1:48:44| Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6524)|
| 1:48:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6525)|
| 1:48:46| Good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6526)|
| 1:48:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6527)|
| 1:48:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6528)|
| 1:48:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6529)|
| 1:48:50| That concludes that discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| I'm going to go ahead and jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| I spoke with Joe Holquist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| a couple of days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| Remember we talked about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6538)|
| 1:48:59| at the work session related to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6539)|
| 1:49:01| They're working on a law to allow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| and I'm going to simplify this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6543)|
| 1:49:05| much like we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6545)|
| 1:49:06| our central business improvement district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6546)|
| 1:49:08| to allow local communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6548)|
| 1:49:09| across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6549)|
| 1:49:10| to establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6550)|
| 1:49:11| transportation improvement districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| Joe told me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| they're going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6555)|
| 1:49:17| and as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6557)|
| 1:49:18| and John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6558)|
| 1:49:19| we'll get to your discussion item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6559)|
| 1:49:20| in just a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6560)|
| 1:49:22| that is going to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6562)|
| 1:49:24| in the current legislative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6566)|
| 1:49:27| assembly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6567)|
| 1:49:28| which is a two-year assembly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6568)|
| 1:49:30| but it's not going to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6570)|
| 1:49:31| in this year's session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| So it's basic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6573)|
| 1:49:35| That may have explained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6575)|
| 1:49:36| some of the confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6576)|
| 1:49:37| we had about the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| So the bottom line is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6579)|
| 1:49:40| this item requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6580)|
| 1:49:41| no discussion and no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| It's not going to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6583)|
| 1:49:44| in this current year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| but it will come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6586)|
| 1:49:47| in the next year's part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6587)|
| 1:49:49| of this particular session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6593)|
| 1:49:54| So that concludes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6594)|
| 1:49:56| discussion item 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6596)|
| 1:49:58| Go ahead, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6600)|
| 1:50:01| I just want to thank everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| for engaging in a great discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| last week about our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| long-term strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6606)|
| 1:50:07| planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6607)|
| 1:50:08| our roles and responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6608)|
| 1:50:10| and I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6610)|
| 1:50:11| everybody's willingness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| to get together for a retreat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| and to sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| give ourselves a rudder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6617)|
| 1:50:18| once again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6618)|
| 1:50:19| from a commission standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6619)|

| 1:51:25| Southeastern Conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6685)|

| 1:51:27| the members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6687)|
| 1:51:28| of the Arena Use Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6688)|

| 1:51:32| that we've lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6692)|
| 1:51:33| over the past few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6693)|
| 1:51:34| because they didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6694)|

| 1:51:38| So that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6698)|
| 1:51:39| hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6699)|
| 1:51:40| once the Governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6700)|
| 1:51:41| is on his desk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6701)|
| 1:51:42| once he signs that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6702)|
| 1:51:43| then they'll be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6703)|

| 1:51:49| legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6709)|

| 1:53:23| that's interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6803)|
| 1:53:24| for counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6804)|

| 1:53:30| elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6810)|
| 1:53:31| is that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6811)|

| 1:53:37| readily available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6817)|
| 1:53:38| on the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6818)|
| 1:53:39| website so it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6819)|
| 1:53:40| makes it easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6820)|
| 1:53:41| for all employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6821)|

| 1:53:48| I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6828)|
| 1:53:49| so I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6829)|
| 1:53:50| if it actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6830)|

| 1:53:54| So it'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6834)|
| 1:53:55| interesting to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6835)|
| 1:53:56| how the final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6836)|

| 1:53:59| Another thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6839)|
| 1:54:00| that originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6840)|

| 1:54:17| actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6857)|
| 1:54:18| it permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6858)|
| 1:54:19| local authorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6859)|
| 1:54:20| to regulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6860)|
| 1:54:21| the use of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6861)|

| 1:54:27| of employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6867)|
| 1:54:28| So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6868)|
| 1:54:29| going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6869)|
| 1:54:30| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6870)|
| 1:54:31| I guess they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6871)|
| 1:54:32| in preparation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6872)|

| 1:54:34| 2020 census| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6874)|
| 1:54:35| and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6875)|

| 1:54:37| redistricting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6877)|
| 1:54:38| that involves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6878)|
| 1:54:39| there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6879)|
| 1:54:40| but this actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6880)|
| 1:54:41| extends from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6881)|
| 1:54:42| 90 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6882)|
| 1:54:43| to 120| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6883)|
| 1:54:44| days with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6884)|

| 1:54:52| map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6892)|
| 1:54:53| So I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6893)|
| 1:54:54| they're allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=6894)|
