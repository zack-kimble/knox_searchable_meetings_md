| 0:02:20| Oh, good. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=140)|
| 0:02:24| Annie Clancy, 5313 Oak Glade Lane, Knoxville, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=144)|
| 0:02:31| All right. Thank you. Sergeant Hunter. No records. Mitchell. Or I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=151)|
| 0:02:37| We need the fire. Fire prevention and health department approvals. Okay. This is in District 6. Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=157)|
| 0:02:46| Yes, I'm going to move to approve pending final documentation. But I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| Fire away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| I want to ask about the school zones where it says elementary, the nearest school is Sequoia Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=172)|
| 0:03:00| And I believe Green School or Green Magnet is much closer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=180)|
| 0:03:08| But it's still 300 feet away or more than 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| Oh. All right then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| This is not something that the city has drawn up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=195)|
| 0:03:18| This is the school district and Green is a magnet school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| And so I think they do look at all schools, but specifically people who live in this area go primarily to Sequoia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=202)|
| 0:03:31| And what about the STEM school as far as the high school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| The zone for Sequoia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| Okay. It's still far enough away, but you're right. It should be the STEM high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| The STEM school is closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| Right. You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| Anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| We'll look at that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=224)|
| 0:03:46| Noting those inconsistencies, I'll second your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| I'm looking at the right one, but I have Clancy's is 259 feet from the First Presbyterian Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=231)|
| 0:03:57| Is that something that we've looked at or what do we do to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=237)|
| 0:04:03| Let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| Are you also applying for a TABC license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=244)|
| 0:04:10| I'm not really sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| You're going to serve something other than beer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=253)|
| 0:04:15| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| Have you made that application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| If he receives that license, it won't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| Then it trumps the city's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| It trumps the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| What we're talking about is that you're supposed to be at least 300 feet from a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| And you're 259, it says, from First Presbyterian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| But if you get the state liquor license, that will override our local ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=275)|
| 0:04:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=283)|
| 0:04:44| Wash your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| We have a special district which the dimensions are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| That's where you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=292)|

| 0:05:01| A number of years ago, it was changed for properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| I don't know the exact boundary, but loosely speaking, the CBID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=305)|
| 0:05:10| So the distance requirement is not applicable to those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| Well, they'll take care of the distance requirement with their ABC permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| But ordinarily?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| I believe so, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=320)|

| 0:12:33| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| We need the building inspection approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| I move we accept pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=759)|

| 0:12:44| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| And you can pick up your license from the business office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=772)|

| 0:12:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| Next is Nick's Tobacco Barn and Warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| This is in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| And there's an issue or four with Nick's Tobacco Barn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| But the primary one is that we received this afternoon an e-mail that the person wanted to notify us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=786)|
| 0:13:15| They could not come to the meeting because they're in Chicago, Illinois, due to an illness in the family and couldn't reach Knoxville in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=795)|
| 0:13:24| In addition, but before we do that, in addition, this person has also talked to Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=804)|
| 0:13:30| Do you want to share with us what you've learned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| Initially, the owner came in and spoke with my coworker and she sent in an e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=814)|
| 0:13:45| And she is requesting a delay of the meeting until September of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| I think there's some issues with the space maybe not being large enough and she may have to move to another location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| But that is the last word we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| But she did stipulate September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| And I did, when I e-mailed her to ask her to appear at the meeting when she sent me the e-mail about the illness in her family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=840)|
| 0:14:07| I did explain to her that that was pretty far extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| I didn't know how the beer board would feel about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| But I would certainly let her know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| I would like to ask, when you apply, is it for a site-specific thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=855)|
| 0:14:21| Since all of our inspections are that way, can you transfer the application to a different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| Mr. Cross?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| I think, you know, a beer permit is for a specific location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| And if you move it, you've got to go through the inspection process again to make sure zoning, fire, building, all the different codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=872)|
| 0:14:40| Because it looks like this person had touched the bases but might decide to relocate or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| I would like to move that we postpone this to the April 15th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=886)|
| 0:14:53| And persons should be deferred until then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| Persons should be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| And then they will either know by that time that their space is big enough or it's not ever going to be big enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=897)|
| 0:15:04| And so we can move forward at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=907)|
| 0:15:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| And that is referred to the April 15th meeting, which is tax day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| Next is the Ragin' Rebel Bar & Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=917)|

| 0:15:36| Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=938)|
| 0:15:38| We need a copy of the sales tax registration, the building inspection, fire prevention and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=938)|
| 0:15:44| police department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| I guess it's Jessica.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| This note we get about record checks and stuff shows that you have 20 outstanding citations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=951)|

| 0:16:00| Are you acting on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| What's happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| I have no idea what that even is, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| Sergeant Hunter, do you have any information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| If she'd like to see me afterwards, I've got copies of the outstanding charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| It's through city court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| We'd like to see you get that cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| I didn't know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=977)|

| 0:16:20| So, she has some outstanding things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| So, this would be approved pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| So, I'll move that we approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=989)|

| 0:16:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| If you need to speak to Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=996)|

| 0:16:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| The next one is the Scruffy City Hall, which has a great location for WBIR's webcam on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1005)|
| 0:16:54| the square because you look right into Scruffy City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1014)|

| 0:17:06| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| We need a building inspection and fire prevention approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| Now, this is for a manufacturing permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| They were here in December, I believe, got the license to sell the beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| but they're just not quite ready to manufacture yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| Is that the one that has the Department of Health inspection too or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| the manufacturing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| Yes, I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| So prior to us manufacturing, we'd have to have the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| and another building inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| Is that what I'm understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1057)|
| 0:17:39| The health department said you were approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| I don't think you have to go through them, but they did say you were approved today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| So do I hear a motion, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| And this has to be a pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| We'll get the building inspection clarification straightened out here tonight or tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| Because we already have a certificate of completion on the place itself right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1084)|
| 0:18:11| So is this a separate one that I have to get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| Did I call them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| Did you call them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| You know, we discussed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| You needed to call them and see if they needed to come back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| Oh, pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1104)|

| 0:18:32| When will we be ready to stop and get beer in our basement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| Look at the basement beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| It'll probably be a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| It'll take like four months to get the manufacturing of all the special equipment that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| and a lot of money that we spent on the building already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1127)|

| 0:18:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| Similar to the Scruffy City Hall logo that's on the door right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| It's just going to say Scruffy City Brewery instead of Scruffy City Hall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| and be more of a hoppy color, green hops in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1140)|

| 0:21:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| This is the second offense from this establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| The first was on November 30th, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| One of the persons who sold had their charges dismissed with community service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1318)|
| 0:22:05| This is the second sale on January 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| They did not card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| And we have their original remedial plan that they submitted to KPD was to install ID scanners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1330)|
| 0:22:19| to replace the nonworking unit that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| They were going to also be sure that everybody carded before they sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| And they were going to take a final step, and that was require all new employees to attend the task program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1347)|
| 0:22:34| Something about that didn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| So now they come back for a second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| And this time they say they are going to send all their new employees to the task program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1359)|
| 0:22:47| Did you do that the first time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| But this time the problem was my wife, she just moved India to here, and she don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| and I just go outside and she got ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| Well, you're very responsible for what goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| A third case on this would not be such a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| Is there any discussion on the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| These are our options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| What are the options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| The options are to take no further action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| The second option is to send the matter to the suspension revocation hearing to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1401)|
| 0:23:29| Those are two choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| If we don't want to do anything else, then we don't need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| If we want to send it to the hearing officer, then we need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| Counsel Mandela-Vopay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| Is the letter in this file, that's their remedial plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| Is that the three steps that you were going to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| Take the alcohol service course, instruct the employees on how to operate the licensing machine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1426)|
| 0:23:52| and checking IDs for date of birth, is that what you plan to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| Did you have any of that in place before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| Weekly meetings, did you have weekly meetings before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| It says we'll hold weekly meetings stressing the importance of checking IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| Are you doing that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| How many servers do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| Only one right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| Only one server?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| Yeah, and I work myself, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| So two people operate the store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| So, again, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| Counselman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| I make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| Since it's happened twice in 18 months, less than 18 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| I make a motion that we send it back to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| Counselman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Stair, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| I'll second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| I'm just a little concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| There's an establishment here called Discount Puffs and Ale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| and the person in charge didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| You said that she didn't know that they had to be 21 to buy alcohol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| Yes, sir, because she just moved India to here a couple months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| and she never work anywhere, and she has a little bit language problem, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| And I just go somewhere else to just say, hey, just stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| And I come back, and she already got tiki.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| That's really unacceptable, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| I mean, you cannot leave someone in charge of a store that sells alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| and they don't understand that people have to be 21 to sell alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| That's your responsibility as the owner, and that's unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| So I'll move to second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| I'll second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| All those in favor of sending this to the hearing officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| You will be getting more information about appearing before the hearing officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| and that will be within the next few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| It will be within a month or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| Please be sure that everybody who's working there understands that you have to card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| you have to know the date, and if you put these things in place, that they've got to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| And this is a TABC hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| Latitude 35, a TABC hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| Meaning they had one and referred it to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| No, it means that this is their third offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| TABC has fined them and suspended their license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| and now we have to move it to the hearing officer to take action because of the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1595)|
| 0:26:42| So we don't have anybody here from Latitude 35, apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| You need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| I need a motion to send this to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| So Latitude 35 will be sent to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| Does that mean is their license revoked now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| No, their license is neither revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| They've served the TABC penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| So they're back in business for the time being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| They've had three citations in, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| Three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| In three years, and that's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| So while I think, did Chipotle ever come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| I didn't see anybody come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| Are we at the bottom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| We need to vote on the Latitude 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| All those in favor of sending it to the hearing officer say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| And Chipotle, I guess we're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| Chipotle, I think we need to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| Let's postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| I'll make a motion to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| So approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| Now, is there anything else anybody else has?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| I have a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| As you know, Sergeant Hunter was really busy with the compliance checks recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| and we have noticed increasingly numbers of people who check IDs and then sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1683)|
| 0:28:10| I don't understand how you do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| and I know that there's some people from the Metropolitan Drug Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| they don't understand it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| So we will need to be taking a look at some of the places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| One of the places who sold recently, this was like their third time in a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| Some of these were pretty big establishments too, not just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| a hole in the wall mom and pops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| They should know better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| When we were on the task force with the Drug Commission looking at sales to minors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1712)|
| 0:28:38| I assumed that it would be small, like mom and pops, who were the biggest violators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1718)|
| 0:28:44| So when we sat down and analyzed the data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| it was the people who are primarily bars and restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| who have to have the highest level of training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| So I'm not quite sure what we need to do or where we need to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| but we'll be headed in that direction when we figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Sergeant Hunter, I've just been on this body, I guess, over two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| It seems like is the problem getting worse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| Can you give us any perspective on are more of our establishments violating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1750)|
| 0:29:18| I've been in the unit just short of four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| and it seems like up until this year it had been getting better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| and for some reason since January we're just below 50% for our rate of sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1764)|
| 0:29:30| So just less than half of the businesses we're visiting are violating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| What's typical?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| It was 33% for the bars and, like, 21% for convenience stores or, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1777)|
| 0:29:48| So there was a significant uptick recently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| Yes, starting with the stings we did in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1791)|

| 0:29:56| Cold weather sends people to drink?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| I guess that must do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1798)|

| 0:30:02| Colonel Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1802)|

| 0:30:12| Or does everything still have to come through us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| It always has to come through us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| and we send it three times within two years and it's automatic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| and we have some discretion on the second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1821)|

| 0:30:36| That suspension is over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| and the fine came at a time when there was possibly not as much action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1838)|
| 0:30:43| We had serious cold weather, and so it probably wasn't as hurtful as it might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1843)|
| 0:30:49| Any other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-140318?start=1849)|
