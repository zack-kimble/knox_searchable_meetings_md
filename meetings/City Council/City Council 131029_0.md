| 0:03:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| Last night, actually, about this hour, we lost an officer to a motorcycle crash over in Sevierville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=192)|
| 0:03:20| Officer David Munson has been with the police department since July of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=200)|
| 0:03:28| Officer David Munson has survived by his wife and his parents and two brothers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=208)|
| 0:03:38| He worked very hard for this community, did a wonderful job, was a fine young man, a wonderful officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=218)|
| 0:03:48| The arrangements that I just received on Thursday evening from 5 to 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=228)|
| 0:03:56| We'll be receiving friends and family at Chilhowee Hills Baptist Church, 4615 Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=236)|
| 0:04:04| Funeral service will be Friday at 11 a.m. at the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| And the procession following will proceed by the KPD en route to his final resting place in Seymour behind the Ashley Funeral Home there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=248)|
| 0:04:21| So we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| We've had lots of calls of support from the community, from our partners, and we very much appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=264)|
| 0:04:32| And I want to let Council know I spoke with Officer Munson's father and with his wife this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=272)|
| 0:04:39| And I know his wife, Christina, said she was just overwhelmed with the showing of support from KPD and others in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=279)|
| 0:04:47| and they were very grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| So I'm going to ask before we're going to have the invocation given by Councilman Della Vopi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=289)|
| 0:04:55| and the Pledge of Allegiance led by Finbar Saunders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| let's stand for a moment of silence in memory of Officer Munson and thinking of his family as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=298)|
| 0:05:20| Heavenly Father, thank you for this blessed day and the opportunity to save the beauty of our East Tennessee countryside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=320)|

| 0:05:44| Let us be thinking about all of our uniformed bodies as they go about their business in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=344)|
| 0:05:52| And as Council people, let us treat all who come before us with dignity and respect and fairness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=352)|
| 0:06:00| and keep us ever mindful of those less fortunate than ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=360)|

| 0:06:47| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=410)|

| 0:06:54| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| And I'm going to ask Mr. Swanson if he'll also expound on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| but I'd like to make a motion to withdraw 12D, E, and F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=423)|
| 0:07:10| Mr. Swanson, do you want to explain why we're doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| I will expound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| Expound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| Explain or expound, whichever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| In the zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| it provides with respect to amendments to the zoning code under Article 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=443)|
| 0:07:30| Section 6D provides that all amendments initiated by application filed with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=450)|
| 0:07:37| Metropolitan Planning Commission shall be finally acted upon by the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| within 120 days following the public hearing provided for in Paragraph B of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| this Section 6, which, in fact, is the hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| the public hearing before the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| And failure of the council finally to act upon any proposal within said 120-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| period shall be in all respects equivalent to rejection thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=478)|
| 0:08:04| All three of these items were items that were initiated by application with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=484)|
| 0:08:10| Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| The Metropolitan Planning Commission public hearing on these matters was held on May the 9th of 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=492)|
| 0:08:20| 120 days from then would be September the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| Since we are past September 6th, as I read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=503)|
| 0:08:26| it would provide that it shall in all respects be the equivalent of a rejection of each of those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=506)|
| 0:08:34| I can understand that there might be a difference of opinion as to whether this applies to not only the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=514)|
| 0:08:41| itself but also the sector plan and the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| But in my view, in reading the wording that's there, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| I think it applies to all three because all three are amendments that were initiated by an application with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=532)|
| 0:08:59| So that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| And the council, Mr. Seymour had signed up to speak on this item, so we'll hear him now as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| Mayor, members of council, I agree on the zoning part, which is 12F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=548)|
| 0:09:16| I agree the time has expired, and that should be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| 12D and E deal with separate ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| The section Mr. Swanson referred to deals with the ordinance, and it is part of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=563)|
| 0:09:34| But D and E deal with the general plan and the one-year plan, which are not part of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=574)|
| 0:09:42| They are adopted as the one-year plan is adopted as a separate ordinance by this body upon recommendation of the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=582)|
| 0:09:55| Likewise, the general plan is readopted every year in a separate ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=595)|
| 0:10:02| I would request, I have talked to Mr. Klein, who represents certain neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=602)|
| 0:10:08| and he and I have agreed that 12F is moot, but 12D and E would be postponed for two weeks for further discussion on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=608)|
| 0:10:20| I have discussed the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| I have not with Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| I discussed it with Mr. Frost today and Mr. Donaldson on whether or not the time period has expired on the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=624)|
| 0:10:36| and the general plan, and I think we were in agreement that since they were not part of the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=636)|
| 0:10:43| they were not, had not been rejected by the lapse of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=643)|
| 0:10:57| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| Certainly, I respect Mr. Seymour's opinion and have for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| He's a great lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| If I represented his client, my argument would probably be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| I have to say, though, that as I read this part of the code, it's referring to the zoning ordinance here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=665)|
| 0:11:13| All of this comes out of Appendix A, which is the zoning ordinance to the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| and it says, Section 6, the regulations, restrictions, boundaries, and options set forth in this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=678)|
| 0:11:25| may, upon proper application by the property owner or his designated representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=685)|
| 0:11:31| or by an appropriate governmental agency or the city council, be amended, supplemented, revised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| or repealed from time to time as conditions warrant as hereinafter set forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| And to me, that's such broad language that I believe that the sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=701)|
| 0:11:46| and the one-year plans are all part of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| And it says everything in this ordinance that you try to amend by an application filed with the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=710)|
| 0:11:57| has this 120-day limit on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| So I respectfully disagree with Mr. Seymour's opinion with regard to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=719)|
| 0:12:05| and it's my opinion that it is applicable to all three of those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=725)|
| 0:12:12| May I respectfully disagree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| Because Article 1, Section 2 refers to the ordinance, and it defines what the ordinance is, which is the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=734)|
| 0:12:23| And the one-year plan and the general plan or sector plan, as we have discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| are adopted by separate ordinances separate and apart from the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| And Article 7, Section 6, simply refers to this ordinance, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=754)|
| 0:12:41| I don't have it in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| I have it over here in my notebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| I guess we could do did to did not all night, but I'll just withdraw at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| I'd like to hear from Council's legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| Thank you, Councilman Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| Mr. Seymour accurately represented our we had a conversation this morning of about 30 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| and we got MPC Executive Director Mark Donaldson on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| To be honest, my first impression was in agreement with what Mr. Swanson said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| I mean, if you look at the form itself, it actually says plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=792)|
| 0:13:17| And we got Mr. Donaldson on the phone, who walked through the steps as he saw that they fit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=797)|
| 0:13:23| that Mr. Donaldson did not think that the 120-day limitation was going to apply to this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=803)|
| 0:13:34| To be honest, Mr. Donaldson is the Executive Director of MPC, so I did defer to his knowledge of the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=814)|
| 0:13:42| I confess my initial impression matched that of the City Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=822)|
| 0:13:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| Call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| We have a light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| Let me call on Councilman Del Valle, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| I just want to ask either of these Councils up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| there's no requirement that we act on less than all of the provisions that is a sector plan, a one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=837)|
| 0:14:05| and a zoning ordinance, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| We are free to act or not act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| With regard to the motion withdrawal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| Or with regard to the substance of the debate that you two had over is it barred or is it not barred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=851)|
| 0:14:17| It would be Mr. Seymour's opinion that you are free to do whatever you want to do with regard to the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=857)|
| 0:14:25| and the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| It sounds like he would agree that essentially the zoning plan is moot at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=867)|
| 0:14:32| It's my opinion that all three are moot at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| But as a practical matter, regardless of the legalities, we are free to adopt or not adopt any request before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=876)|
| 0:14:43| even if it's recommended or not by MPC once we've heard the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| If I understand what you're saying, you could adopt the motion to withdraw all three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=889)|
| 0:14:56| regardless of whether Mr. Seymour is right or whether I'm right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| If I'm right, you couldn't go ahead and act and amend the sector plan and the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=900)|
| 0:15:08| You could not do that if I'm right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| Because it would have passed out of the time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| Because it's passed the time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| And, Mr. Donaldson, a withdrawal is the same effect as a denial, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| Here's the bottom line for me, which this is my district that I represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| And I don't quite understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| I do understand that we're going to have another piece of property that's going to adjoin this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| and that you're going to come back to us with both pieces of property together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| I just personally have a problem going ahead and changing the sector plan and the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=939)|
| 0:15:44| until we get the zoning to where it needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| and also be able to make sure that the neighborhoods surrounding that area understand what's going on also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=947)|
| 0:15:54| So my preference would be that we do it all at one time and that we let this die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=954)|
| 0:16:00| If I may respond, the adjoining property, which belongs to Mike Chase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=960)|
| 0:16:06| will be before you all in two weeks on the regular progression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| MPC heard the sector plan, the one-year plan, and the zoning on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=971)|
| 0:16:18| and it will be up next week or, excuse me, your next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=978)|
| 0:16:24| That has been the reason for the delay on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| because the proposal is to combine the two properties and do a project that involves both properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=987)|
| 0:16:37| Mr. Kline requested, who represents the neighborhood, initially called me, I think last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=997)|
| 0:16:46| and requested that this matter be postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| And I said, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| In a discussion today, I advised him that the time had run out on the zoning, so it should be withdrawn or denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1011)|
| 0:17:01| But the sector plan and the one-year plan should be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| Now, the property cannot be rezoned as requested by the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1026)|
| 0:17:12| unless the sector plan and the one-year plan are amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1032)|
| 0:17:18| because at the present time they call for low-density residential, which is five units or under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1038)|
| 0:17:24| We are looking at a combined condominium development for this property between the Smith property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1044)|
| 0:17:31| and the Chase property, which will be up in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| And it would be best if we could hear the sector plan and the one-year plan both on both properties at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1055)|
| 0:17:44| in two weeks, or at a time that Mr. Kline and counsel and I find best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1064)|
| 0:17:54| I think part of the problem, too, is that I know my colleagues don't really know what's going on between the two pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1074)|
| 0:18:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| And it just seems to me that you folks ought to just start all over and come to us with a complete package so that we have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1081)|
| 0:18:07| And I was not aware until just before counsel in terms of about the, you know, the withdrawal of all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1087)|
| 0:18:14| I know about the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| But I think that, you know, my recommendation for the district and for the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| and everyone to really see what's going on is for them to be able to see a total plan with the two parcels of property together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1100)|
| 0:18:28| And we are going to be having a neighborhood meeting in the very near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| We intend to show that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| There are preliminary plans that have been developed to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| We intend, Mr. Kline and I are going to have a meeting sometime to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| And I'll be happy to go ahead and send the preliminary plans to everybody for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| Well, what's the problem with waiting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| Well, the problem is we cannot go back to MPC on the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| because of the ordinance that adopts the one-year plan until January of 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1134)|
| 0:19:06| And it cannot come back to city council until February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1146)|
| 0:19:12| And I don't think anybody has requested that Mr. Kline has requested that the sector plan on behalf of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1152)|
| 0:19:20| that the sector plan or the one-year plan be voted down tonight or withdrawn tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1160)|
| 0:19:27| His request to me was postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| And I said, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| I understand the zoning is gone and it will have to be filed at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| But the zoning and the sector plan and one-year plan do not have to be heard at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1176)|
| 0:19:43| You can file for a sector plan and a one-year plan amendment without filing an accompanying zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1183)|
| 0:19:50| That's done quite frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| Councilman Wallace, I see your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| Did you want to speak as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| You lost me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| So I guess I'll go back to Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| And, Mr. Kline, it looks like you want to speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| So, Mr. Wallace, do you want to go ahead first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| Yeah, go ahead and we'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| Mr. Kline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| Very briefly, Wayne Kline here for the neighborhood, for the Dean Hill Neighborhood Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| And I was not aware of all of the issues that have come to light tonight when I spoke with Mr. Seymour today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1215)|
| 0:20:24| I'm here basically on the Chase property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| That's why I was hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| So I don't want you to be confused that somehow I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| I think Councilman Grieve's opinions should carry the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| Mr. Swanson, I'm glad you're with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1236)|
| 0:20:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| And also, Councilman Mark Donaldson, did you want to add something to this as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| We have to keep in mind that our administrative rules with respect to bringing back applications that have been denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1246)|
| 0:20:56| is to not take an application for a similar zone or one-year plan amendment for a period of one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1256)|
| 0:21:04| So the effect of denying the one-year plan would, in fact, take medium-density residential off the table as an application for 12 months from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1264)|
| 0:21:22| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Well, I guess that's what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| Is that the way you see it, Charles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| Are you saying they're already off the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| You're saying they're already off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| The way I read the code, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| shall in all respects equivalent to rejection thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| I'm not sure that can be waived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| So it's off anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| It's off anyway for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| That's what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| A year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| In my opinion, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| Eight until May 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| Or to what date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| To the day they first applied or the date it expired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| I would defer to Mr. Donaldson to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| That's an MPC administrative rule, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| Yeah, that is our administrative rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| And I would expect that it would be the 121st day that the new year would start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1329)|
| 0:22:17| But, again, we're only talking about the Smith property would be off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| The Chase property could still go since it hasn't come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| It comes up in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| And the intention is to combine the Smith and the Chase property for a ultimate condo or apartment development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1348)|
| 0:22:39| So if you're going to ---- I would like to talk to this further with Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1359)|
| 0:22:48| And I would request, respectfully, that the 12D and E be postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1368)|
| 0:22:57| But we can't postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| Councilman Dallavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| Yeah, I think I'd like to call the question and see if we can get this resolved at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| It seems to me that if they're going to combine properties and do anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| they're going to be in a separate application and the one-year plan is not going to run into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| So I think we should call the question and move on to the heart of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| So without objection, we have a motion now to withdraw 12E and F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| I'm sorry, 12D, E, and F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| And we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| So that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| So we will move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| 5B, items for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1420)|
| 0:23:47| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| And I don't know if this needs a motion or not, but 9A is listed to be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| It does need a motion, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| I will move to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| Or how long do you want that to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| Just for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| It's just a councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| I mean, Vice Mayor Pavlis could not be here and he wanted to be here for that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| Two weeks then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| That is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| Are there any items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| What is yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| Another postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| And I think there are a couple of people who would like to speak to it, but it's 12G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1464)|
| 0:24:30| 12G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| That is the rezoning on Westland and Morrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1474)|
| 0:24:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| Good evening, Mayor, council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| I'm John Britton, 620 Market Street here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| I'm here this evening on behalf of my partner, John King, who has recently been retained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1489)|
| 0:24:56| to represent the Homeowners Association there in Westmoreland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| Mr. King was hired last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| He contacted Mr. Seymour and asked that this matter be postponed for a couple of weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1503)|
| 0:25:09| because he has to be out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| And so we're here this evening asking for the postponement because Mr. King's absence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| he won't be back in town until, I think, Thursday of this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| Sir, did you also want to speak to it or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| Madam Mayor, council, Jim B. Miller, 7219 Lawford Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| I spoke to several of you on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| I met with Mr. King two weeks ago tomorrow, and he agreed to look into this for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| but he told me he was going to be out of town and was going to request a reset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| And I spoke to several of you last Friday, and because of him being out of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| and wondering if he was going to have that reset done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| I spoke to several of you as if we were going to go ahead and hear this matter tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| So I apologize for that confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| But he had talked to Mr. Seymour in the meantime, and they'd agreed to the reset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| Councilman Grieve, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| Mr. King called me last week and advised he was going to be out of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| asked if this could be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| I said, I have no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| Would you like that for 120 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| I think you requested two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| Two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| Is there any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| So we have a motion and a second to postpone 12G for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| Oh, is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| I thought I had a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| Motion and a second to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| I'm trying to figure out why we need to postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| I think there has been some discussion about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| Personally, I'm ready to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| I don't know if my colleagues agree with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| I'm trying to figure out what's going to be accomplished by postponing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| I want their counsel here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| I just think it was a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| And, you know, they've got two more weeks to try to work something out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| And I think we've got a history here of giving people all the time, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| to bring something back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| And both parties asked for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| I think we ought to be granted to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| I agree with Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| I'm not really sure why we're postponing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| This has been postponed more than once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| There's a lot of confusion about what kind of a plan is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| One plan is for assisted living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| One plan is for three residences per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| Another group wants one house per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| And another group just wants to leave it wooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| So I'm not really sure what will be gained by a two-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| Well, I have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| Are you going to abstain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| I'm going to abstain on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| Now that I see some colleagues are against, you know, this is a contingent issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| So unless somebody withdraws that, then we will vote on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| and see whether there's support to postpone it or not or to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| Clarification, postponement for two weeks is what we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| Two weeks, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| The neighborhood wants it postponed for what reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| I mean, they made it perfectly clear that in terms of what you folks wanted with the 17 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| So what, as Mr. Saunders says, what's going to be gained by two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| Councilman, I believe that our position is that we didn't oppose the original plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1712)|
| 0:28:39| for residential, and at this point, there has not been a new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| It's been reset once at the request of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| And at this point, we don't have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| So I don't know how we can oppose a zoning or ask for a zoning if we don't really have a plan to go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1732)|
| 0:28:58| So that's why we wanted to go ahead and hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| We were trying to marshal the neighborhood so we could get our petition in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| and get the neighborhood here, and we had to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| It takes a few days to do that, so that's why we were talking about this on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| And it's just almost professional courtesy on our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| Mr. King had talked to Mr. Seymour before we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| They had talked and agreed to the request, and so that's part of our reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| Well, let me make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| It was my understanding when we've been discussing this that, and maybe Mr. Donaldson can comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1769)|
| 0:29:35| that that property has been rezoned for X number of lots, correct, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1775)|
| 0:29:42| And that was done in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| The property is currently zoned R1 and has been for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| R1 would allow development of a subdivision at a density of about four units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1793)|
| 0:30:00| The Planning Commission's recommendation was to do a planned zoned district at no more than three units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1800)|
| 0:30:07| That planned residential district also allows as a permitted use assisted living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1807)|
| 0:30:14| Okay, but what was approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| What went before MPC and was approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| MPC made a recommendation on this zoning in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| July, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| And the neighborhood was not aware of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| No, previous to that, there was a plan that was approved that I thought was 17 residential homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1831)|
| 0:30:37| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| And part of this is when the applicants represented by council, and we're not, we're at a severe disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1838)|
| 0:30:46| It's that old adage, a person that tries to represent themselves has a goal for a client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| So that's why we thought because of the intricacies of this, it would be important for us to retain Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1852)|
| 0:31:01| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| Okay, so we have a motion and a second to postpone 12G for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1863)|
| 0:31:09| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| Reluctantly, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| Reluctantly, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| And with one abstention, that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| We'll see you in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1881)|
| 0:31:26| Okay, we're down to consent items, 11G through 11O, the pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1886)|
| 0:31:33| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| The pensions are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| Now we're on the mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| First, I want to welcome, we have Troop 451, Boy Scouts, Troop 451 from here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1905)|
| 0:31:53| We appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| Would you like to stand so we can see you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| Thanks for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| Also, I understand we have some journalism students from UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| Where are you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| Oh, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| They make up the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| We have a big crowd tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| Well, actually, I should tell you that it's 30 minutes into the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| and we're just now starting at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| Usually all of the preliminaries, the items to withdraw and postpone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| usually don't take 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| But thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| Okay, so a few more announcements that I have to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| I know you all are familiar with Mighty Musical Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| which is held at the Tennessee Theater typically on the first Monday of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| Well, this Monday, November 4th at 12 noon, that will occur again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| And this time our special events office will be there to announce the lineup of events for Christmas in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1968)|
| 0:32:55| our winter festival with lighted trees and the decorations and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| So we invite everybody to come out and to find out what's in store for the holiday season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1979)|
| 0:33:05| and also to see a live performance of A White Christmas in Knoxville by Theater Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1985)|
| 0:33:11| So I hope we'll see you there on Monday at 12 noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| Of course, early voting is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| We want to remind everybody there is an election going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| And to vote, this early voting ends this Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| I'm sure a few of the council members can tell you exactly what times you can go vote between now and Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2006)|
| 0:33:32| You can also go to KnoxVotes.org, which is the Knox County Election Commission site for locations and times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2012)|
| 0:33:39| And, of course, next Tuesday, November 5th, is Election Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| And on Wednesday, November 6th at 6 p.m., we will hold a public meeting to present plans for the new South Knoxville Waterfront Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2024)|
| 0:33:55| the Sutry Landing Park, and the new local street called Waterfront Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| And this event on Wednesday the 6th at 6 p.m. will be at South Knoxville Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| And we invite people to come out and see the plans as they are now and to provide your input and comments on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2046)|
| 0:34:16| Also, three weeks from tonight, so we'll meet before this, but I want to go ahead and get this on people's calendars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2056)|
| 0:34:22| the city of Knoxville is holding a downtown summit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| I know council has asked some good questions lately about our downtown plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| and so we are inviting all of council and the community to come to talk about the big picture of downtown Knoxville redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2068)|
| 0:34:36| to look at what's happened over the past decade, what is happening now, and some of our opportunities and challenges for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2076)|
| 0:34:43| That meeting will be held Tuesday, November 19th, three weeks from tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| from 530 to 730 at the East Tennessee History Center, downtown Knoxville on Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2088)|
| 0:34:54| So we encourage everyone to come out for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| And that is the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2103)|

| 0:35:08| We did have a financial workshop today that was well attended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2108)|

| 0:35:42| and I think they've had the last public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| but I believe that David Massey, who's in the back, has put some of that information on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| We want to encourage everyone to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2150)|

| 0:35:58| and they are trying to formulate a plan as to how we're going to go forward after the first of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| and I urge people to be involved and get their voice heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2163)|

| 0:38:35| Councilman Delavope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| I see that Jim Hagerman is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| I know this is proposed by MPC and Mark Donaldson's group, but as we eliminate these turn radiuses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2320)|
| 0:38:47| on corners, are we going to have a problem with, you know, traffic rolling over curbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2327)|
| 0:38:53| or are there going to be issues you foresee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| I get this idea they're trying to move the streetscape closer to the road and have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2335)|
| 0:39:01| uniform front, but do you foresee any problems with cutting out the turn radius?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| This is not a place where you're likely to see a lot of trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| So it's the longer vehicles you're concerned about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| It does have a, yeah, for turn radii.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| And this particular intersection does have a signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| It will have a signal under the new Cumberland plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| That's one of the reasons I would recommend this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| And we will have one of the conditions it's subject to is sight distance, so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2377)|
| 0:39:47| So that there's ample clearance for making the turn before you actually approach it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| And you can see anything coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| My question was really posed because I was afraid that we would eliminate the turn radius,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| and then five years from now we'd be buying it back and trying to, I don't know, cut the corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| of the building off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| But you don't see that as an issue coming before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| I don't see that as happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2407)|

| 0:40:51| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| Let me ask one question to Mark Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| Mark, I guess we're getting into sort of implementing the ideas of the Cumberland Avenue District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| You refer to a street wall and this image of what we're seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| What exactly are we talking about so that we're all using the same lingo as we get into this sort of Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2466)|
| 0:41:13| corridor development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| One of the fundamentals of the plan was to pay attention to the street as a public space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2476)|
| 0:41:27| And as we created the Forum District, we decided to move away from the pattern of a minimum setback to a required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2487)|
| 0:41:39| building line with the thought that the building facades help to frame that public space that we share with everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2499)|
| 0:41:52| called the streetscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| So all the buildings sort of align and you have this uniform look, is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| Yes, there's a required building line and then there's a requirement that a certain percentage of every building has to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2519)|
| 0:42:05| built to that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| So through the combination of building frontages and street landscaping, you create a framework for this public space that we share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2527)|
| 0:42:19| Okay, so it's an aesthetic constraint, so to speak, to pull it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| Yeah, I would say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2547)|

| 0:43:01| Come forward to explain about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| Can we set the timer for the up to five minutes each for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| Hi, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| I appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| My name is Amy Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| I live at 5015 West Summit Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| I am currently the president of the Forest Heights Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| As many of you may recall, Councilmember Grieve proposed a resolution early last March to rezone Forest Heights neighborhood from its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2604)|
| 0:43:33| current R1 zone to the more exclusive R1E zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| This action was requested by our neighborhood association in response to a house that was being remodeled to be a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2618)|
| 0:43:49| However, after the resolution was passed, about ten neighbors came out in strong opposition to this rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2629)|
| 0:43:56| The reason was not because they supported duplexes in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| It was because they currently had a home occupation and would lose their right to file a use on review in order to protect their livelihood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2640)|
| 0:44:10| They did not have the typical home occupation that you might think of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| They did not see clients in their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| They did not have employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| They did not have a sign in their front yard or increased traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| They basically had a home office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2661)|
| 0:44:28| They simply worked from their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| Having a home office is currently included under MPC's definition of home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2670)|
| 0:44:38| And having a home occupation is not allowed in the R1E zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| In June, we tabled MPC's vote to rezone the neighborhood in hopes that a compromise could be reached and that we could have the support of the entire neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2683)|
| 0:44:52| After speaking with Councilman Grieve, MPC Director Mark Donaldson, and his staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| the compromise was agreed on that we would create a new definition of the zoning ordinance, a home office definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2697)|
| 0:45:04| This new definition would be amended to the R1 or the R1E zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| While MPC will be responsible for establishing the criteria for this new definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| we hope that the definition will be restrictive enough that as a neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| you would have no idea that anyone in your neighborhood would have this type of home office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2718)|
| 0:45:25| We have spoken with the Westwood and West Hills communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| who are the only two neighborhoods within the city that have the R1E zoning designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| They both support the creation of this definition and amending it to the R1E zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2734)|
| 0:45:41| Our plan is to untable the MPC's vote to rezone our neighborhood once the new definition is amended to the R1E zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2741)|
| 0:45:51| We feel that there are currently hundreds of residents across Knoxville illegally operating a home office in their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2751)|
| 0:45:58| This resolution is just the first step in support of these neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| Thank you for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| Do you have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| They'll call on you after when it's time for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| So stick by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| Yes, sir, are you speaking as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| I'm John Ulmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| I live at 4124 Jamandua Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| I would only add one thing to what Amy has said, and that is this is a case where technology has moved beyond the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2781)|
| 0:46:29| When the zoning ordinance was adopted in the early 60s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| the home office definition has not been amended since that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2793)|
| 0:46:37| At that time, we didn't have fax machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| We didn't have computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| We did have telephones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| But now it's common for people to work at home, to have an actual job working for somebody else while working at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2803)|
| 0:46:52| So in this case, I believe that technology has moved beyond the law and it's time to make a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| So we have a motion and a second to pass 11A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| No, we don't have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| We do not have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2830)|
| 0:47:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| The other zones that are not named in this, are home offices allowed in those zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| Are they excluded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| Are they falling under the, you know, I'm a little bit confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| I need some help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2846)|
| 0:47:27| Mark Donaldson is the one who needs to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| The R1E zone district is unique amongst the residential zones in that it doesn't address home occupations at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2853)|
| 0:47:42| All of the other zone districts allow home occupations as a use permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2862)|
| 0:47:49| That particular use was stripped from the permitted uses for the R1E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| So there is a pathway for people within other zone districts to get a home office as well as a home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2874)|
| 0:48:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| If I live in another district that has home occupations allowed and I want to have a home office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2883)|
| 0:48:08| what do I have to do and how do I know that I have to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| You have to get approval by the Planning Commission as a use permitted on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2893)|
| 0:48:20| and you probably would know that only if there was a complaint against you filed by someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| and the Permits and Inspections Department followed up on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| So this is another one of our famous complaint-driven ordinances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2911)|
| 0:48:37| It is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| I said one of several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| Yeah, I suspect from Councilwoman Palmer's comments, we ought to be thinking, as you look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2923)|
| 0:48:50| at any broader definition that includes some of the concepts the young lady, Amy, mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| which are for a home office use that involves using phones, computers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2935)|
| 0:49:02| and pieces of paper and a light on your desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| I can't imagine anyone going for a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2945)|
| 0:49:08| That's different than the list of home occupations like doctor, lawyer, beauty parlor, and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2948)|
| 0:49:14| where you attract customers into the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| But it seems to me that the casual use of your house for any purpose that's not grossly unlawful ought to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2957)|
| 0:49:23| left up to the homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| So the definition ought to look at that maybe being broader as it goes across the zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2965)|
| 0:49:32| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| I want to add that I got an e-mail from Dr. Pelo, who's the immediate past president of the West Hills Community Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2974)|
| 0:49:42| and he wanted us to know that they also support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| Did you get this e-mail in your home office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| I got it in my home office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| Okay, so any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| I have some concerns about this, and one of the concerns, in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| this council and other councils have made requests from MPC to explore something, come back with something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3006)|
| 0:50:14| and then it didn't look like our vision at the time we made that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3014)|
| 0:50:20| And I would just like to say that I do not want to see that happen again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| because that is a lot of time and efforts expended by MPC with community events and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3025)|
| 0:50:31| So I really hope that when something comes back, if this passes this body tonight, that we don't decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3031)|
| 0:50:38| well, we don't like the way that looks, and, you know, we do one of our U-turns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3038)|
| 0:50:46| Councilman Grave, are you responding or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| I'm sort of responding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| But I do want to say that working with both these individuals and their neighborhood association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3050)|
| 0:50:56| they've done a lot of work in not only reaching out to the other zones that are comparable to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3056)|
| 0:51:02| but they've also worked with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| And I think that they have a fairly clear definition of what they're looking for, and I think MPC understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3064)|
| 0:51:11| So I think this is going to be a little bit different than some of the things in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| So I hope that that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| So call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| 11B is a resolution expressing appreciation to Pilot Corporation for the donation of a 165-square-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3086)|

| 0:51:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3107)|

| 0:52:06| I'm sorry, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3126)|
| 0:52:07| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| I think, if I'm not mistaken, this is a minority business that is receiving this once it's approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3128)|
| 0:52:14| and we've been working on trying to help some of our minority businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| so I'm glad to see this hopefully be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| Yes, tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3142)|

| 0:52:28| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3149)|
| 0:52:30| 11D is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a development agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| with the Walnut Street Garage, LLC, for the transfer of certain real property owned by the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| located at the intersection of Summer Place and Locust Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| as consideration for the construction of a multi-story parking garage on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| and which agreement, which incorporates the relevant obligations of a memorandum of understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3166)|
| 0:52:51| between the city and TVA, will result in the termination of the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3171)|
| 0:52:57| Councilman Dalibopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| Christy, I want to thank you for all your hard work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| It's obvious that a lot of thought went into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| I do have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| I know we're all excited about that garage being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| I thought there was some provision in there that after 15 years the lease would expire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3192)|
| 0:53:18| unless maybe TVA opted for another five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| What happens if at the end of 15 years it's not leased in terms of the right of public use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3202)|
| 0:53:28| Is that going to be treated differently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| On nights and weekends the public would use this garage free of charge as part of our effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3210)|
| 0:53:36| to encourage folks to go downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| Christy Branscom, Chief Operating Officer, Deputy to the Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| The lease agreement now is between TVA and the private developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| But the covenant that provides free parking to citizens on the weekends and the evenings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3226)|
| 0:53:52| will run with the property regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| So we're protected regardless of what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| We're protected regardless of any leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| That's all I need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| I was just curious in the proposal or the package that we got, we only got half the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| And I would just like to see the other half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| You only got half the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| Walnut Street Garage LLC, their representatives are here this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| and they brought the plans with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| I was hoping we were going to build the whole building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| Do you want to see the better half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| We'll ask Mr. Petrie if he plans on building the whole building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| Joe, is this going to be half at a time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| Joe Petrie, I'm at the Langley Building, 520 West Summit Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| And, yes, we intend to build the whole building and nothing but the whole building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3276)|
| 0:54:41| So help me God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| You do have drawings we can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| We do have drawings, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3284)|
| 0:54:45| Whatever you'd like to see, we're prepared to show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| I was curious as to where all the retail space is going to be because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| we only have half in our package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| It must be on the other half, but there is retail proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| The retail, the lot widens as it goes toward Locust from Walnut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| and so the retail is proposed actually on Summer Place but close to the corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3305)|
| 0:55:10| so we get to take advantage of the traffic coming off of West Summit Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3310)|
| 0:55:14| And then we've got another position along Locust that will also be commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3314)|
| 0:55:20| It's deemed commercial and the whole thing is deemed commercial slash retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| I guess no one else was worried about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| No, I saw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| Did you see it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| Do you have more questions, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3333)|
| 0:55:34| No, I'm through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3335)|
| 0:55:36| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3336)|
| 0:55:37| I just wanted to move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3340)|
| 0:55:41| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3343)|
| 0:55:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3345)|
| 0:55:46| Thanks for bringing your plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| I do want to see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| 11E is a resolution authorizing the Industrial Development Board of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| to negotiate and accept from Knoxville Locomotive Works, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| payments in lieu of ad valorem taxes with respect to real and personal property located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| or to be located at 300 West Quincy Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| and finding that such payments are deemed to be in furtherance of the public purposes of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| as defined in Tennessee Code Annotated Section 7-53-305.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| Mr. Wetzel, you're here, eager to tell us a little bit about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| I understand this is for four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| and I'm trying to get my arms around it a little bit in terms of what actual taxes will be paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3386)|
| 0:56:32| that will hit our coffers as opposed to launch over to pay for some of the cost of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3392)|
| 0:56:39| Because this is a pilot, what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| we will be phrasing the taxes where they currently are on both the real property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| and there will be a $50 a year increase on the personal property that's coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| So we're not going to get a lot during the short term except for possibly 50 to 100 new jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3410)|
| 0:56:56| But the base level taxes still come into the coffers and help pay the bills of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| It's the additional money that helps fund this, in essence, job creation opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3422)|
| 0:57:07| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3429)|
| 0:57:10| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3434)|
| 0:57:15| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| That is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into a contract with O-Wind Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3437)|
| 0:57:20| DBA Ice Rink Events to lease ice making and ice skating equipment, services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3440)|
| 0:57:25| and supplies to the city of Knoxville for an amount not to exceed $67,854.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3445)|
| 0:57:32| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| Is Judith here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| Judith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| I just want to say this has probably been one of the most exciting events that occur on Market Square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| ever since it started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3464)|
| 0:57:45| And I thought maybe you might be able to tell us a little bit about how many people we've had in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3465)|
| 0:57:50| and what the future looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| And is this the same cost as it was for last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| It's actually a little bit less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| We are entering into another three-year contract with this company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| And finance has managed to, I believe, bring the cost down a little bit, probably about $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3481)|
| 0:58:11| What were our numbers last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| Because I know when I was down there in the evening, a lot of people were using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| There was a lot of excitement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| I mean, it generates an awful lot of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| How many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| Actually, I have some graphs that I could show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| We have the advantage of doing waivers for anyone that is actually skating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3503)|
| 0:58:30| so we can kind of keep up with the head count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| Plus, we have the staff counting spectators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| So it's running, we're close to about 19,000 skaters in the two-month period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3517)|
| 0:58:44| as well as close to probably 8,000 to 10,000 spectators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3524)|
| 0:58:52| So we were down a little bit last year due to the weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3532)|
| 0:58:58| We hit almost 20,000 two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| We are predicting to hopefully get it back up to almost 20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| We'd love to break the 20,000-person skater mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| Is there still opportunity for sponsors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3555)|
| 0:59:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3556)|
| 0:59:17| I just want to make sure people know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3557)|
| 0:59:18| Are you volunteering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3558)|
| 0:59:19| Put him down for no pun intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| We did the very first year, but then, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3563)|
| 0:59:24| We've got Home Federal has stepped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| They've been our sponsor for a year now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| They've come back this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| and we've gone into agreement with them for about two to three consecutive years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3573)|
| 0:59:40| So we've got them as our presenting sponsor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| as well as CBID agreed last night to assist us again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3584)|
| 0:59:50| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| So are you leading council on the skate team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3594)|
| 0:59:55| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| I will, as long as you're my assistant, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3597)|

| 1:00:01| Three hockey stars, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| How about Charles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| Charles, will you go with me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| Okay, Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3605)|
| 1:00:06| Roller skate maybe, but not ice skate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| And if you all want to know, Cool Sports is doing three lessons, 12 to 2, on Sundays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3608)|
| 1:00:15| The mayor and I will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| I'll need the lessons if I'm going to try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| I haven't ice skated since high school, and that was only a couple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| But the key is if we go downtown and drink hot chocolate and watch the others fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3622)|
| 1:00:26| we're still helping the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3627)|
| 1:00:28| Then you'll get a lot of laughs, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3633)|

| 1:00:35| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3635)|
| 1:00:36| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| Thank you, Judith, and thank you to Home Federal and the other sponsors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| 12A is an ordinance to amend the operating budget for fiscal year 2013-2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3641)|
| 1:00:47| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3647)|

| 1:00:49| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| And I would like to ask Mr. York to come up and kind of walk us through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| because I know we're getting into part of a fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| Mr. York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| Please identify yourself for the visitors here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3663)|
| 1:01:08| Jim York, finance director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| This is a companion piece to Item 11D, the one that you just passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3671)|
| 1:01:17| related to Walnut Street Garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| What you have before you is a budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| With the transfer of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| we will need to expense the city's investment in the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| and in any improvements to the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| And that's what this budget ordinance does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| The funding is coming out of the metro parking fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3700)|
| 1:01:45| The estimated investment in this piece of property is about $3.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3705)|
| 1:01:54| Councilman Della Vothe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| As long as he's up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3715)|
| 1:01:56| Jim, this includes not only that acquisition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| but the demolition and getting it shovel-ready so we can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| here, developer, start building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| This includes the land acquisition, any improvements to property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| which would include demolition, grading, anything that we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3729)|
| 1:02:14| Any improvements is what threw me off, it seems like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| Well, again, that's more of an accounting terminology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3740)|
| 1:02:21| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3741)|
| 1:02:22| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3743)|
| 1:02:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| 12B is an ordinance to amend Chapter 4, Article 2, Division 2, Section 4-78c| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| of the Knoxville City Code relative to due dates of remedial plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| and fines for underage beer sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| I move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3761)|
| 1:02:42| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| This is an ordinance that just tidies up some of the confusion that exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| between the date that you pay your fine and the date that you submit your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| remedial plan, and so it aligns them all to be in a five-day window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3772)|
| 1:02:57| And while I have the microphone, on November 21st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| the Beer Board will be holding a workshop to explore a number of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| that come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3785)|
| 1:03:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3786)|
| 1:03:07| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3787)|
| 1:03:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3788)|
| 1:03:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3789)|
| 1:03:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3790)|
| 1:03:11| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| 12C is an emergency ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Chapter 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| Article 1, Section 6-5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| to establish the Cumberland Avenue Corridor District as being within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3797)|
| 1:03:21| First Fire District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| Councilman Dalivanti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3805)|
| 1:03:26| Yeah, I guess we've got the chief here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| Just tell me, if something is not put over into the First Fire District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3808)|
| 1:03:34| which I think is a technical amendment here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| we would have some kind of a gap in terms of enforcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| What's the consequence of not doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| Actually, I think we're going to call on Ann Wallace to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| It has to do with the foreign-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| Good evening, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3828)|
| 1:03:49| He has several trucks and I won't claim any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| Ann Wallace with the Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| I just wanted to let you all know the reason we're doing this is because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| C-7 District was currently within the Fire District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| and with changing the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| if we didn't enact this emergency ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| it would no longer be in the Fire District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| And that certainly has regulations and impacts on building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| and response times and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| So we wanted to make sure that we kept our Cumberland Avenue safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| and well covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| This is basically technical housekeeping, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| That's what it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| You need this as an enforcement tool, is that basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| Yes, that is a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| And this was reviewed by our inspection bureau, and they're good with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3871)|
| 1:04:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3873)|
| 1:04:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3874)|
| 1:04:35| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3877)|
| 1:04:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3879)|
| 1:04:40| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3882)|
| 1:04:43| I'm going to call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3883)|
| 1:04:44| Okay, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| Council, I got kind of caught up in all these legal opinions at the start of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3886)|
| 1:04:49| the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| I forgot to mention something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| If somebody wants to make a motion to reconsider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| there's one of the pensions on here that you all might want to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3895)|
| 1:04:59| Actually, there are two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3899)|
| 1:05:05| I think if you don't pass that, maybe the other two on there that you might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| want to reconsider, and then maybe those people could not possibly retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| That would be 11N and 11O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| And I have to tell you that at the board, at the pension meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| we had some debate on whether or not to approve these two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| I just want you to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3923)|
| 1:05:24| And we did so on the record reluctantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| so we might all want to go on this record going reluctantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| I'll make a motion that we reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| I'll make a motion that we reluctantly approve those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| You can add reluctant to the consent items, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| Chief, do you have a cell downstairs we could put these people in to keep them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| The sheriff does all housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| Okay, so we don't have anybody signed up for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| so there being no further business, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| Thank you all for coming here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131029?start=3961)|
