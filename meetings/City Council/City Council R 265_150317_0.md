| 0:02:14| The mayor's report. First, come on down, Miles. We have a representative from Boy Scouts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=134)|
| 0:02:22| Troop 20 and why don't you tell us more about your troop and why you're here. And tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=142)|
| 0:02:27| your name first. Okay. I'm Miles Ryu. I'm Miles Ryu from Troop 20 in First Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=147)|
| 0:02:35| Presbyterian Church and I'm the senior patrol leader which kind of means I head the boys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| and I head the meetings like Ms. Mayer does. And yeah, I tell them all the announcements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=160)|
| 0:02:48| tell them what they're doing every day and I'm here because I have to get a requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| for citizenship in the community and you have to come to a public meeting so that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=173)|
| 0:03:02| I'm here today. Good. Well, thank you so much for being here. Who did you bring with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| My dad. All right. Thank you. We're really happy that you picked this public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| to attend. Thank you. And I hope you have as much cooperation from your troop as I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| from council here. And stay tuned. We'll see him up here very soon. I know. You're very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| good as a public speaker, I might add. Oh, thank you. All right. And now, so happy St.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=202)|
| 0:03:29| Patrick's Day to everybody. In keeping with the spirit of the day, I want to give a nod| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=209)|
| 0:03:34| to one of my predecessors in this seat, James Park, who was the second mayor of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=214)|
| 0:03:41| He emigrated here from County Donegal, Ireland in 1798. His house, of course, is still standing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=221)|
| 0:03:49| just a few blocks away on the corner of Cumberland and Walnut, the Park House. And so even if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| you don't have any heritage to claim yourself, you can still celebrate the city's Irish roots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=234)|
| 0:04:00| And thanks to Jesse Mayshark for that little bit of historical information. Excellent job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=240)|
| 0:04:06| Jesse. And some good news. Today was, this is really, really good news. Today was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=246)|
| 0:04:12| deadline for bids on the Cumberland Avenue Corridor Project. And I'm very happy to report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| that we had two competitive bidders. Great. Yay. We can all clap for that. You all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=257)|
| 0:04:23| that we had earlier efforts that did not give us bids we could use. So it's great to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| the response that we did today. Well, we do have an apparent low bidder, but that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=267)|
| 0:04:32| now be reviewed by our engineering department to make sure everything is accounted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| We do plan to bring you a contract for approval at your next meeting, so in two weeks, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=276)|
| 0:04:42| we can get this underway. Not a moment too soon. So thanks, really, a big, big shout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=282)|
| 0:04:49| out to Ann Wallace and to Bob Wetzel and our Office of Redevelopment for all of their work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=289)|
| 0:04:54| on this and for sticking with it and working to make sure that we had a project that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=294)|
| 0:04:59| work this time. And engineering. Pardon me? Oh, and engineering, yes. Thanks to engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=299)|
| 0:05:04| as well. Thank you. We do appreciate you. Okay, so there will be a public meeting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| talk about the construction schedule and the road and lane closure plans on Thursday, April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| 2nd at 5.30 p.m. at the University of Tennessee Visitor Center on the corner of Neyland Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=314)|
| 0:05:22| and Kingston Pike. We know this will be complicated and there will be some inconvenience and disruption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=322)|
| 0:05:29| during the construction. We can guarantee that. But this will make a huge difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| to the whole of Cumberland Avenue. And I know the Vice Mayor, this is your district, I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| you are extremely pleased with this as well. Some other events coming up to tell you about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| tomorrow, March 18th, is Transit Driver Appreciation Day. This is a chance to recognize and thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=343)|
| 0:05:50| the women and the men who drive our buses and keep our city moving. So I invite everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| to join me and our City Transit Director, Dawn Disler, tomorrow at 2 p.m. at the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=355)|
| 0:06:02| Station Transit Center, which is at 301 Church Avenue, for a short ceremony to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=362)|
| 0:06:08| some of our outstanding CAT operators. It's not an easy job and Dawn can tell you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| herself since she started out. I think she was a bus operator for about 10 years. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| this is going to be a nice opportunity to acknowledge their service. Another reminder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| on Monday, March 30th, we will have a public meeting to review the report that we recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=383)|
| 0:06:29| received from the Urban Land Institute Advisory Panel. And we will present some proposed next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| steps in addressing our major properties in and around downtown. So that meeting, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| is Monday, March 30th, at 5.30 p.m. at the East Tennessee History Center, 601 South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=399)|
| 0:06:50| Gay Street. In the meantime, that report is up on the City's website and we encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| everybody to go ahead and take a look at it and then respond with any comments or reactions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| you might have. There's an email address on the website where you can send your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=419)|
| 0:07:06| You'll probably remember that last fall we had a big announcement down at Volunteer Landing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| about a major cleanup effort on the Tennessee River that would be taking place this spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| So we're now just about three weeks away from that. The Tennessee River Tour, organized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| by the non-profit group called Living Lands and Waters, will kick off here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| on April 9th. This is a really excellent national organization that started with cleanup and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| education efforts on the Mississippi River and has spread out to work on waterways around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| the country. This is their first time on the Tennessee River and they'll be making stops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| at other cities in addition to Knoxville, including Chattanooga, Decatur, Alabama, Muscle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| Shoals, Paris, Tennessee, and Paducah, Kentucky. While they're here, they'll be partnering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| with Iams Nature Center on the annual River Rescue, which Iams does year after year. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=473)|
| 0:07:59| do a great job with it. And they will also have educational workshops for local high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| school students on their barge, which will be docked at Volunteer Landing. And they will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| be helping us plant about 2,500 trees all across Knoxville. So there are plenty of volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=489)|
| 0:08:16| opportunities for the River Rescue and other events, and you can learn more about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| We encourage people, if you want to volunteer, to either call Iams Nature Center or go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| the website, TennesseeRiverTour.org. And if any council members are interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=505)|
| 0:08:33| volunteering, I think Councilman Campin can help you. Since he's involved with this, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| was day job at Isaac Walton League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| Yeah, we used to do a little cleanup on the river. But I definitely do want to invite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=520)|
| 0:08:45| the rest of council to come out and participate in one of those days or two days or even an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| hour or two if you have a chance. Maybe we can coordinate a specific time and place to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| meet or location to do a cleanup. I think it'd show good support for the effort. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| since the river in Knoxville and beyond is a great economic engine for our region, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=539)|
| 0:09:05| I think showing support for this cleanup would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| Great. Another big event that's coming up for music lovers in town is the fourth Big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| Ears Festival, which kicks off on Friday, March 27th. And it goes for the weekend. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=554)|
| 0:09:21| once again, Ashley Capps is bringing an amazing array of performers and artists here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| That includes the Cronus Quartet that I pronounce it Cronus Quartet, Lori Anderson, Terry Riley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=566)|
| 0:09:33| and a whole host of other artists you may have never heard of, but you will love them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| when you hear them. That's what the last festival was like. I just walked into a show and was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| just blown away time after time by these wonderful musical acts, classical, rock, jazz, electronic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=581)|
| 0:09:48| and pretty much any genre you can name. Including, apparently, Inuit throat singing. I'll see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=588)|
| 0:09:56| you all there. So this is a great event to go to. Also a real big plus for Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| in terms of generating national and international attention. I mean, last time people came in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| from literally all over the world. We got a lot of great national and international| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| press on this. There's not another festival like it in America, so we're very fortunate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=610)|
| 0:10:16| I think, to have it here. And finally, just a big shout out again to the Office of Neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=616)|
| 0:10:23| the city and county, all of the staff and council who participate in the Office of Neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| I mean in the Neighborhood Conference on March 7th. 700 or so people, of which 100 were youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=628)|
| 0:10:35| So we had a huge youth contingent, some outstanding workshops, and thanks to everybody who participated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=635)|
| 0:10:40| everybody who came, and all of the sponsors too. Big, huge effort. At the same time we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=640)|
| 0:10:45| had 700 people at the convention center doing that. We had 500 dogs and all their family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=645)|
| 0:10:51| members dressed up and decked out at the parades. It was quite a Saturday in Knoxville. Thanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=651)|
| 0:10:57| for all of those, everybody who participated in that as well. That's the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| Any reports from council? Vice Mayor? Thank you, Madam Mayor. If you all remember, South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=662)|
| 0:11:08| Knox is still open for business. Well, Cumberland Avenue is coming back for business. So, version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=668)|
| 0:11:14| 2, I'm really used to these road closures, but I do look forward to that progressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| And I'd like to also remind folks that I'll have my quarterly Coffee with the Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| the 28th of this month, that's Saturday morning, at the World Famous Roundup restaurant. Sam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=686)|
| 0:11:33| sent me his, the owner, he got a 99 on his grading there the other day, and he was really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=693)|
| 0:11:39| proud of that. From the health department? So we'll give him a shout out to that. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| I'll be there at 9 o'clock until the last person is heard, so come on out for a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| breakfast, coffee, and some fellowship. Great. Councilman Grave. Thank you, Mayor. I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=707)|

| 0:11:58| cutting on Tuesday, their grand opening, and I'd like to encourage all my colleagues to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| be there, as well as to let the neighborhoods know. So that'll be Tuesday, and I think you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=723)|
| 0:12:09| be there, Mayor. Yes, yes, I'm going to be there as well. Thank you. All right, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=729)|

| 0:13:43| folks in Fountain City are excited about this. We've all heard from them about biking and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| walking in fear that maybe that I-640 Broadway exit was going to cut them off, and this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=829)|
| 0:13:56| a great project and effort to keep that connection and connectivity going between the north and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=836)|
| 0:14:04| south side of Broadway, so thank you for that. And this is the design phase. Right. Jim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=844)|
| 0:14:10| is there anything you'd want to add to that? I think the story here, at least for the residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=850)|
| 0:14:16| is this is something the state did not or could not put into its project, but we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=856)|
| 0:14:22| trying to sort of fill in the gaps so we don't have that break between the two sections of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=862)|
| 0:14:29| Broadway. Yeah, Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering, you've covered it pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=869)|
| 0:14:36| What's left? Well, we were excited about it. We heard from a lot of bicyclists who said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| you know, please don't leave us stranded. It is a pretty, it's a critical connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| for the non-motorized crowd because it's so far away to get through that ridge. You have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| to go a couple of miles in either direction in order to cross the ridge. There just are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| no other connections. I will say that there are folks in Fountain City that are still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| concerned about Greenway Drive and whether that leaves them stranded, so they have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| go north to go south in their motor vehicles, but I don't know what the answer to that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| I hope you're still looking at that. Thank you. We in T-DOT are still looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=910)|
| 0:15:16| Hey, Jim, I was wondering have communications gone well with the railroad and that underpass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=916)|
| 0:15:23| there? Do you have any news there? We haven't even started that discussion, I mean, except| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=923)|
| 0:15:30| the very early parts of that discussion. It can be, they can be a challenge, but we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=930)|
| 0:15:38| not affecting them very much directly. I mean, we're not, we're not going to reconfigure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=938)|
| 0:15:44| the bridge or anything. All right, thank you. All right, thank you. So we have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=949)|

| 0:16:48| opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered. 11D is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| to amend contract number C090058 with Vaughan and Melton Consulting Engineers, Inc. for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1012)|

| 0:17:05| for a new contract total of $1,091,818 and extending the date of completion. So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1025)|
| 0:17:13| Second. Councilman Dahlbeck. Yeah, I wonder, Jim, can you tell us, this is still more design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| work, do we have a total cost for this project yet or where are we? This one is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| more an adjustment for the fact that the amounts estimated to begin with were, the estimates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1043)|
| 0:17:31| were made seven years ago. While they did all that environmental work. Right, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1051)|
| 0:17:38| environmental work just lasted a whole lot longer than anybody expected and I mean it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| doesn't seem like a big environmental project, but under the umbrella of environmental is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1064)|
| 0:17:51| historical and there's all kinds of historical issues involved in this. I am a Civil War| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1071)|
| 0:17:58| veteran underground. I'm sorry? Did you find any Civil War veterans underground? No, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1078)|
| 0:18:04| too much under it, it's mostly the connection between the bridge and the adjacent buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| that were the big issue and the effect that we have on those adjacent buildings and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| the historic setting. So that's what caused it to drag out for so long and what caused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1093)|
| 0:18:20| the cost to go up. But we still don't have a price on the actual bridge itself or is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1100)|
| 0:18:26| that going to be done by the state or something? Part of the design process is to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1106)|
| 0:18:32| with an estimate. That is a question I cannot answer, but I can get back to you. Do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1112)|
| 0:18:38| know a number? The number is seven years old. Times two, right? Part of the design process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1118)|
| 0:18:50| is to come up with a good number and it is a state funded project, so we do have to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1130)|
| 0:18:58| up with a match of course. It's an 80-20? Correct. Thank you. Thank you. We have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1138)|
| 0:19:04| and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1144)|

| 0:21:20| Councilman Grieve. Thank you, Mayor. So you know we have one person signed up as well. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| That's fine. As you know, we've had a workshop on this and as you know, everyone's aware, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| spent over three years working on this and we're nearing the finish line, I'd like to say. And when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1290)|
| 0:21:38| we met at our workshop the other night, we looked at a couple of possibilities in terms of how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| council can be involved for the final readings and what we do in terms of sending this to MPC and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1303)|
| 0:21:50| final actions on this. What I'm passing out to you are two options in which council can look at to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| see what we might prefer in terms of how we want to finalize our ordinance in this situation. Option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1316)|
| 0:22:06| one that you see there on your sheet is, of course, tonight we have the option of what we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1326)|
| 0:22:12| do with the ordinance. I'm recommending that we refer the ordinance back to MPC. MPC has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1332)|
| 0:22:18| deadline of April 9th to receive that for their meeting on March 25th. I'm recommending that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1338)|
| 0:22:25| refer the ordinance back to MPC. I mean, we have until the deadline for April 9th is March 25th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1345)|
| 0:22:31| excuse me. Ordinance would then be considered on the April 9th MPC meeting. Fifteen days are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1351)|
| 0:22:37| required by MPC to come back to city council. We would then request a special called city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1357)|
| 0:22:44| meeting on Thursday, May 7th for the first reading and the ordinance before city council for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| second reading on June 9th. The second option is that, again, we have before us the ordinance. We can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1369)|
| 0:22:56| send the ordinance to MPC at a special meeting. MPC would hear at their May 14th meeting, would come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1376)|
| 0:23:04| back to city council. June 9th would be the earliest that city council would have it for the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| reading. And then on the second reading would be June 23rd on that. So there are two options there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1390)|
| 0:23:16| I'd like to ask for our legal counsel there to explain the differences between the two and why we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1396)|
| 0:23:25| talking about the difference of sending it to city council and the actions we have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| You did a pretty good job of talking about what the options were. That's kind of like a question from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1410)|
| 0:23:37| Mr. Dellavopa. You tell me what the answer is and then you ask me the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| I understand it. I'm not sure how to take that. I have to think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| It was entirely intended as a compliment, I can tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| Not to Mr. Dellavopa, but to me, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| And in a serious compliment, I do want to say that you guys have done great work with this. Mr. Wallace and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| Dwayne, you have shown great leadership with this ordinance. And you all have done just tremendous work in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| this area. And there are others involved who have done great work as well, including Krista Cuccaro in our office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| who I think has done a great job as well. But I think you're in a situation now where, as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1452)|
| 0:24:18| discussed at the workshop on Thursday afternoon, you're going to have to decide where you go from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1458)|
| 0:24:25| And in my mind, the easiest, most simple way to handle this is to take the product that you've put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1465)|
| 0:24:31| right now. You've all seen that in its revised version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1471)|
| 0:24:37| Take that product, make a motion tonight, and refer it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| Then it goes back to MPC for their review, and then it will come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| When it comes back to you, then you'll set it for a special called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| I think your special called meeting would be on May the 7th if you do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| We'll do it to the extent that needs to be done, line by line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| There will be some decisions to be made. There will be some issues that have to be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| You guys are ultimately going to be the ones who resolve those issues. You're really the only ones who can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1508)|
| 0:25:14| You can get recommendations from MPC, but you folks are the ones who are ultimately going to have to make the decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1514)|
| 0:25:20| with regard to the controversial matters that remain out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| There aren't that many of them, but there are some controversial matters out there that you all are going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| sort of go through issue by issue and ultimately come up with what your decision is going to be with regard to those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1530)|
| 0:25:37| You will be able to do that at that May 7th meeting, and then at the second meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1537)|
| 0:25:42| I don't know that it will be necessary to go through all that travail again unless you just feel like you need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1542)|
| 0:25:49| On the other hand, what you could do instead is schedule it prior to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| For a special call meeting, I think that would be April the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| You've picked out a date as a date that you could do it, and you consider it on a first reading on April the 9th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1560)|
| 0:26:07| and you go through the issue by issue thing on April the 9th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| and you make whatever call you want to make on those issues on April the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| Then, after you've done that, you send it back to MPC, and then MPC takes a look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| sends the recommendations back to you, and then you get it back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| It's going to be on first reading when it comes back to you again, because after looking again at the statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| I wasn't completely comfortable about this on Thursday night, but now I am, because I've looked at the statute again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1592)|
| 0:26:38| And what the statute really calls for is for you to have the benefit of the recommendations from MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1598)|
| 0:26:44| before you make a decision on these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| That you have those recommendations for your benefit on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| So when it comes back to you from MPC, you'll have it again on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| They may or may not make any recommendations for changes, but then at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| you'll be some time down the road at that point by the time it gets back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| And so at that point, you'll go through it probably issue by issue again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| and then have a second reading following that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| So to me, that is a little bit more of a cumbersome process to follow, but there's nothing wrong with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| There's nothing illegal about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| It's just that to me, it's a little bit of a more cumbersome and maybe a little more time consuming process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| But it's entirely up to council, and you can do it either way, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| within your legal rights and doing it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| Right, well, let me just say before questions come up that both ways, as you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| are acceptable and legal in terms of what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| The other thing I wanted my colleagues to know that all these dates that we looked at have been checked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| in terms of availability of rooms and this sort of thing on that and in terms of the time frame that are there on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| So questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| Let me call on the co-chair of the committee, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| I guess I'm going to go back to Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| So you think that even if we made our recommendations first, then sent it back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| that it would come back on first reading even if it didn't have any substantive changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| When it comes back from MPC, it needs to come back to you on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| After looking at the statute, I just don't see that the spirit of the statute can be complied with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| unless it comes back to you on first reading from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| Which gives us another chance to take more insight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| I guess I go back to on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| We debated it on Thursday, but I go back to Dan Kelly and ask him, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| what's your feeling that your commissioners and your staff are looking for from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1733)|
| 0:29:03| You made a suggestion the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| I guess I want to hear you say that or change that or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| Dan Kelly, MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| Given the action of the planning commission coming back to city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1752)|
| 0:29:18| I think what the planning commission was saying at that time is get the ordinance, city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1758)|
| 0:29:25| get the ordinance in the shape that you would like to see it before we deal with it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| Now, if any way you decide to act tonight is fine with us in that sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1771)|
| 0:29:38| but I think what the planning commission was saying was there are decisions that need to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1778)|
| 0:29:45| with regard to some of these items that are still left hanging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| and they would like to see as close as possible to the ordinance that council wants to adopt when it comes back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1788)|
| 0:29:57| And on that, that swayed my opinion the other night, and it sways my opinion tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1797)|
| 0:30:04| that it is, as Charles Swanson said, this is our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1804)|
| 0:30:10| This is our battle to fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| And I think that we've taken input from MPC on several occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| We've taken certainly a lot of public opinion about it and certainly worked on it as a task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| Now it's time to bear down, go section by section, and look at the wording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1823)|
| 0:30:29| and put it in a format that we're comfortable with before we send it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| I think it's prudent to send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| Also, with our recommendation, it's another set of eyes for them to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| It's another public forum, and it's another opportunity for the public to weigh in on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| and they'll get to weigh in on it when we vote on it, and they'll get to weigh in on it back at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| and then again on the first reading when it comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| So I think that's a really crucial part of the process, and hearing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| I think the best thing to do is to let's have the meeting, let's hash it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| let's get it the way and the shape that we want it, and then send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| So you're for option two on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| I'm for option two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| Okay, Councilman Delma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| Yeah, I'm going to rise in support of option two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| It strikes me that while two council members have been part of the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| and have labored in the vineyards for about two years or longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| having meetings, talking about it, that this council has really not acted on this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| other than the first reading back in 2012 or whenever it was, 2013, when we first looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1891)|
| 0:31:38| And as our council has said, you know, at the end of the day, we have to make the policy decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1898)|
| 0:31:46| the judgment calls that we think are going to be best for this community for the longer haul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| Now, a lot of hard work went into it, a lot of volunteer effort went into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| and somewhat of a compromise solution is before us, and it may be perfect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| but I think the other seven members of this body, as well as the two originals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| need to talk about it in public, to hear people from the public talk about what's wrong with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| what's right with it, what needs to be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| And let's get that done so that when we ask MPC to take another look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| and they've had probably four of them by now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| they have a target rather than let's just guess at what council's going to come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| And I think we need to give them, here's our idea, and ask professional planners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| tell us what we can do better or different if you think there's something wrong with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| I think that gets us the best final product at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| and I don't think it's about saving time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| There's been so much time invested already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| I think we're after a good product, and I think that's the way to go is option two, the special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1967)|
| 0:32:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| Yeah, I have a question about this idea of hashing it out at the meeting and going item for item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1977)|
| 0:33:03| Does that, I mean, unless we just come to some general consensus as a body on what's acceptable or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1983)|
| 0:33:10| is that going to involve, like, voting on each of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| and do we have a majority of council to approve that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| I don't see any other way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1998)|
| 0:33:19| I don't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| I just wanted to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| I'm going to make a motion that we go with option one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| and part of the reason, in all due respect to my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| we've had three, three, three and a half years of going over this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| and I really feel that there are only four or five key issues in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| that are really a concern both to neighborhood groups and also to the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| That doesn't mean that we shouldn't look at each one and decide that we're going to vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| but I think that all of us, if we really think about it, we know what the key issues are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| We know what the concerns of the neighborhoods are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| We know what the concerns of the chamber is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| and I think that even though George and I have spent over three years on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| I think most of my colleagues have been pretty well inundated with what the requests are from the different groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2045)|
| 0:34:12| I really think that what my understanding is, and Charles, correct me on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| is that ultimately we are the body that makes the decision in terms of what goes into this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| and what doesn't go into the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| That doesn't mean that by sending what we have, which is a framework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| which is what the task force has put together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| what the task force has presented to you, that that has been looked at by the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2073)|
| 0:34:39| it's been looked at by MPC, it's been looked at by the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| Now, basically what the task force has done is sent that to us as city council to take a look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2083)|
| 0:34:50| and to decide on whether or not those different pieces and parts of that ordinance are what you're going to agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| The task force understands that city council is the final say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| and so I think that we're at a point now where we already know that MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| we've had one and maybe two workshops with MPC over the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2105)|
| 0:35:11| They had an opportunity to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| It's my understanding that where the sign ordinance is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| that probably any of the changes or any of the recommendations they give us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| that we can go ahead and incorporate those into that meeting that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| Also, it's my understanding that most likely that we're not going to come up with any substance changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2128)|
| 0:35:35| hard word for me to say, but that, again, it's up to us as council to make that final decision on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2135)|
| 0:35:43| And so I want to move that we proceed, that we refer the ordinance back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| and that we follow option one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| That's a motion that I have on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| Yeah, I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| Okay, now before we vote on that, we do have somebody signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| Would you like to hear from her now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| I think sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| Does this mean that she has to speak on the motion, or does she want to wait until after we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| And then I do want to allow her to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| Well, she does need to speak to the motion, which is option one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| Can we suspend the rule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| I don't want to speak to the motion, so I'm happy to speak after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| Okay, we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| We'll make sure we don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| Yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| She's going to speak after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| Could we do a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| Actually, I had a question there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| Looking at option one, it calls for the specially called meeting on May 7th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2199)|
| 0:36:45| and then the second reading is not until June 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| Is there any reason the second reading wouldn't be at the May 26th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| Yes, because you have to have two full weeks between readings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| and you wouldn't have two full weeks because you're moving the May 7th first reading to a Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| so you wouldn't have two full weeks between Thursday and then the Tuesday following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2223)|
| 0:37:10| Well, I'm sure, and maybe I could be wrong, that there's a council meeting May 12th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2230)|
| 0:37:17| which would be five days later, and then May 26th, which would be 19 days later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2237)|
| 0:37:27| We're trying to avoid the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| Okay, so we're trying to avoid the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| Is that why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| That was part of the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| I have another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| I'd go back to Dan Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| I mean, is that guaranteed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| Is that path and that time frame guaranteed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| or could it possibly be hung up at MPC for further study or further input?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2264)|
| 0:37:54| Anything is possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| I don't know that I can, you know, once the matter gets in the public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| it can go any number of directions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| but I would anticipate if it comes back from council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| is basically stated this is our version of the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| Take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| Do you see anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| If you don't, make a recommendation and send it back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| Right, and, again, it's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| I think it's not just technicalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| I think there are some substantive changes that we want to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| and that we want to have votes on, and maybe it does vote out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| but we won't know until we vote on it, and we really have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| Back to Nick's point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| We haven't really been at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| We don't know, and I don't know where different people are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| Maybe sometimes Lacey says, I don't know where I am until I vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| If we send it to MPC, they can say, you know what, we're going to sit on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| We're going to study it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| We're going to go item by item, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| it can get lost in a circular file there without the direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| He's asking us to put it in the format that we're comfortable with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2340)|
| 0:39:06| and there are a lot of changes that could, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| or options that could be given that it may change it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| and I think one of those is an option that MPC first recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2352)|
| 0:39:18| were on sign heights were by road classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| That's not the way it's been presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| but it still could be presented to council in special session as an option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| and we can consider that, and that's definitely a substantive change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| and it's not the way it's presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| It's the way MPC originally recommended it to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| and it's something that we can talk about and vote on really for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| So, you know, not giving it back to them without that option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2382)|
| 0:39:50| sends back the message to MPC that this is a, here's the document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| and we're approving it, and we're sending it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| and I don't think that's the message that I want to send back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| that we're sending it back in a, it's generally in a format that I'm comfortable with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| but there's a lot of details in there that I'm not comfortable with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| and I don't think you want to send that message back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| Yeah, here it is, and we're approving it, and we're sending it back for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| and I think that's a big, I mean, can we get to the same place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| I think we can, but you're going to then, you potentially then undo what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2422)|
| 0:40:28| you send it back to MPC without any changes and any recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| They make recommendations, and we undo those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| Now where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| Now we're, you know, now we're really back to where we were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| and we're going to be hashing it all out again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| At least if we vote on it, and we come section by section to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| and we send that to MPC, we've agreed as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| MPC makes some recommendations that come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| then we can review it back and counter that back to whether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| what we just voted on and then decide maybe they had a better idea and maybe they didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| So it will, I think it's an opportunity to give us a much better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| clearer picture and a much simpler vote that we will have one hard time to vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| and then what comes back from MPC, then we can challenge that against what we sent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| So, and I think there's a lot more than just four issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2477)|
| 0:41:23| Maybe they're, Charles says they're not controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| I would challenge that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| I think these are very controversial issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| I said they were controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2491)|
| 0:41:32| Oh, they were controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| I thought it was weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| Whether it's a single word, a single word can make a controversy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| Yeah, that not word makes a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| So that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| That's what I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| I thought he said it wasn't controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| So I think that single words can make a big difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| and I think we want to send it back to MPC with the right message,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| and I really think option two is our best option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| Yes, I want to ask Mr. Kelly, in terms of MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| at some point in time it's going to have a new director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| Will that have any effect on the timeline of this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2526)|
| 0:42:13| You know, right now this matters before council for consideration what impact a new director would have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2533)|
| 0:42:21| not unless it's drawn out over a longer period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| I don't know that a new director would have any impact on this consideration of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2545)|
| 0:42:31| We hope not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| We hope we have a director in the near term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| but we hope we have a sign ordinance in the near term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2558)|
| 0:42:44| Well spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| Councilman Dela Robe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| Let me go at this a slightly different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| It seems to me that option one is, hey, touch the base so we can go out and play our ball game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2571)|
| 0:42:58| and it's just a technical referral, a shuttlecock shift to the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| The second one says, here's something we've hashed out now under the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| We're asking for your professional opinion as to how good or bad this product is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| and should something else be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| The second option gets you more meaningful professional advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| and I think that that's the smarter course to take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| since this sign ordinance is not going to be tackled for another 15 or 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| No one's going to want to get near it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| So we ought to do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| We ought to hash it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| We didn't have that opportunity at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2619)|
| 0:43:40| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| You've had that on for a while, so I wasn't sure if it was a new one or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| Comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| You know, I think council needs to look at itself and go back three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| and say what did we ask the task force to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| and what did we ask eight citizens and two council members to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| for the last three and a half years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| And that was to develop a sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| And they presented to you a sign ordinance that is, as I said the other night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| it's not perfect, but it's a good format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| In fact, we had a unanimous agreement on the organization of the sign task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2655)|
| 0:44:22| MPC has had several opportunities to weigh in on what they want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| or not say about the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| Mark Donaldson worked real hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| You saw in the red comments that he had made about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| The law department has looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| I think it's time for us to, from a procedural standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| go ahead and send it to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| If they have questions, which they've had quite a bit of time to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| We've had a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| There were very few questions asked at the workshop in terms of the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| And I think that two things need to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| Number one, we need to respect the work that the task force did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| and their recommendation that you have before you a sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| It doesn't mean that we didn't think that there would be changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| and that we didn't think that there would be items that would be discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| and discussed further, and that's why we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| or why we're going to have a special called meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| to where we as council can go over it word for word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| But I think it's time to go ahead and send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| I think Councilman Stair made some good points the other evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| about what he had to say about sending it to MPC or not sending it to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| So, again, I'm encouraging my colleagues to think about option one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2733)|
| 0:45:40| and let's move on with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| We're still going to all have the opportunity to discuss it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| take it apart, go word by word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| If we want to wordsmith it, so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| That will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| But I think we need to think about what has been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| in the recommendations that you have before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| So I'd like to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| Okay, so we'll just go ahead and have the roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| This is for option one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| Councilman Dela Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| Okay, that fails seven to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| So is there another motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| I would like to make a motion that we go with option two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| So in option two, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| is that we have a special call council meeting to actually weigh in on this thing, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| Yes, a special call council meeting on April 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| Then you send it to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| They hear it May 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| And then the first reading is June 9th back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| Second reading is June 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| Okay, Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| I'm supporting the second one that we're considering now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| Over the years I've observed that we send things to MPC with very vague,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| and I mean vague, expectations and instructions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| Then when they come back the way we didn't have them in mind, then we're all upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| We discuss it, cuss it, and send it back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| So it strikes me that with option two that we have an opportunity to kind of reverse that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2845)|
| 0:47:32| and make it very clear what we would like to see and let MPC weigh in and say yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2852)|
| 0:47:41| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| I think what I heard, Ms. Palmer, is that we're going to vote on these sections, correct, Mr. Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2863)|
| 0:47:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| Vote on these sections one by one, and then we will send a specific recommendation to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2872)|
| 0:47:59| and that will be the first reading, but because of the changes it will come back to us as first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2879)|
| 0:48:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| That won't be the first reading at the special polling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| When it comes back it will be on first reading because that's the first time you'll have the benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2887)|
| 0:48:12| of the recommendation from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| In fact, it will be our first reading, but it will come back because of the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| We'll have to start first reading again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| You'll do it on first reading, and you'll make whatever changes you want to make during that first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| and then there will be a motion to refer it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| No, that's not what you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| That's written down in shorthand, but that's the way it's got to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| The law director said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| Trust me on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| Okay, what did you say then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2919)|
| 0:48:40| Say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| Okay, what you're really asking for right now is a motion to postpone on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2921)|
| 0:48:48| until a special called meeting on April the 9th, and that's really all you're doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2928)|
| 0:48:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| And then later, you will consider it at that special called meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2936)|
| 0:49:03| and after you've changed it in whatever way you want to change it, go through it line by line at that April 9 meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2943)|
| 0:49:12| It will be on first reading at April 9 meeting, but whenever you've made all those changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| you then refer it to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| Those won't be straw votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| Those will actually be votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2961)|
| 0:49:22| Those will be actual votes, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| No, we still have two readings after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| You still have two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| Because we're sending it to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| He's just saying step one of the procedure is the only thing we can vote on really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| The rest of it happens later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| Right, but basically it's on first reading twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| All right, so the motion now is to postpone 12B to a special called meeting to be held April 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2981)|
| 0:49:52| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2993)|
| 0:49:54| Who made the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2994)|
| 0:49:55| Did I make the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| You did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| How's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| I wanted to get that in writing that I postponed once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| Would you like this to be the motion from Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| Listen, I'm chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| I'll go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| My colleagues have decided what's the proper way to go, and that's how we're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| I see some lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| Do you still want to talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| It's a tough issue, surprisingly, but the other night I thought the option one would be more streamlined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3023)|
| 0:50:30| and looking at these two, there was only a two-week difference, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| there seemed to be some strong feelings, and this basically does give us three meetings on the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3034)|
| 0:50:41| versus just two, so I thought that made sense, and that's why I went with option two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| What I said earlier still applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| I mean, there's no guarantee that you'll be back on June the 9th and the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| It may rattle around, and MPC is still yet some time, so that's all speculative, the 9th and the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3055)|
| 0:51:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| So really all we control is postponing it to April 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| So I do think for Mr. Kampen's benefit, I mean, we did, as you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3067)|
| 0:51:14| we talked about that we would take this section by section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| We'd go to section one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3077)|
| 0:51:18| We'd talk about it, any revisions to what we have in front of us is the way, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3078)|
| 0:51:24| we were talking about it anyway on last Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| We'd talk about it, and we would vote on it, up or down, and it's a real vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| I mean, it's a live vote, no straw, no, you know, and then move on to section two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3092)|
| 0:51:38| and, you know, through the deal until we can come up with the wording, and in various,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| some of it may just be a single word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| I mean, that's my intention, so I think this is a good move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| and I think it's a good move for all the citizens of Knoxville to have as much time here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| to present what their ideas and what they want it to look like, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3112)|
| 0:51:57| Okay, so Councilman Greene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3119)|
| 0:52:00| I'll call for a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| I'm fine with this, with option number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| Don't really have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| Do we need to, if we formally ask for a call meeting on the 9th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| do we still need to sign a document, have four council members sign on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| Or you can just have the mayor call it as the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| Now I'll let you guys sign, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| You don't want to get into this, do you, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3146)|
| 0:52:29| Okay, so let's go ahead and call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| Did you bring the paper for tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| No, but I'll prepare it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3154)|
| 0:52:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| Ms. Mitchell will prepare it for your signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| Whichever way, I'm glad to sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| Whatever way you want to do it, it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| I do have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| You know, normally our Thursday meetings start at 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| Is this one still going to be 530?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| Yes, 530 to whenever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| George?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| Have dinner before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| I can make it so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| Come prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| We'll have breakfast for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| We'll provide breakfast if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| Okay, so I think we can do a voice vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| All right, that passes unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| Now we do want to hear from Ms. Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| I was going to say we need to hear from Joyce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| And you know the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| I'll set the timer up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3206)|
| 0:53:27| I'll be a lot less than five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| My name is Joyce Feld, 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3210)|
| 0:53:37| And what I want to ask is that if you are able,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| I would like to ask City Council to officially disband the signed task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| I believe that, as you all know, I'm a member of the signed task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| and I believe that the task force completed its work as of January 14, 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3231)|
| 0:53:58| This is a sunshine committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| and so what it means is that the six citizens on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| who are probably the most intensely interested in this whole process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| cannot speak to Councilman Grieve or Councilman Wallace about any of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3250)|
| 0:54:20| I feel like it really puts me behind the eight ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| Councilman Grieve represents my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| Councilman Wallace is obviously an at-large counselor and represents me as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| as do the rest of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| But I can't talk to them about the signed ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| and I can't give them my input for this upcoming meeting, for instance, on April 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3274)|
| 0:54:42| So I would like City Council to officially disband the signed task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3282)|
| 0:54:48| I don't anticipate that it will ever need to meet again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| but I'm going to assume that if it ever does, it can be reconstituted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| Move to disband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| And to accept their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| Mercy Kelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| Okay, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| I was going to ask the law director, or someone, what is the process for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| Was this created by a resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| Yes, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3312)|
| 0:55:13| That's what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| It was created by a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| And it will have to be disbanded by a resolution that you'll need to put on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| And listen, I'm like Joyce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3320)|
| 0:55:21| God forbid that we have to reconvene, but just like what George was saying earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3321)|
| 0:55:26| we don't know what MPC is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| I certainly don't know what my colleagues are going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| And it is always possible for someone to say, well, gee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| why don't we have the signed task force look at it one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| And so my preference is not to resolve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| But I do think, Charles, it does have to be done by resolution, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| If it was created by resolution, you'll probably need to disband it by resolution as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| Okay, so that would be up to one of you deciding if you wanted to do it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3360)|
| 0:56:01| I think that Ms. Feld is one member of that task force, and there are other members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3361)|
| 0:56:07| and I think that they would all need to weigh in before we seriously considered dissolving this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3367)|
| 0:56:13| And as my colleagues have said, we would hope that they don't have to meet again, but one never knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3373)|
| 0:56:20| It's not a life sentence, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| I mean, they did their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3381)|
| 0:56:22| They're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| Yeah, but we didn't have Mr. Dellibopi in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| You did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| Okay, so that would have to be decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3390)|
| 0:56:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilmarch17?start=3395)|
