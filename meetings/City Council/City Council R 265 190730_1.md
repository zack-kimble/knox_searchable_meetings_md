| 2:39:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9580)|
| 2:39:41| So what is the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9581)|
| 2:39:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9582)|
| 2:39:45| Well, I've got to put it into the correct language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9585)|
| 2:39:48| Gerald, do you want to reiterate what you just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9588)|
| 2:39:52| The last sentence in C, that's 8.9C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9592)|
| 2:39:58| You see it now, any deviation from 8.9C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9598)|
| 2:40:03| the Planning Commission in reviewing the applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9603)|
| 2:40:06| could only deviate the land disturbance and the density standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9606)|
| 2:40:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9613)|
| 2:40:17| That would basically be clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9617)|
| 2:40:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9619)|
| 2:40:20| That's the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9620)|
| 2:40:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9621)|
| 2:40:22| You're adding C at the very end of the sentence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9622)|
| 2:40:27| You're adding C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9627)|
| 2:40:29| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9629)|
| 2:40:30| That's what you're adding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9630)|
| 2:40:33| Changing it from 9.9 to 9.9C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9633)|
| 2:40:36| 8.9 to 8.9C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9636)|
| 2:40:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9639)|
| 2:40:40| Y'all know everybody understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9640)|
| 2:40:43| Clears mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9643)|
| 2:40:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9644)|
| 2:40:48| Trying to prevent the mud from the hillside flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9648)|
| 2:40:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9652)|
| 2:40:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9653)|
| 2:40:54| So we're adding C, the letter C, the last article, 8.9.C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9654)|
| 2:40:59| on that last sentence under 8.9C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9659)|
| 2:41:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9665)|
| 2:41:06| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9666)|
| 2:41:08| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9668)|
| 2:41:12| Everybody fine with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9672)|
| 2:41:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9673)|
| 2:41:14| So we have a motion and a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9674)|
| 2:41:15| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9675)|
| 2:41:16| Everybody ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9676)|
| 2:41:17| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9677)|
| 2:41:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9678)|
| 2:41:19| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9679)|
| 2:41:20| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9680)|
| 2:41:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9681)|
| 2:41:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9682)|
| 2:41:23| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9683)|
| 2:41:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9684)|
| 2:41:25| I wanted to just make a comment or proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9685)|
| 2:41:27| I know I've slept since then, but I believe we deferred this to the stakeholder committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9687)|
| 2:41:31| The RN2 proposal was 7,000 first draft, 5,000 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9691)|
| 2:41:38| I just wanted to throw this out there that when this is taken up again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9698)|
| 2:41:42| I think that even 6,000 square foot minimum would be an improvement to deter slicing up lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9702)|
| 2:41:49| particularly in the, well, across the city, but in Lonsdale and parts of Oakwood Lake Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9709)|
| 2:41:54| It would deter taking two lots and making three out of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9714)|
| 2:41:59| And so, again, I believe that that was pushed back to the stakeholder committee, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9719)|
| 2:42:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9724)|
| 2:42:05| And we'll look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9725)|
| 2:42:07| I think the issue with making the RN2 6,000, if that were done now, would be a fairly substantial change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9727)|
| 2:42:14| I think also it would make a number of lots nonconforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9734)|
| 2:42:19| The 5,000 was selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9739)|
| 2:42:21| We had back some time ago in a council workshop numbers on the number of lots that were made conforming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9741)|
| 2:42:29| because of the 5,000 square foot minimum lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9749)|
| 2:42:33| The stakeholder committee will review and look at one of our topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9753)|
| 2:42:39| Priority task will be identifying if there is a need for an additional single family residential district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9759)|
| 2:42:45| with a lot size between 10,000 of RN1 and the 5,000 of RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9765)|
| 2:42:51| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9771)|
| 2:42:52| I do appreciate that reconsideration and future review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9772)|
| 2:42:56| Lastly, another question that came up today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9776)|
| 2:42:58| and I know money that has been spent and budgeted for the work done thus far was approved by council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9778)|
| 2:43:05| and I'm just curious going forward and implementation of RECODE in general, how much is it going to cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9785)|
| 2:43:14| You guys are spread thin in your office as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9794)|
| 2:43:16| Like, what do you foresee in the budget going forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9796)|
| 2:43:19| About the same as our current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9799)|
| 2:43:22| So no additional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9802)|
| 2:43:23| Well, before RECODE, in the short four years I've been here, we've had two substantial amendments to the existing zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9803)|
| 2:43:31| The parking ordinance was one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9811)|
| 2:43:34| The allowing residential in C3 and C6 was another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9814)|
| 2:43:39| We review it, work with Peter's office on a daily basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9819)|
| 2:43:43| so just be actually back to a more normal workload because there's a huge amount of staff time that's dedicated to RECODE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9823)|
| 2:43:51| We'll actually have time to do some other things, likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9831)|
| 2:43:55| So I don't see it as a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9835)|
| 2:43:57| We do what we're tasked to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9837)|
| 2:44:01| We have a very efficient staff, a very knowledgeable staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9841)|
| 2:44:04| and continue to work to improve the future of Knoxville and Knoxvilleans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9844)|
| 2:44:09| as well as Knox County because we're a joint planning department, so we work hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9849)|
| 2:44:16| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9856)|
| 2:44:17| The truth is he's going to miss all of these extra meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9857)|
| 2:44:21| We've gotten so attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9861)|
| 2:44:23| Well, the only salvation is that the triplets here will continue to work with the stakeholder committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9863)|
| 2:44:31| I say that somewhat in jest, but, again, I want to thank Peter and Christina for the hard work that they put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9871)|
| 2:44:41| and Amy Brooks from our staff, and a lot of these people here, some of them are here for the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9881)|
| 2:44:47| but a number of them have been with us throughout, members of the stakeholder committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9887)|
| 2:44:51| and ad hoc stakeholder committee members who show up at all the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9891)|
| 2:44:56| and the limited press presence that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9896)|
| 2:45:01| They're dedicated, but they've been with us for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9901)|
| 2:45:03| The dedicated press here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9903)|
| 2:45:05| Well, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9905)|
| 2:45:07| It was brought up today that it hadn't been really discussed and budgeted for the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9907)|
| 2:45:12| how much will all this implementation cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9912)|
| 2:45:14| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9914)|
| 2:45:15| We have been very aware of it, believe me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9915)|
| 2:45:17| Well, I appreciate that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9917)|
| 2:45:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9919)|
| 2:45:20| We implement the current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9920)|
| 2:45:21| We'll just have a new code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9921)|
| 2:45:23| And, honestly, I know the proposed code a whole lot better than I know the existing code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9923)|
| 2:45:29| For some of us, it will be easier to implement the new code than to monitor the current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9929)|
| 2:45:35| So thank you for taking staff word by word through this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9935)|
| 2:45:40| Okay, any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9940)|
| 2:45:41| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9941)|
| 2:45:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9942)|
| 2:45:43| I get the sense that there's a vote coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9943)|
| 2:45:46| So I just wanted to take a minute and thank you for bringing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9946)|
| 2:45:52| It has been, I know, a lot of long meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9952)|
| 2:45:55| and you have been leading us through a very transparent and open, detailed discussion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9955)|
| 2:46:03| And I just want to personally say thank you for, one, the opportunity to work on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9963)|
| 2:46:10| and, two, the way you've conducted our discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9970)|
| 2:46:14| So I just wanted to make sure I thanked you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9974)|
| 2:46:16| I also wanted to make sure I thanked because, I mean, I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9976)|
| 2:46:27| Gerald and I, I don't know if we go, like, more than two minutes without talking every once in a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9987)|
| 2:46:33| and Peter, too, and Christina and Director Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9993)|
| 2:46:39| The staff, all of you, really, a tremendous amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9999)|
| 2:46:44| So I wanted to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10004)|
| 2:46:46| The folks on the Stakeholders Committee, all the time that you put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10006)|
| 2:46:50| Would they stand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10010)|
| 2:46:51| Who else on the Stakeholders, if you're here, if you don't mind identifying yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10011)|
| 2:46:56| Stand on up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10016)|
| 2:46:58| I think they really need to get recognized for all that they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10018)|
| 2:47:08| Everyone who's participated in this process, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10028)|
| 2:47:11| I know there's been countless neighborhood meetings in all the districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10031)|
| 2:47:15| There's been countless meetings that the planning staff has done in the districts and have those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10035)|
| 2:47:24| The leadership in the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10044)|
| 2:47:26| This has been just an amazing process, a very thorough process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10046)|
| 2:47:32| And I can't not thank the members of Community Forum, as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10052)|
| 2:47:36| who have supplied us with a tremendous amount of materials and have been passionate advocates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10056)|
| 2:47:44| So, Larry and Carlene, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10064)|
| 2:47:48| So I just wanted to make sure we took that moment, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10068)|
| 2:47:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10071)|
| 2:47:52| Okay, so we've made more amendments tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10072)|
| 2:47:55| So we will, what I need now is a motion to, we have a motion, but it needs to be as amended, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10075)|
| 2:48:04| What is the new motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10084)|
| 2:48:06| The motion is to approve the text of RECODE as amended in tonight's amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10086)|
| 2:48:11| On first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10091)|
| 2:48:12| On first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10092)|
| 2:48:14| That's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10094)|
| 2:48:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10095)|
| 2:48:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10096)|
| 2:48:17| Was the motion made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10097)|
| 2:48:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10098)|
| 2:48:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10099)|
| 2:48:20| Ben Barr made the motion, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10100)|
| 2:48:22| He nodded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10102)|
| 2:48:23| We're voting on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10103)|
| 2:48:24| We're voting on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10104)|
| 2:48:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10105)|
| 2:48:26| And then after this vote, then we will take a break and then we'll come back and start talking about the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10106)|
| 2:48:29| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10109)|
| 2:48:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10110)|
| 2:48:32| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10112)|
| 2:48:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10113)|
| 2:48:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10114)|
| 2:48:35| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10115)|
| 2:48:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10116)|
| 2:48:37| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10117)|
| 2:48:38| So it passes eight to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10118)|
| 2:48:40| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10120)|
| 2:48:41| That's on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10121)|
| 2:48:42| We will bring that up again in two weeks at Council for second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10122)|
| 2:48:48| So let's take a brief break and then come back and let's start talking about the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10128)|
| 2:48:52| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10132)|
| 2:48:53| Welcome back, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10133)|
| 2:48:55| We are now going to move into the zoning map for RECO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10135)|
| 2:49:01| But before we do it, as we were thanking everybody, there's somebody that we forgot to thank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10141)|
| 2:49:07| And it's Jonathan Zarny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10147)|
| 2:49:09| And y'all, most of you can't see him, but we can see him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10149)|
| 2:49:12| He is the CTV person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10152)|
| 2:49:14| He's bowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10154)|
| 2:49:19| And he was fortunate enough to be delegated the work on Mondays and on Tuesdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10159)|
| 2:49:27| So he's been at several of our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10167)|
| 2:49:31| And so we want to thank Jonathan for his work and for CTV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10171)|
| 2:49:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10175)|
| 2:49:36| So if everybody has, we have proposed revisions, which was in the packet, to the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10176)|
| 2:49:44| And we have, did you all get your copy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10184)|
| 2:49:47| Do you have extra copies, Christina?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10187)|
| 2:49:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10189)|
| 2:49:50| Make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10190)|
| 2:49:51| If you don't already have it, it looks like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10191)|
| 2:49:57| The one, if you had it from two weeks ago, I think there's been one addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10197)|
| 2:50:03| So there should be 34 total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10203)|
| 2:50:06| The first 16 are from Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10206)|
| 2:50:09| And then the next ones are from planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10209)|
| 2:50:12| They're from my constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10212)|
| 2:50:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10214)|
| 2:50:15| They're from your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10215)|
| 2:50:16| Same with planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10216)|
| 2:50:17| They're from different requests that we'll go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10217)|
| 2:50:19| Do we have extra ones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10219)|
| 2:50:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10221)|
| 2:50:22| Who on Council needs the latest version of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10222)|
| 2:50:26| The one that's in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10226)|
| 2:50:28| I'll take a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10228)|
| 2:50:30| The one in the packet, did that have the number 34 in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10230)|
| 2:50:33| The one that went up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10233)|
| 2:50:35| 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10235)|
| 2:50:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10236)|
| 2:50:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10237)|
| 2:50:38| Then you'll need the new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10238)|
| 2:50:39| There was one more added, apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10239)|
| 2:50:40| Do you have enough copies for everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10240)|
| 2:50:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10245)|
| 2:50:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10246)|
| 2:50:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10247)|
| 2:50:48| Are there any more notes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10248)|
| 2:50:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10249)|
| 2:50:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10250)|
| 2:50:54| So as you all know, there were four drafts for the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10254)|
| 2:51:00| And after draft four, we stopped and said that any amendments would be done in our meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10260)|
| 2:51:08| just like draft five, the text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10268)|
| 2:51:12| So I propose that we move on, unless, Gerald, do you have any introductory comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10272)|
| 2:51:21| Just a few quick ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10281)|
| 2:51:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10283)|
| 2:51:24| And I brought up this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10284)|
| 2:51:25| These maps are charts which show the categorical changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10285)|
| 2:51:29| We tried to be, in terms of categories, zone neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10289)|
| 2:51:33| And these charts, which are on the recode website, show the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10293)|
| 2:51:39| This is an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10299)|
| 2:51:41| The agricultural zone had some fairly significant changes in that 15% of the acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10301)|
| 2:51:47| or almost 340 acres in agriculture, went to institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10307)|
| 2:51:52| That's because the UT hospital is zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10312)|
| 2:51:56| Bearden High School is zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10316)|
| 2:51:59| We had some really out-of-character, we have out-of-character zoning now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10319)|
| 2:52:03| And those resulted in categorical changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10323)|
| 2:52:06| This was the biggest one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10326)|
| 2:52:07| 97% of our residential districts are still residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10327)|
| 2:52:11| A few went to institutional because of schools and churches, large schools and churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10331)|
| 2:52:18| Knoxville College, for example, is zoned residential currently, and it changes to institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10338)|
| 2:52:24| But please look at these if you have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10344)|
| 2:52:26| Again, it's on the recode website if you have any questions about those broad categorical changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10346)|
| 2:52:31| And I want to affirm that in terms of broad categories, there's been little change that's not zone neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10351)|
| 2:52:39| And when there was change, it was for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10359)|
| 2:52:42| Now we'll go on to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10362)|
| 2:52:46| If you're ready for me, Mayor, I can start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10366)|
| 2:52:49| Yes, so let's so we're starting with the first 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10369)|
| 2:52:53| And what I was going to recommend is that Councilwoman Ryder and Gerald,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10373)|
| 2:52:57| however you want to do this, go through these first 16, explain what Draft 4 shows and then what the requested amendment is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10377)|
| 2:53:07| And according to our law director, we can, unless you all want to separate out any of these, we can vote all of them at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10387)|
| 2:53:17| So if we can go through 1 through 16, and then if there's no objection, we'll have a motion to approve them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10397)|
| 2:53:24| If you want to separate the question, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10404)|
| 2:53:27| Councilwoman, do you want to, how do you want to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10407)|
| 2:53:29| Do you want Gerald to go through them or do you want to start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10409)|
| 2:53:32| I can start and then I would like, I can start and I can go through them and be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10412)|
| 2:53:38| I don't want to bore you all to tears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10418)|
| 2:53:41| And Gerald, and then I want to have one clarification with you about 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10421)|
| 2:53:45| We had discussed an amendment to that, but when I read it here, I'm not sure an amendment to what's presented in this chart is actually needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10425)|
| 2:53:53| On the map it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10433)|
| 2:53:55| On the map it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10435)|
| 2:53:56| And we can make the change on the map based on the motion and the intent of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10436)|
| 2:54:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10443)|
| 2:54:05| Okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10445)|
| 2:54:07| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10447)|
| 2:54:09| Do we need to hear all those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10449)|
| 2:54:10| I mean, I'll make a motion we pass them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10450)|
| 2:54:14| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10454)|
| 2:54:15| I mean, we passed a lot more than that, so without knowing, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10455)|
| 2:54:21| To the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10461)|
| 2:54:22| Well, and just to the point, these are all ones that Councilwoman Ryder has discussed with constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10462)|
| 2:54:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10467)|
| 2:54:28| So maybe you don't have to do them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10468)|
| 2:54:30| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10470)|
| 2:54:31| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10471)|
| 2:54:32| That's fine if you want to go through them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10472)|
| 2:54:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10473)|
| 2:54:34| How about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10474)|
| 2:54:35| Do you want to, I can make a motion to pass item number 1 through 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10475)|
| 2:54:41| Fourteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10481)|
| 2:54:43| Because number 15 needs an amendment, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10483)|
| 2:54:46| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10486)|
| 2:54:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10487)|
| 2:54:48| So for my proposed revisions to the zoning map, number 1 through 14, I'd like to make a motion to pass those based on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10488)|
| 2:54:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10499)|
| 2:55:00| 1 through 14 and 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10500)|
| 2:55:03| My motion is to pass those based on the comments and the discussions with constituents and Director Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10503)|
| 2:55:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10510)|
| 2:55:11| Does anybody have any questions about any of these 1 through 14 and 16?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10511)|
| 2:55:16| You've had this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10516)|
| 2:55:17| The map is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10517)|
| 2:55:20| It looks like a lot of it is neutral zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10520)|
| 2:55:23| Neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10523)|
| 2:55:25| Are there any questions on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10525)|
| 2:55:27| Your light's on, but no one's home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10527)|
| 2:55:30| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10530)|
| 2:55:31| I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10531)|
| 2:55:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10532)|
| 2:55:33| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10533)|
| 2:55:34| It was just an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10534)|
| 2:55:35| Blame it on the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10535)|
| 2:55:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10537)|
| 2:55:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10538)|
| 2:55:39| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10539)|
| 2:55:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10541)|
| 2:55:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10542)|
| 2:55:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10543)|
| 2:55:44| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10544)|
| 2:55:45| So 1 through 14 and 16 are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10545)|
| 2:55:47| Now we're on number 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10547)|
| 2:55:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10549)|
| 2:55:50| Number 15, though it may look like it to you guys, I would like to amend what was on the revised map for conversations with constituents and Director Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10550)|
| 2:56:02| For the draft four zone map, was RN2 this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10562)|
| 2:56:07| It would be Sanders Crawford and Adair south of, did we say Connor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10567)|
| 2:56:11| Connor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10571)|
| 2:56:12| Connor would be RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10572)|
| 2:56:16| So not Renick, but Connor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10576)|
| 2:56:18| Connor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10578)|
| 2:56:19| So Sanders Crawford and Adair south of Connor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10579)|
| 2:56:22| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10582)|
| 2:56:23| If you look at the map where the cursor is, that's Connor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10583)|
| 2:56:28| So all this RN2, what we had tried to do was identify those lots that were close to the RN1 size and not make any nonconforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10588)|
| 2:56:39| This will create a few nonconforming lots due to size, but I think this is the desire of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10599)|
| 2:56:45| They would rather have a few nonconforming lots with regard to square footage than to have the potential for some redevelopment that would take lots and subdivide them further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10605)|
| 2:56:57| Again, all the areas south of Connor would be RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10617)|
| 2:57:05| The single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10625)|
| 2:57:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10626)|
| 2:57:09| Sorry, I don't want to confuse anybody and think that we're changing any of the multiplexes or apartments like the orange that's there behind the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10629)|
| 2:57:17| This is only the things that are designated RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10637)|
| 2:57:20| They would be RN1, and we have a meeting coming up with neighborhood reps and MPC staff to talk about any future changes or protections for that area due to a recent demolition in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10640)|
| 2:57:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10655)|
| 2:57:36| Is there a motion to pass that as amended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10656)|
| 2:57:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10659)|
| 2:57:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10660)|
| 2:57:41| Would you like to speak, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10661)|
| 2:57:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10662)|
| 2:57:44| Larry Deering, 200 Adair Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10664)|
| 2:57:47| First of all, I'd like to say that Ms. Malone reminds me of the person who succeeded Neville Chamberlain, a man who said, we will never surrender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10667)|
| 2:57:58| Just for my clarification, the proposal now is to include all of the single family residences from Connor all the way to Tazewell Pike, including Rose, Crawford, Lowe, Woodrow, and Coyle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10678)|
| 2:58:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10691)|
| 2:58:12| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10692)|
| 2:58:13| Yes, even though it does not say Rose in the chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10693)|
| 2:58:16| It's from Connor South, all the single family, the shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10696)|
| 2:58:21| All of those properties would be zoned RN1 with no RN2s in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10701)|
| 2:58:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10706)|
| 2:58:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10707)|
| 2:58:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10708)|
| 2:58:29| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10709)|
| 2:58:30| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10710)|
| 2:58:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10711)|
| 2:58:32| Any questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10712)|
| 2:58:34| We have a motion to approve number 15, Sanders, Crawford, and Adair South of Connor from RN2 on Draft 5 to RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10714)|
| 2:58:44| You ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10724)|
| 2:58:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10726)|
| 2:58:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10728)|
| 2:58:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10729)|
| 2:58:50| That passes 9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10730)|
| 2:58:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10732)|
| 2:58:53| We're now on 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10733)|
| 2:58:56| How would council like to proceed on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10736)|
| 2:59:00| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10740)|
| 2:59:02| Mr. Green, you want to give a brief overview, and if there are questions, we can go in deeper on any of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10742)|
| 2:59:08| There are a number of relatively minor changes based on comments with property owners, review of the maps to ensure compatibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10748)|
| 2:59:18| There's the addition of number 34 on Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10758)|
| 2:59:23| Some of it is the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10763)|
| 2:59:25| The CG2 that was originally proposed is a more pedestrian-oriented zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10765)|
| 2:59:32| It requires minimum setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10772)|
| 2:59:35| CG2 allows larger setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10775)|
| 2:59:37| And with the recent improvements to Alcoa Highway, when we looked at those, the CG2 did not work on that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10777)|
| 2:59:45| So CG1 is a zone-comparable zoning, which acknowledges the improvements to the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10785)|
| 2:59:53| There is one correction on item number 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10793)|
| 2:59:57| When you look at the comments, looking at the Draft 4 zone, it states IMU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10797)|
| 3:00:03| The requested zone is IG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10803)|
| 3:00:05| But in the comments, it says the sliver polygon should be IMU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10805)|
| 3:00:11| That should be changed to IG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10811)|
| 3:00:13| That was a typo, and I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10813)|
| 3:00:16| But it is correct under the requested zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10816)|
| 3:00:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10819)|
| 3:00:20| And I'd be happy to pull any of these up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10820)|
| 3:00:22| Again, they were based on compatibility with the area, minor changes, and requests by property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10822)|
| 3:00:33| Is that a legal term, sliver polygon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10833)|
| 3:00:37| For a GIS staff person, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10837)|
| 3:00:41| I guess it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10841)|
| 3:00:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10843)|
| 3:00:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10845)|
| 3:00:46| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10846)|
| 3:00:48| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10848)|
| 3:00:49| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10849)|
| 3:00:51| Gerald, these ones that we're looking at for planning, these are all from the owner contacting you and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10851)|
| 3:00:58| hey, I need to look at these being changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10858)|
| 3:01:00| Or are these developed by planning staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10860)|
| 3:01:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10864)|
| 3:01:07| Some of them were like the number 23 that we just referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10867)|
| 3:01:13| That was just a little sliver polygon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10873)|
| 3:01:16| Sorry, a small piece of property where on our old maps, the property line did not align with the zoning line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10876)|
| 3:01:27| And when we revised the maps as part of this, we realized that there was a portion of the property that had been unzoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10887)|
| 3:01:33| and so we're pushing the zoning to the edge of the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10893)|
| 3:01:37| And another one would be number 20, which staff recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10897)|
| 3:01:42| It was originally proposed as CG2, because in looking at it, the small parcel was C3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10902)|
| 3:01:49| but the CG2 purpose is to front on a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10909)|
| 3:01:54| That's a pedestrian-oriented zone, and the CG2 has a built-in zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10914)|
| 3:02:00| This is an interior parcel that does not abut a street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10920)|
| 3:02:03| so we're recommending CH2 that matches the larger parcel that it's surrounded by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10923)|
| 3:02:10| And they were either to ensure, based on conversations with property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10930)|
| 3:02:15| or to ensure compatibility between the physical characteristics of the lot and the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10935)|
| 3:02:24| I guess I appreciate what staff's doing here and what my colleagues are doing here, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10944)|
| 3:02:33| with trying to put together requests from constituents and make changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10953)|
| 3:02:42| I guess the struggle that I have had with the map is just having it be a zone-neutral map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10962)|
| 3:02:51| Definitely when somebody brings, hey, I'd like to change this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10971)|
| 3:02:55| which is what Councilperson Ryder had brought, that I have no issue with supporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10975)|
| 3:03:04| And most of the ones you're listing here from staff are owner-requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10984)|
| 3:03:14| That's my struggle is just deviating from a zone-neutral map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=10994)|
| 3:03:22| So I would suggest if we're going to vote on these in bulk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11002)|
| 3:03:25| why don't we separate them from the ones that were mentioned by the owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11005)|
| 3:03:29| and the ones that were staff-recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11009)|
| 3:03:33| And the only ones that were staff-recommended were number 19, I think, was owner-requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11013)|
| 3:03:43| It's a neutral zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11023)|
| 3:03:46| So that gets to your point of zone-neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11026)|
| 3:03:50| Number 20 I just mentioned, we can look at it, but I explained that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11030)|
| 3:03:55| Number 23 is a sliver polygon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11035)|
| 3:03:57| Number 25 is a typo in the existing zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11037)|
| 3:04:01| We had an issue with our existing zoning map where this was incorrectly identified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11041)|
| 3:04:06| so it led us to a certain designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11046)|
| 3:04:08| Then when we did the zone-neutral and corrected that typo in our existing map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11048)|
| 3:04:12| we realized that the IMU is the zone-neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11052)|
| 3:04:17| The other one is number 29, neutral zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11057)|
| 3:04:21| Again, that zone-neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11061)|
| 3:04:24| Number 30 is a sliver, just a little sliver near the city limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11064)|
| 3:04:29| where our old maps, the city limit, did not align with the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11069)|
| 3:04:35| When we revised and looked at an updated mapping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11075)|
| 3:04:38| we realized that without this change there would be a piece of property without a zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11078)|
| 3:04:43| And so that takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11083)|
| 3:04:44| And then number 34, I explained constraints due to the Alcoa Highway widening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11084)|
| 3:04:49| So I think that quickly goes over all the reasons staff is recommending changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11089)|
| 3:04:56| and there were only, I think, five that the recommendation comes from staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11096)|
| 3:05:01| Let me ask it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11101)|
| 3:05:03| So the ones that aren't brought to you by an owner and staff's making their recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11103)|
| 3:05:10| those are zoning-neutral?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11110)|
| 3:05:14| Either zoning-neutral or it's a sliver that would not be zoned otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11114)|
| 3:05:21| or it's the final one, number 34 is zone-neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11121)|
| 3:05:25| It goes from C3 now, it goes from CG2 to CG1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11125)|
| 3:05:29| which just means they don't have to have a bill-to-zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11129)|
| 3:05:32| They have a setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11132)|
| 3:05:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11135)|
| 3:05:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11136)|
| 3:05:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11138)|
| 3:05:39| So do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11139)|
| 3:05:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11143)|
| 3:05:44| We have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11144)|
| 3:05:45| 17-34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11145)|
| 3:05:47| We have a motion to approve 17-34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11147)|
| 3:05:49| Motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11149)|
| 3:05:51| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11151)|
| 3:05:53| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11153)|
| 3:05:57| Council Member Boda, did you want to separate it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11157)|
| 3:06:01| What I was getting from Gerald there was that the ones that aren't owner-requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11161)|
| 3:06:12| are zone-neutral, and if they're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11172)|
| 3:06:16| then it's a sliver that would otherwise be unzoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11176)|
| 3:06:21| Is that correct, Gerald?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11181)|
| 3:06:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11183)|
| 3:06:26| So given that we're going to have to do something with an unzoned place on the map, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11186)|
| 3:06:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11195)|
| 3:06:36| And then that these are mostly owner-requested and they are zone-neutral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11196)|
| 3:06:40| if they're not, then I feel like I can support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11200)|
| 3:06:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11204)|
| 3:06:45| Mr. Delvopi, did you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11205)|
| 3:06:47| Nick Delvopi, Crestwood Drive, Holson Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11207)|
| 3:06:49| I just thought from the discussion that there was going to be a motion to approve the five or six Gerald identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11209)|
| 3:06:56| as staff corrections that are zone-neutral or slivers or left out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11216)|
| 3:07:00| and that there might be some question as to the other changes that would be discussed separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11220)|
| 3:07:06| It might not be a very long discussion, but it seems like splitting it that way makes it clearer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11226)|
| 3:07:11| You're approving the ones that are just being fixed so they're zone-neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11231)|
| 3:07:16| And the others, I guess they may have the same result, but I don't think we really discussed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11236)|
| 3:07:20| so I would suggest you do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11240)|
| 3:07:22| Gerald, do you think you have, if we split it up that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11242)|
| 3:07:26| is there more to discuss about the slivers that you haven't already told us about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11246)|
| 3:07:31| Do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11251)|
| 3:07:35| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11255)|
| 3:07:36| Not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11256)|
| 3:07:37| They're either zone-neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11257)|
| 3:07:39| Sliver versus sliver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11259)|
| 3:07:41| Probably the most greatest change is on number 21, 824th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11261)|
| 3:07:51| This is zoned industrial now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11271)|
| 3:07:55| It doesn't allow the current use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11275)|
| 3:08:01| I think this is where Sassy Ann's are near.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11281)|
| 3:08:04| That's per owner request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11284)|
| 3:08:05| That's per owner request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11285)|
| 3:08:08| That's probably the biggest change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11288)|
| 3:08:10| We're going from industrial to commercial to allow them to use the building rather than tear it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11290)|
| 3:08:16| and put a metal building there like went in across the street, and that's the reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11296)|
| 3:08:22| All the rest, if their owner requests the zoning that they requested is zone-neutral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11302)|
| 3:08:30| and or matches the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11310)|
| 3:08:37| I'm okay with splitting them up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11317)|
| 3:08:38| but I don't know that we're going to get a lot more information than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11318)|
| 3:08:42| It's a sliver that's not otherwise in the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11322)|
| 3:08:45| and the recommendation from staff is to basically add that to the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11325)|
| 3:08:52| I'm not sure that violates trying to maintain some zone-neutral changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11332)|
| 3:08:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11339)|
| 3:09:00| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11340)|
| 3:09:01| My name is Christopher Sellmans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11341)|
| 3:09:02| I live at 1710 East 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11342)|
| 3:09:04| I just wanted to clarify because I had emailed Mr. Green a few days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11344)|
| 3:09:08| He told me that as a homeowner I didn't have the ability to make a change to the zoning overlays on the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11348)|
| 3:09:14| to conform to the property's current use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11354)|
| 3:09:17| and today we are talking about how homeowners have specifically asked for zoning to conform to what the property's current use is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11357)|
| 3:09:25| because in the case of my property, it's a single-family home that has been up-zoned to RN-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11365)|
| 3:09:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11372)|
| 3:09:33| We'll ask Mr. Green to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11373)|
| 3:09:34| As I told Ms. Sellmans in the email and copied all of you on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11374)|
| 3:09:38| that request came too late to get in the packet that came to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11378)|
| 3:09:41| and I've talked with Councilwoman McKenzie about this, have the list here to address later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11381)|
| 3:09:46| It was not that I told him he couldn't request the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11386)|
| 3:09:49| No, the email very specifically said that I had to have a council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11389)|
| 3:09:52| I said that it was too late to get it to the packet of staff recommending he would have to talk to a council member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11392)|
| 3:09:59| because we made a commitment that staff would not initiate a zoning change that you did not have advance knowledge of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11399)|
| 3:10:09| So, Mr. Sellmans, we can still address it, but let us do these first, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11409)|
| 3:10:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11413)|
| 3:10:14| And I have that information that I've shared with Gerald, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11414)|
| 3:10:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11416)|
| 3:10:17| So, we'll address that in a minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11417)|
| 3:10:18| And there is someone else, I think, here who will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11418)|
| 3:10:21| Yeah, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11421)|
| 3:10:22| Mr. Nix wants to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11422)|
| 3:10:24| Mr. Graham has some rezoning, so we'll get to all of those, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11424)|
| 3:10:28| We're just right now going through the ones that were posted two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11428)|
| 3:10:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11432)|
| 3:10:33| First, we're doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11433)|
| 3:10:34| Then we can go to – I've got Mr. Graham's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11434)|
| 3:10:38| I received that by email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11438)|
| 3:10:41| I don't know that I have Mr. Sellmans in front of me, but you have his, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11441)|
| 3:10:44| Or Councilwoman McKenzie and Mr. Nix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11444)|
| 3:10:49| Marlene's got one, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11449)|
| 3:10:50| Marlene, you have one, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11450)|
| 3:10:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11451)|
| 3:10:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11452)|
| 3:10:53| So, we'll just work through it, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11453)|
| 3:10:54| I apologize if Mr. Sellmans thought that he could have requested just the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11454)|
| 3:11:00| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11460)|
| 3:11:01| I've gotten so many emails and trying to respond to them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11461)|
| 3:11:03| Sometimes I know what I want to say, but you may not read my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11463)|
| 3:11:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11468)|
| 3:11:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11469)|
| 3:11:10| We will get to that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11470)|
| 3:11:11| So, now we are on 17 – I mean, yeah, 17 through 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11471)|
| 3:11:16| And what I'm hearing is there's not a need to divide these at this point, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11476)|
| 3:11:21| So, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11481)|
| 3:11:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11484)|
| 3:11:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11485)|
| 3:11:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11486)|
| 3:11:28| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11488)|
| 3:11:29| And it's unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11489)|
| 3:11:35| Nine to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11495)|
| 3:11:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11496)|
| 3:11:37| I have in front of me Mr. Graham's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11497)|
| 3:11:42| You all counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11502)|
| 3:11:43| I don't know if you saw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11503)|
| 3:11:44| It came by email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11504)|
| 3:11:46| And so – and Gerald did respond and have some conversations, I think, with Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11506)|
| 3:11:55| So, do you want to speak to it first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11515)|
| 3:11:57| Not to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11517)|
| 3:11:58| I just wanted to ask if we had any additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11518)|
| 3:12:01| Are we doing all the other people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11521)|
| 3:12:04| And then if Council has any additions, I have one more address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11524)|
| 3:12:07| So, I just wanted you to be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11527)|
| 3:12:09| So, somewhere in the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11529)|
| 3:12:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11530)|
| 3:12:11| Well, why don't we go ahead and do yours and get yours done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11531)|
| 3:12:13| Do I get my one done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11533)|
| 3:12:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11534)|
| 3:12:15| I'll still stick around, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11535)|
| 3:12:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11536)|
| 3:12:17| You all want to keep my vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11537)|
| 3:12:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11540)|
| 3:12:21| I didn't mean it like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11541)|
| 3:12:25| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11545)|
| 3:12:26| No more jokes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11546)|
| 3:12:27| No more jokes because they get taken the wrong way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11547)|
| 3:12:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11549)|
| 3:12:30| I don't mean that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11550)|
| 3:12:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11551)|
| 3:12:32| Now, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11552)|
| 3:12:33| Does Gerald know this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11553)|
| 3:12:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11554)|
| 3:12:35| It did not come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11555)|
| 3:12:36| It got sent to me by a constituent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11556)|
| 3:12:39| I'll wait here for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11559)|
| 3:12:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11561)|
| 3:12:42| That's so confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11562)|
| 3:12:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11563)|
| 3:12:44| So, we're going to do one more before you, Mr. Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11564)|
| 3:12:46| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11566)|
| 3:12:47| So, hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11567)|
| 3:12:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11568)|
| 3:12:49| Councilwoman Ryder has something that she hasn't had a chance to talk to you about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11569)|
| 3:12:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11573)|
| 3:12:54| Surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11574)|
| 3:12:55| Just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11575)|
| 3:12:56| It's not that exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11576)|
| 3:12:57| So, I'm looking at the amended maps, the same one that you're pulling up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11577)|
| 3:13:02| So, I get a little confused because I can't compare current to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11582)|
| 3:13:06| The corner of Forestall and McKamey is currently, it got zoned CN, but it's currently R2 and it's empty property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11586)|
| 3:13:17| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11597)|
| 3:13:23| And it's next to, it's contiguous with RN4 in both directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11603)|
| 3:13:30| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11610)|
| 3:13:33| Do you know the address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11613)|
| 3:13:34| Or I'll just look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11614)|
| 3:13:36| See, that's the problem with using this map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11616)|
| 3:13:39| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11619)|
| 3:13:40| It's zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11620)|
| 3:13:41| It's lot 23 McKamey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11621)|
| 3:13:42| It's next to 107 McKamey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11622)|
| 3:13:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11625)|
| 3:13:46| Let me try that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11626)|
| 3:13:47| Is that the one you had, Ms. Malone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11627)|
| 3:13:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11629)|
| 3:13:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11630)|
| 3:13:54| We have the address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11634)|
| 3:13:55| Well, you've got to use this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11635)|
| 3:13:58| That was in an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11638)|
| 3:14:03| If you look up 107 McKamey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11643)|
| 3:14:10| Oh, M-C-C-A-M-E-Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11650)|
| 3:14:14| It doesn't have a K in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11654)|
| 3:14:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11655)|
| 3:14:17| M-C-C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11657)|
| 3:14:19| It's M-C-C-A-M-E-Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11659)|
| 3:14:22| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11662)|
| 3:14:23| Yes, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11663)|
| 3:14:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11664)|
| 3:14:25| I know I misspelled it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11665)|
| 3:14:26| The computer is so smart that it corrects what I say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11666)|
| 3:14:28| Well, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11668)|
| 3:14:29| It's keeping us on our toes because it's late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11669)|
| 3:14:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11671)|
| 3:14:32| So, in the interest of having more residential and it's contiguous with residential on the right side or on the east side and across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11672)|
| 3:14:48| I just didn't understand why this commercial property or the question that came to me was why this was C-N versus R-N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11688)|
| 3:14:58| Because it's currently R-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11698)|
| 3:15:04| And maybe it seemed like a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11704)|
| 3:15:14| I'm sure there was some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11714)|
| 3:15:15| But, to be honest, I don't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11715)|
| 3:15:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11717)|
| 3:15:18| So, can I make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11718)|
| 3:15:19| I know there was a we got some comments from groups, including AIA and their design that we should find more locations for neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11719)|
| 3:15:29| And that may have been the driver trying to find locations near intersections that were vacant and may be appropriate for neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11729)|
| 3:15:39| But I don't really recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11739)|
| 3:15:40| And I'm comfortable with the revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11740)|
| 3:15:43| If we could make it R-N-4, which would be the equivalent of R-2, because that would be in keeping with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11743)|
| 3:15:53| It's medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11753)|
| 3:15:55| And the one you're calling is C-G-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11755)|
| 3:15:58| Since it's got residential all around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11758)|
| 3:16:01| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11761)|
| 3:16:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11762)|
| 3:16:03| I just got an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11763)|
| 3:16:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11764)|
| 3:16:05| Fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11765)|
| 3:16:07| And we just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11767)|
| 3:16:13| Part of it is C-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11773)|
| 3:16:32| So, can I ask Mr. Swanson a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11792)|
| 3:16:35| If we make amendments tonight and we pass them on first reading, and if we make any additional amendments next time, does that substantive change and we end up resetting our clock on that as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11795)|
| 3:16:46| Just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11806)|
| 3:16:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11807)|
| 3:16:48| Thank you for clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11808)|
| 3:16:55| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11815)|
| 3:16:56| But I do want to clarify, you know, even if the map is approved tonight, first reading, second reading, within the next couple of years, people can apply for free to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11816)|
| 3:17:09| It's not saying they're going to be granted it, but you can change zoning over the next two years for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11829)|
| 3:17:15| And that's the zone neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11835)|
| 3:17:18| I'll pick on Mr. Graham since he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11838)|
| 3:17:20| If he wants to go from office to, and it's currently zoned office, and he decides he wants to do industrial, heavy industrial, he'd have to pay for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11840)|
| 3:17:30| We depend on Mr. Graham for sustenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11850)|
| 3:17:34| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11854)|
| 3:17:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11859)|
| 3:17:40| Ms. Malone, do you want to speak to this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11860)|
| 3:17:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11861)|
| 3:17:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11862)|
| 3:17:43| I appreciate this being brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11863)|
| 3:17:47| This is presently R2 and zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11867)|
| 3:17:50| It is empty land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11870)|
| 3:17:52| Part of the lot, a small part of the lot, facing a different street, but the small portion of the lot is neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11872)|
| 3:18:02| The one-year plan, the sector plan, all say medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11882)|
| 3:18:06| And just hanging around here, I got the feeling that affordable housing was important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11886)|
| 3:18:12| You can see from that map, there are a lot of apartments around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11892)|
| 3:18:16| You can also see from that map, this is not on the main drag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11896)|
| 3:18:19| This is not on Tazewell Pike or Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11899)|
| 3:18:21| This is back into the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11901)|
| 3:18:23| We think it's a strong neighborhood with excellent schools, with strong churches, strong community resources of all kinds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11903)|
| 3:18:32| We think this is the area for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11912)|
| 3:18:35| Now, what's more important, and here's where we're setting priorities, what's more important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11915)|
| 3:18:40| Another trinket shop somewhere off the main drag or affordable housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11920)|
| 3:18:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11925)|
| 3:18:46| Because, you know, when we wring our hands and clutch our pearls, if we talk all day and all night about affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11926)|
| 3:18:52| and then do something like this in the name of tidy housekeeping or whatever, it makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11932)|
| 3:18:59| So, in other words, you're recommending that it goes to residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11939)|
| 3:19:02| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11942)|
| 3:19:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11943)|
| 3:19:04| Thank you, Ms. Mullen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11944)|
| 3:19:05| Let me just make one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11945)|
| 3:19:07| I'm fine with making a motion to do that, but I just want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11947)|
| 3:19:10| I wasn't sure either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11950)|
| 3:19:12| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11952)|
| 3:19:14| Due to Amy saying that it's a split zoning, I'm looking at the current map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11954)|
| 3:19:18| And if you look at the current map, here's the current map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11958)|
| 3:19:21| This portion of it is C1 and this was R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11961)|
| 3:19:26| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11966)|
| 3:19:27| Can I come show you this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11967)|
| 3:19:28| Because this is weird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11968)|
| 3:19:30| This is weird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11970)|
| 3:19:31| I'm going to take the EIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11971)|
| 3:19:34| Can I just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11974)|
| 3:19:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11975)|
| 3:19:37| You can explain to me why this is so weird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11977)|
| 3:19:39| Can you see it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11979)|
| 3:19:40| This is the back of the Pratt's door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11980)|
| 3:19:42| And so when I click on this parcel, it's this, all this over here, and this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11982)|
| 3:19:46| What are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11986)|
| 3:19:47| Maybe it's the alarm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11987)|
| 3:19:49| We talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11989)|
| 3:19:50| It's on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11990)|
| 3:19:52| We had one brief whisper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11992)|
| 3:19:54| I have to ask the EIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11994)|
| 3:19:56| Okay, I've lost control of the meeting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11996)|
| 3:19:58| It may have been that it was dated as a single property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=11998)|
| 3:20:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12001)|
| 3:20:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12002)|
| 3:20:05| So we're on McKamey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12005)|
| 3:20:07| And what is the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12007)|
| 3:20:14| I'll make a motion that the lot 23 at McKamey Road be zoned RN4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12014)|
| 3:20:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12021)|
| 3:20:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12023)|
| 3:20:24| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12024)|
| 3:20:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12027)|
| 3:20:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12028)|
| 3:20:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12029)|
| 3:20:30| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12030)|
| 3:20:31| And that is amended to RN4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12031)|
| 3:20:33| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12033)|
| 3:20:35| Anything else from staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12035)|
| 3:20:36| I mean, from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12036)|
| 3:20:38| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12038)|
| 3:20:40| I don't know if either Sandy or Ed want to come address this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12040)|
| 3:20:43| but there's a space in Sequoia Hills at the corner of Kennesaw Avenue in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12043)|
| 3:20:49| Kiwi across from the Sequoia Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12049)|
| 3:20:54| Sandy, do you want to talk about this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12054)|
| 3:20:58| This is going from C1 to CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12058)|
| 3:21:03| Sandy Gillespie, 4272 Holloway Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12063)|
| 3:21:07| I've talked to two of the property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12067)|
| 3:21:10| and they were unaware that they're zoning it, that it had been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12070)|
| 3:21:18| I didn't know exactly what the process was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12078)|
| 3:21:21| I just talked with them yesterday and today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12081)|
| 3:21:24| But I wasn't sure what the process was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12084)|
| 3:21:26| It's not been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12086)|
| 3:21:27| It's proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12087)|
| 3:21:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12088)|
| 3:21:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12089)|
| 3:21:30| They, within the next week, want to submit a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12090)|
| 3:21:38| We think that it's probably more appropriate for the neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12098)|
| 3:21:42| rather than CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12102)|
| 3:21:45| But I know it's the property owner's decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12105)|
| 3:21:49| so I just wanted to be clear on what the process was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12109)|
| 3:21:54| So what is it now, and what is the proposed and draft for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12114)|
| 3:21:59| I think it's currently C1, and it's moving to CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12119)|
| 3:22:04| So, Gerald, what would a zoning neutral change be from C1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12124)|
| 3:22:09| C1 would be CN, but there are size limitations and other standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12129)|
| 3:22:16| CN is truly a small-scale neighborhood designed for small-scale neighborhood stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12136)|
| 3:22:24| Typically a single store or a couple of stores are separate buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12144)|
| 3:22:28| I think, again, maybe the old corner market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12148)|
| 3:22:31| and this is a relatively large shopping area, and the CG2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12151)|
| 3:22:37| which is pedestrian-oriented, seemed more appropriate for the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12157)|
| 3:22:41| I'm not sure that the existing C1 is the best zoning for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12161)|
| 3:22:49| If I were to start again, I realize that what we're proposing is not zone neutral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12169)|
| 3:22:54| but it allows the uses as a better fit for the uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12174)|
| 3:22:57| and the development pattern that's there than the C1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12177)|
| 3:23:00| which provides certain restrictions on size of buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12180)|
| 3:23:04| some design standard limitations that these uses may not meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12184)|
| 3:23:12| I guess my struggle with it, Sandy, is that the owner hasn't asked us to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12192)|
| 3:23:17| And I might feel more comfortable and just ask you the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12197)|
| 3:23:23| You had a discussion with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12203)|
| 3:23:25| I haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12205)|
| 3:23:26| But if we do a zone neutral change to CN, and that was the zone neutral change, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12206)|
| 3:23:34| That would be zone neutral, but, again, it may impact the conformity of the uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12214)|
| 3:23:38| If we make that change, though, would he be able to make a request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12218)|
| 3:23:42| No, his zone neutral is CN, so he would have the zone neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12222)|
| 3:23:48| CG2 would be a higher intensity, and he would have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12228)|
| 3:23:51| He could make the request for CN if he wants, or CG2, but he would have to pay the fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12231)|
| 3:24:01| Okay, he has been changed to CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12241)|
| 3:24:05| But if the council made him zone neutral and he wanted to go to CG2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12245)|
| 3:24:11| he could certainly make the application and pay the fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12251)|
| 3:24:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12255)|
| 3:24:16| Point of clarification, Andrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12256)|
| 3:24:18| Two years ago we had a dollar general on Boyds Bridge Pike, and it was neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12258)|
| 3:24:27| And we didn't have a building size in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12267)|
| 3:24:30| And so that came about, and then we ended up ñ many people thought it was too big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12270)|
| 3:24:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12277)|
| 3:24:38| And so the building was going to be too big, but we didn't have a size restriction on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12278)|
| 3:24:41| So one of the things out of recode was to limit the neighborhood commercial district to a smaller footprint of building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12281)|
| 3:24:49| That would probably prohibit a dollar general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12289)|
| 3:24:53| That was part of the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12293)|
| 3:24:56| It would require a smaller dollar general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12296)|
| 3:24:58| Yeah, smaller dollar general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12298)|
| 3:24:59| That was the arrow that stuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12299)|
| 3:25:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12301)|
| 3:25:02| But anyway, so that was how we got to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12302)|
| 3:25:05| Sandy, what's the use that he's ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12305)|
| 3:25:07| As far as the process goes, I think I'll just talk with the owners, and then they can ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12307)|
| 3:25:14| And, you know, I think what we have is the best approach because it's CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12314)|
| 3:25:20| It would allow the size buildings that's there, make some conforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12320)|
| 3:25:24| And if the owner decides he wants to go back to CN, the zone equivalent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12324)|
| 3:25:29| he could submit an application for no fee after this process is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12329)|
| 3:25:34| I think we give him the best options with the proposal we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12334)|
| 3:25:38| If we made him zone neutral and he didn't like being non-conforming buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12338)|
| 3:25:43| he could still apply, but he'd have to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12343)|
| 3:25:46| This way he gets a free chance for reconsideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12346)|
| 3:25:51| Sandy, what's the use right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12351)|
| 3:25:54| What use does the owner have with this property right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12354)|
| 3:25:57| What are they doing there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12357)|
| 3:25:58| C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12358)|
| 3:26:00| No, no, but what's the use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12360)|
| 3:26:02| It's a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12362)|
| 3:26:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12363)|
| 3:26:04| It's the plaid apron restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12364)|
| 3:26:06| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12366)|
| 3:26:07| And then the realty office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12367)|
| 3:26:09| So is there any issue with changing it to CN| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12369)|
| 3:26:12| and that being not in line with the use that they're using currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12372)|
| 3:26:16| It's not the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12376)|
| 3:26:17| It's the size of the building that may not conform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12377)|
| 3:26:20| So it would be non-conforming due to size, not use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12380)|
| 3:26:24| It would be a non-conforming structure, not a non-conforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12384)|
| 3:26:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12389)|
| 3:26:30| We'll work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12390)|
| 3:26:31| It causes other problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12391)|
| 3:26:32| It causes other problems when you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12392)|
| 3:26:35| Well, I guess that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12395)|
| 3:26:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12398)|
| 3:26:39| Okay, so it sounds like if it stays the way it's proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12399)|
| 3:26:43| then if he wants to be zone neutral, he can get that for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12403)|
| 3:26:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12407)|
| 3:26:48| He can go back and request that for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12408)|
| 3:26:50| Otherwise, if he doesn't like it, then he's going to have to pay to get to the CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12410)|
| 3:26:56| So, Sandy, I guess this makes me uncomfortable, making this change from an owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12416)|
| 3:27:04| But I understand the rationale for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12424)|
| 3:27:07| So what I want you to communicate to the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12427)|
| 3:27:09| and you can give him my cell phone number, if they want to change this back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12429)|
| 3:27:13| we may not be able to do it during the MAP discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12433)|
| 3:27:16| but Gerald will do it for free, free of charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12436)|
| 3:27:20| And I will definitely do whatever I can to assist with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12440)|
| 3:27:24| But this is my struggle with not doing zone neutral stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12444)|
| 3:27:29| So if you're okay with it, I'll leave it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12449)|
| 3:27:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12452)|
| 3:27:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12453)|
| 3:27:34| And, in fact, it doesn't affect any current use anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12454)|
| 3:27:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12456)|
| 3:27:37| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12457)|
| 3:27:38| And this is one of the struggles we had trying to maintain zone neutrality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12458)|
| 3:27:42| But when a new zone that would be zone neutral made the use or the structure nonconforming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12462)|
| 3:27:53| we didn't want to create nonconforming structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12473)|
| 3:27:56| And that took a higher priority than zone neutrality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12476)|
| 3:27:59| And there were only a very few instances of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12479)|
| 3:28:02| But, you know, it's trying to meet all these goals, which sometimes were competing goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12482)|
| 3:28:07| and it's challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12487)|
| 3:28:10| And then trying to comply with the plans and policies adopted by council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12490)|
| 3:28:16| and wishes of a diverse community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12496)|
| 3:28:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12503)|
| 3:28:24| So other council questions or changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12504)|
| 3:28:29| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12509)|
| 3:28:30| Well, I was going to ask if we could just kind of stay on task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12510)|
| 3:28:32| I thought that Mr. Graham was next, and then I have some as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12512)|
| 3:28:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12515)|
| 3:28:36| I just didn't want anybody else to keep jumping in front of my constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12516)|
| 3:28:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12520)|
| 3:28:42| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12522)|
| 3:28:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12524)|
| 3:28:45| Mr. Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12525)|
| 3:28:46| Before Mr. Graham gets up, I want to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12526)|
| 3:28:50| and he pointed out to me that it's not 6, 7, and 10 that I had a challenge with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12530)|
| 3:28:56| It was 6, 9, and 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12536)|
| 3:28:57| I was trying to respond to that e-mail very quickly before I got to other meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12537)|
| 3:29:03| and to this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12543)|
| 3:29:04| So on his list, it's 6, 9, and 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12544)|
| 3:29:10| That you are opposed to at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12550)|
| 3:29:13| That we need to discuss probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12553)|
| 3:29:16| Because they would be categorical changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12556)|
| 3:29:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12559)|
| 3:29:20| And that needs to go through a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12560)|
| 3:29:22| So if we could have a motion for all but 6, 9, and 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12562)|
| 3:29:26| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12566)|
| 3:29:27| Let me look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12567)|
| 3:29:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12568)|
| 3:29:29| Yeah, we need to talk about what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12569)|
| 3:29:30| Some of these are my districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12570)|
| 3:29:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12572)|
| 3:29:33| So there might be people behind you that might come over here and jump on me if I don't speak up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12573)|
| 3:29:38| So pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12578)|
| 3:29:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12579)|
| 3:29:40| So do you want him to walk through each of these quickly or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12580)|
| 3:29:42| Well, let me just pull it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12582)|
| 3:29:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12584)|
| 3:29:45| And I had sent you an e-mail pretty late in the game to say what was the rationale for requesting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12585)|
| 3:29:53| So however you want to proceed, I'm pulling them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12593)|
| 3:29:56| Well, I can talk generally that most of these are big box shopping centers, big tracks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12596)|
| 3:30:02| and most of them are developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12602)|
| 3:30:08| What's left to be developed is probably going to be small partials, big box developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12608)|
| 3:30:13| a little slow right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12613)|
| 3:30:16| But so I think Gerald, some of them were proposed as like CH1 and we're just asking for CH2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12616)|
| 3:30:27| Some of them were like the Isaiah's Landing at Easttown, which is an area that's struggling right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12627)|
| 3:30:38| We have C6, which has actually some industrial uses, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12638)|
| 3:30:44| And his proposed map was CR2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12644)|
| 3:30:47| We're just asking for CH2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12647)|
| 3:30:49| And that's actually a lower intensity than CR2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12649)|
| 3:30:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12652)|
| 3:30:55| I never cease to be amazed by Mr. Graham, asking for less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12655)|
| 3:31:00| So Mr. Graham basically wants us to down zone all of his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12660)|
| 3:31:03| Is that what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12663)|
| 3:31:04| Or at least one piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12664)|
| 3:31:06| This is public, so everybody heard it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12666)|
| 3:31:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12669)|
| 3:31:10| That's number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12670)|
| 3:31:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12671)|
| 3:31:12| So I think our maps, the one thing that I think we did miss in outlining was on South Grove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12672)|
| 3:31:22| I think the front lot should probably be CH2 also or at the minimum CH1, the front lots along Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12682)|
| 3:31:33| They're all developed anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12693)|
| 3:31:34| I mean, Chick-fil-A, CVS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12694)|
| 3:31:37| But there is a little bit of undeveloped land that would probably be better zoned as a CH zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12697)|
| 3:31:48| So on number eight, then South Grove, it says the existing zoning is C3 and C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12708)|
| 3:31:54| The proposed is CR1 and CH1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12714)|
| 3:31:57| And then what you have requested is CR2 and CH1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12717)|
| 3:32:02| We marked through the CR2 and asked for CH2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12722)|
| 3:32:06| Say mark through the CR2 and you just want CH2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12726)|
| 3:32:10| CH2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12730)|
| 3:32:11| That's number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12731)|
| 3:32:12| That's number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12732)|
| 3:32:13| That's number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12733)|
| 3:32:14| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12734)|
| 3:32:15| That was the confusing one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12735)|
| 3:32:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12736)|
| 3:32:17| And then Mr. Graham, for those two front lots on Chapman Highway that are CR1, CH1 would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12737)|
| 3:32:23| Those should be CH, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12743)|
| 3:32:25| There's Highway Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12745)|
| 3:32:27| It seems like they should be CH1 or 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12747)|
| 3:32:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12750)|
| 3:32:31| Whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12751)|
| 3:32:32| Especially along at that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12752)|
| 3:32:34| Along Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12754)|
| 3:32:35| Not Alcoa Highway, but John Zavier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12755)|
| 3:32:38| Chapman Highway, that's certainly Highway Oriented Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12758)|
| 3:32:50| I think most of the maps that are attached, except for that one South Grove revision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12770)|
| 3:32:58| are what we would request on those, what, seven properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12778)|
| 3:33:03| Seven out of ten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12783)|
| 3:33:07| Which ones are you taking out, Tim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12787)|
| 3:33:10| Well, we're still going to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12790)|
| 3:33:12| Six, nine, and ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12792)|
| 3:33:14| Six, nine, and ten you're going to discuss a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12794)|
| 3:33:17| Not tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12797)|
| 3:33:18| You mean it's going to be part of a rezoning process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12798)|
| 3:33:21| No, we can have a brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12801)|
| 3:33:23| I just had like probably five minutes to discuss those three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12803)|
| 3:33:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12807)|
| 3:33:28| Nothing big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12808)|
| 3:33:29| But that's not what you're asking for change tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12809)|
| 3:33:33| Or you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12813)|
| 3:33:35| He's asking, you're asking for this full list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12815)|
| 3:33:38| Well, I'm asking for the list, I would just take the easy ones first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12818)|
| 3:33:42| Okay, first we'll take the easy ones, which means everything but six, nine, and ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12822)|
| 3:33:48| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12828)|
| 3:33:49| And Gerald, you agree with all but six, nine, and ten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12829)|
| 3:33:54| I think all those are reasonable, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12834)|
| 3:33:56| And there's a correction on South Grove frontage, the Chapman Highway frontage, making that CH also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12836)|
| 3:34:03| So number eight would be changed to CH2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12843)|
| 3:34:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12846)|
| 3:34:07| Gerald, do you all have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12847)|
| 3:34:08| Yes, I have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12848)|
| 3:34:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12849)|
| 3:34:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12850)|
| 3:34:11| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12851)|
| 3:34:12| Okay, you'll make a motion to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12852)|
| 3:34:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12854)|
| 3:34:15| That was the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12855)|
| 3:34:16| Okay, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12856)|
| 3:34:17| Okay, so Councilwoman Welch, you've got a question about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12857)|
| 3:34:22| I just want to make sure we're real clear because I heard Councilwoman McKenzie say we're changing that to CH2, and we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12862)|
| 3:34:29| We're changing the big parcel to CH2 as requested, but then the two parcels that are CR1, that front Chapman Highway, would be CH1 and not CH2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12869)|
| 3:34:41| Number eight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12881)|
| 3:34:42| Number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12882)|
| 3:34:43| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12883)|
| 3:34:44| Just number eight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12884)|
| 3:34:45| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12885)|
| 3:34:46| CH number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12886)|
| 3:34:47| That's number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12887)|
| 3:34:49| I don't mind even pulling that out because it's not what's in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12889)|
| 3:34:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12892)|
| 3:34:53| So number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12893)|
| 3:34:54| On number eight, the requested zone, if you look at the map, the big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12894)|
| 3:35:03| So which ones are those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12903)|
| 3:35:05| The big tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12905)|
| 3:35:06| The big tracks, the big purple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12906)|
| 3:35:08| There's the large purple behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12908)|
| 3:35:12| Well, the first, there's the frontage, which says CR1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12912)|
| 3:35:15| That's the Lowe's and the Chick-fil-A down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12915)|
| 3:35:21| Mr. Graham, that's the Lowe's and the Chick-fil-A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12921)|
| 3:35:25| We're trying to make sure we understand the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12925)|
| 3:35:27| The Lowe's, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12927)|
| 3:35:28| That's the main shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12928)|
| 3:35:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12930)|
| 3:35:31| At John Sevier and Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12931)|
| 3:35:33| But the lots between Chapman Highway and Mountain Grove Drive, they say CR1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12933)|
| 3:35:38| Those would be CH1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12938)|
| 3:35:40| You want those to be CH1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12940)|
| 3:35:42| CH1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12942)|
| 3:35:44| And then the lot that's behind that, it would be as requested, CH2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12944)|
| 3:35:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12949)|
| 3:35:50| So I would make a motion to make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12950)|
| 3:35:52| And that's the only one that's different than what's in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12952)|
| 3:35:54| Well, let's make an amendment to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12954)|
| 3:35:56| Is that appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12956)|
| 3:35:58| You can adopt that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12958)|
| 3:35:59| We can remove it and start over if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12959)|
| 3:36:04| See, we had a motion on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12964)|
| 3:36:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12966)|
| 3:36:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12967)|
| 3:36:08| And it was seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12968)|
| 3:36:09| It was seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12969)|
| 3:36:11| We can have one substitute motion to that if somebody wants to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12971)|
| 3:36:15| Which I think Ms. McKenzie did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12975)|
| 3:36:18| So you want to offer a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12978)|
| 3:36:20| Offer a substitute motion to include CH1 for the number 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12980)|
| 3:36:27| Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12987)|
| 3:36:28| Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12988)|
| 3:36:29| And then adopt the rest of the previous motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12989)|
| 3:36:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12992)|
| 3:36:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12993)|
| 3:36:34| I'm good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12994)|
| 3:36:35| And I would accept that as a friendly motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12995)|
| 3:36:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12996)|
| 3:36:37| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12997)|
| 3:36:38| Everybody got it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12998)|
| 3:36:39| Gerald, you've got it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=12999)|
| 3:36:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13000)|
| 3:36:41| Jamie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13001)|
| 3:36:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13002)|
| 3:36:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13003)|
| 3:36:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13004)|
| 3:36:45| Six is not on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13005)|
| 3:36:47| Neither is nine nor ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13007)|
| 3:36:49| Six, nine, and ten are not included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13009)|
| 3:36:51| Everything but six, nine, and ten as amended there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13011)|
| 3:36:55| As proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13015)|
| 3:36:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13016)|
| 3:36:57| As proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13017)|
| 3:36:58| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13018)|
| 3:36:59| Everybody clear on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13019)|
| 3:37:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13020)|
| 3:37:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13021)|
| 3:37:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13022)|
| 3:37:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13023)|
| 3:37:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13024)|
| 3:37:05| That passes 9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13025)|
| 3:37:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13027)|
| 3:37:08| Now, do you want to speak on number six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13028)|
| 3:37:16| Mr. Graham, do you want to talk about six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13036)|
| 3:37:19| So I understand about the CG zone in the Fountain City area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13039)|
| 3:37:23| and Carlene educated me about some of the uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13043)|
| 3:37:29| I guess I just wanted to go on record and be sure I understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13049)|
| 3:37:35| the CG zone, I went down and looked whether it's what the special use is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13055)|
| 3:37:45| the S, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13065)|
| 3:37:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13066)|
| 3:37:47| So car wash, drive-through facilities, gas stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13067)|
| 3:37:59| are all permitted as a special use, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13079)|
| 3:38:02| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13082)|
| 3:38:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13083)|
| 3:38:04| Retails, of course it's retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13084)|
| 3:38:11| Vehicle repair service like Firestone or whatever, that's a special use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13091)|
| 3:38:17| Special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13097)|
| 3:38:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13098)|
| 3:38:19| And so right now today we're C3, and there is no special use required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13099)|
| 3:38:25| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13105)|
| 3:38:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13106)|
| 3:38:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13107)|
| 3:38:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13108)|
| 3:38:29| So go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13109)|
| 3:38:31| The reason for that is CG is proposed as a pedestrian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13111)|
| 3:38:36| more pedestrian-friendly zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13116)|
| 3:38:38| We're moving as we see more emphasis on walkability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13118)|
| 3:38:43| trying to improve the walkability of some of our corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13123)|
| 3:38:46| So by having these as special uses, we can address access, design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13126)|
| 3:38:52| We all know that even though some people may lament an auto repair store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13132)|
| 3:38:59| it's nice to have, I'll speak from my experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13139)|
| 3:39:02| a special tire conveniently located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13142)|
| 3:39:04| So those are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13144)|
| 3:39:06| But let's look at the new ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13146)|
| 3:39:08| and ensure that they consider the pedestrian as well as the automobiles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13148)|
| 3:39:13| that are pulling into them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13153)|
| 3:39:15| And that's the reason for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13155)|
| 3:39:16| So with that said, I wanted to get Ms. Filone on record here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13156)|
| 3:39:19| Oh, my gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13159)|
| 3:39:21| You don't have her on your side, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13161)|
| 3:39:23| She's got big eyes right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13163)|
| 3:39:26| Carly Malone on record, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13166)|
| 3:39:29| Here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13169)|
| 3:39:31| That whole area from 640 north to beyond the park is C3 and zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13171)|
| 3:39:38| To introduce CH, that's CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13178)|
| 3:39:42| To introduce CH, which would be C4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13182)|
| 3:39:45| would be out of context with the rest of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13185)|
| 3:39:48| And also, as I pointed out to Mr. Graham, there are bigger setbacks in CH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13188)|
| 3:39:53| And this is a very small piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13193)|
| 3:39:56| And Fountain City Town Hall would support the redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13196)|
| 3:39:58| of this very small shopping center and work with Mr. Graham any way we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13198)|
| 3:40:04| We would not be opposed to a drive-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13204)|
| 3:40:06| We would not be opposed to a car wash or auto repair or gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13206)|
| 3:40:14| They're up and down Broadway right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13214)|
| 3:40:17| The ability to have some input would be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13217)|
| 3:40:23| But to introduce CH, which is C4, which is totally out of context with the rest of the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13223)|
| 3:40:29| would not help in walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13229)|
| 3:40:31| And we do hope to have sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13231)|
| 3:40:34| It would really be a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13234)|
| 3:40:36| And I think Mr. Graham, I gave him my phone number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13236)|
| 3:40:38| I think Mr. Graham and I have worked on other projects before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13238)|
| 3:40:41| and I think we can work on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13241)|
| 3:40:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13243)|
| 3:40:44| Okay, but you are opposed to the rezoning that he's requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13244)|
| 3:40:47| With that said, I'll withdraw that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13247)|
| 3:40:51| Thank you, Mr. Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13251)|
| 3:40:57| But she did say she'd work with you on the other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13257)|
| 3:40:59| I heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13259)|
| 3:41:00| She was okay with my uses, too, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13260)|
| 3:41:02| He was shaking his head yes the whole time you were talking, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13262)|
| 3:41:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13266)|
| 3:41:07| Same with number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13267)|
| 3:41:08| Okay, how about number nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13268)|
| 3:41:10| Same issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13270)|
| 3:41:11| Not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13271)|
| 3:41:12| Again, I know there's been a lot of history about these Broadway, Magnolia, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13272)|
| 3:41:20| Of course, I grew up over on that side of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13280)|
| 3:41:22| Wait a minute, not nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13282)|
| 3:41:24| But not sure why CH zone wouldn't be appropriate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13284)|
| 3:41:29| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13289)|
| 3:41:30| Are we talking about, just to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13290)|
| 3:41:32| Corner of Spruce and Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13292)|
| 3:41:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13294)|
| 3:41:35| Okay, so the maps are what's wrong here with the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13295)|
| 3:41:38| You've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13298)|
| 3:41:40| Spruce Street and Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13300)|
| 3:41:41| It says nine at the very top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13301)|
| 3:41:43| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13303)|
| 3:41:44| Nine for Magnolia, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13304)|
| 3:41:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13305)|
| 3:41:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13306)|
| 3:41:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13307)|
| 3:41:48| So that, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13308)|
| 3:41:51| So is this thing zoning C3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13311)|
| 3:41:54| Draft four has a CG2, and you're requesting CH2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13314)|
| 3:41:58| Yeah, and it's corner lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13318)|
| 3:42:00| And CG is the zone equivalent of C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13320)|
| 3:42:05| Again, trying to increase the pedestrian friendliness of Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13325)|
| 3:42:10| We feel that CG is appropriate, and as Mr. Graham pointed out earlier, gas stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13330)|
| 3:42:18| everything from a gas station to a car wash to a mixed-use building that has a coffee shop on the first floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13338)|
| 3:42:26| with residential above is permitted in CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13346)|
| 3:42:30| So we feel that's appropriate, especially as we try to make Magnolia more pedestrian friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13350)|
| 3:42:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13360)|
| 3:42:41| So are you withdrawing that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13361)|
| 3:42:46| Is there a motion in either way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13366)|
| 3:42:49| I'm not hearing one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13369)|
| 3:42:50| Well, Mr. Graham, are you withdrawing number nine, or do you still want us to consider that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13370)|
| 3:42:55| Well, I guess I'll withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13375)|
| 3:42:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13379)|
| 3:43:00| Now, since he's withdrawing it and it's staying the way that it was changed, he can do the free appeal, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13380)|
| 3:43:08| No, because the CG is the zone equivalent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13388)|
| 3:43:12| He, as I said, would be happy to receive an application and have it go through the process and accept Mr. Graham's check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13392)|
| 3:43:20| But it is a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13400)|
| 3:43:23| So this is more similar to what's there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13403)|
| 3:43:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13408)|
| 3:43:29| So you're comfortable withdrawing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13409)|
| 3:43:30| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13410)|
| 3:43:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13411)|
| 3:43:32| Okay, number 10, New Hope Press Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13412)|
| 3:43:35| Well, that's one that we just put under contract literally two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13415)|
| 3:43:40| And as you look at the zoning map, you can see that we have an O zone that borders it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13420)|
| 3:43:45| It's on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13425)|
| 3:43:47| The church has moved to Powell, the whole body, and they're selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13427)|
| 3:43:52| They contacted us, wanted us to buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13432)|
| 3:43:54| We ended up putting a contract on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13434)|
| 3:43:57| And since you turned me down on the previous two, I thought I'd just go ahead and ask for extension of the O zone to that corner lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13437)|
| 3:44:06| And I'm sure, because Mr. Hamilton's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13446)|
| 3:44:09| So if you go ahead and do it tonight, you don't have to deal with Mr. Hamilton later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13449)|
| 3:44:16| So there's some benefit to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13456)|
| 3:44:18| And I'm sure David wouldn't mind me saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13458)|
| 3:44:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13462)|
| 3:44:23| Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13463)|
| 3:44:24| The challenge here is that it would be a changing category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13464)|
| 3:44:28| This is the property under the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13468)|
| 3:44:31| It's R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13471)|
| 3:44:32| And, you know, we're proposing it for R1 under the new zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13472)|
| 3:44:39| So that is zone neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13479)|
| 3:44:41| So what staff is suggesting is zone neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13481)|
| 3:44:45| What Mr. Graham is requesting is a change from residential to office, as he stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13485)|
| 3:44:50| And so we're just following, trying to adhere to what council member?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13490)|
| 3:44:55| So, Gerald, let me ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13495)|
| 3:44:57| If I made this application, would you support an office zone for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13497)|
| 3:45:01| I'd have to look at the sector plan designation and confer with my staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13501)|
| 3:45:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13505)|
| 3:45:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13508)|
| 3:45:09| Mr. Graham, did you want to withdraw that one as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13509)|
| 3:45:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13511)|
| 3:45:12| I want you to vote on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13512)|
| 3:45:13| You want to vote on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13513)|
| 3:45:15| Well, you would have to get a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13515)|
| 3:45:17| We'll see if there's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13517)|
| 3:45:18| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13518)|
| 3:45:19| We can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13519)|
| 3:45:20| It does join office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13520)|
| 3:45:21| We've done a lot of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13521)|
| 3:45:24| I mean, we've sent a lot of people to Gerald and given him a lot of latitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13524)|
| 3:45:28| So I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13528)|
| 3:45:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13530)|
| 3:45:31| So the motion and second is to change this to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13531)|
| 3:45:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13539)|
| 3:45:40| Mr. Graham, I was at this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13540)|
| 3:45:44| Seema was out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13544)|
| 3:45:46| And they asked me to come and talk about recode when she couldn't make it to one of their meetings at that church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13546)|
| 3:45:52| And this was something they specifically brought up to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13552)|
| 3:45:55| And so I can't support this, knowing that conversation occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13555)|
| 3:46:00| And, again, if you want to apply and go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13560)|
| 3:46:06| And help us wherever it ends up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13566)|
| 3:46:09| It's a logical zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13569)|
| 3:46:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13571)|
| 3:46:12| It's office zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13572)|
| 3:46:14| You know, I don't know what you do with a 60-year-old building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13574)|
| 3:46:18| I'm going to figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13578)|
| 3:46:20| If we can get office zone, maybe we can keep the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13580)|
| 3:46:23| If we don't, maybe it gets demoed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13583)|
| 3:46:26| You know, no promises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13586)|
| 3:46:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13588)|
| 3:46:29| So there is a motion, though, to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13589)|
| 3:46:31| We'll just see what the will of council is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13591)|
| 3:46:34| Yeah, I mean, I have concerns as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13594)|
| 3:46:36| I mean, you know, I don't want to thwart the zoning process, you know, without.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13596)|
| 3:46:42| I mean, I think, obviously, a church in an R zone needs to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13602)|
| 3:46:47| But, you know, I hate to use this process to thwart the typical zoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13607)|
| 3:46:56| I don't think that's the intent of recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13616)|
| 3:46:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13618)|
| 3:46:59| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13619)|
| 3:47:01| Mr. Graham, today when we talked, you said you may end up renting it out to another church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13621)|
| 3:47:06| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13626)|
| 3:47:07| I may do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13627)|
| 3:47:09| And then what are you going to do with the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13629)|
| 3:47:11| I've had it for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13631)|
| 3:47:12| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13632)|
| 3:47:13| Then what are you going to do with the zoning at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13633)|
| 3:47:16| Well, I think a church is permitted in about any zone, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13636)|
| 3:47:20| Yeah, any zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13640)|
| 3:47:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13641)|
| 3:47:22| So that would allow you to go either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13642)|
| 3:47:24| You know, there's a lot of startup churches that just need a little help, and we can do that for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13644)|
| 3:47:32| But they don't need, I think it's 10,000 or 11,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13652)|
| 3:47:36| So it's a big building that probably we could subdivide, maybe let the church use the sanctuary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13656)|
| 3:47:42| and rent the other offices and whatnot for someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13662)|
| 3:47:51| Similar to, is it the big accounting firm took a school and turned it into their offices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13671)|
| 3:47:59| PYA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13679)|
| 3:48:00| That's it, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13680)|
| 3:48:01| Pursing or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13681)|
| 3:48:03| It's really going to be kind of interesting, but you do need some zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13683)|
| 3:48:07| You can't do it with our zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13687)|
| 3:48:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13688)|
| 3:48:09| And O was the logical thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13689)|
| 3:48:11| And so, you know, we could have some flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13691)|
| 3:48:17| We certainly need that in this climate today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13697)|
| 3:48:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13701)|
| 3:48:22| So, Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13702)|
| 3:48:23| Thank you, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13703)|
| 3:48:25| Let me clarify, you said you attended a meeting with Norwood residents about this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13705)|
| 3:48:30| and they were not happy about it going office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13710)|
| 3:48:33| I attended a meeting about recode to explain recode to them some time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13713)|
| 3:48:38| I can't remember what it was, but they brought up that the church was potentially going for sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13718)|
| 3:48:45| and concerns about it and where it would go and zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13725)|
| 3:48:48| And so, I feel like the public process needs to be, they're not here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13728)|
| 3:48:52| and I'm just not comfortable with not doing a neutral zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13732)|
| 3:48:56| What's been posted is a neutral zoning, and I'm not comfortable with supporting a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13736)|
| 3:49:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13742)|
| 3:49:03| I concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13743)|
| 3:49:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13744)|
| 3:49:05| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13745)|
| 3:49:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13748)|
| 3:49:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13749)|
| 3:49:10| So, we have a motion and a second to approve his request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13750)|
| 3:49:14| We may need a roll call on this, but all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13754)|
| 3:49:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13759)|
| 3:49:20| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13760)|
| 3:49:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13761)|
| 3:49:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13762)|
| 3:49:23| Well, no wins, but let's get the roll call so we know exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13763)|
| 3:49:27| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13767)|
| 3:49:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13768)|
| 3:49:29| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13769)|

| 3:49:33| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13773)|
| 3:49:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13774)|
| 3:49:35| Councilman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13775)|
| 3:49:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13776)|
| 3:49:37| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13777)|
| 3:49:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13778)|
| 3:49:39| Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13779)|
| 3:49:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13781)|
| 3:49:42| Councilman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13782)|
| 3:49:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13783)|
| 3:49:44| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13784)|
| 3:49:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13785)|
| 3:49:46| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13786)|
| 3:49:47| 6-3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13787)|
| 3:49:48| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13788)|
| 3:49:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13789)|
| 3:49:50| So, it failed 6-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13790)|
| 3:49:51| Thank you, Mr. Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13791)|
| 3:49:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13792)|
| 3:49:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13793)|
| 3:49:54| That's his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=13794)|

| 3:53:38| predominantly take up the whole block almost except for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14018)|
| 3:53:41| two parts or. Two houses on either end that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14021)|
| 3:53:45| not part of the school but otherwise all of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14025)|
| 3:53:48| is actually bad this tabernacle school. The first two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14028)|
| 3:53:52| houses down the corner. That's Bruce and feel. Those two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14032)|
| 3:53:59| houses are actually single family houses. One I'm actually has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14039)|
| 3:54:03| a. A.D. you are in the backyards minister long since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14043)|
| 3:54:07| I've been there was a bar a garage covered Rick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14047)|
| 3:54:09| converted into a. Which they didn't know what it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14049)|
| 3:54:13| that's what it is now. But the only. Multifamily housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14053)|
| 3:54:20| on that whole strip there we see it says are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14060)|
| 3:54:22| in for is all the way up at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14062)|
| 3:54:25| top corner there next to chestnut right there. That is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14065)|
| 3:54:28| an old bill probably in the twenties apartment building. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14068)|
| 3:54:33| been there you know since the twenties. So we're kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14073)|
| 3:54:36| of asking for that to be because that is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14076)|
| 3:54:39| school. And I know there's kind of if you think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14079)|
| 3:54:42| about. You know it's not a public who is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14082)|
| 3:54:45| private school but still it is a school. I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14085)|
| 3:54:48| have a school zone from my house. So it seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14088)|
| 3:54:51| almost logical for it to be zoned as a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14091)|
| 3:54:54| Because if you go back to the whole thing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14094)|
| 3:54:56| was some of the buses earlier. They have buses which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14096)|
| 3:55:00| is actually their church they use the buses for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14100)|
| 3:55:02| church but they've got three or four buses parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14102)|
| 3:55:04| over there. So if that goes to any kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14104)|
| 3:55:07| residential. Then they may not be able to keep their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14107)|
| 3:55:10| buses there. If you come down to the opposite corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14110)|
| 3:55:15| there. On down the lower. And there that building on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14115)|
| 3:55:20| the corner that Stewart Manor. Which is another old apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14120)|
| 3:55:25| building. Beside it is actually a single family house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14125)|
| 3:55:29| Cross the street is another. Old apartment building was built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14129)|
| 3:55:33| like in the sixties and beside it is actually where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14133)|
| 3:55:36| the P.C.O. used to own that house on the corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14136)|
| 3:55:39| there. And that is actually a duplex. But I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14139)|
| 3:55:43| kind of really kind of where we're looking at. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14143)|
| 3:55:47| you talk about a. Established neighborhood you're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14147)|
| 3:55:52| an established neighborhood. If you've got lots the size of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14152)|
| 3:55:55| an acre I'm sorry that's not established neighborhood. But you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14155)|
| 3:55:59| know this actually is an established neighborhood. You know here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14159)|
| 3:56:03| we have houses that are sitting on. You know said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14163)|
| 3:56:06| if I have seven thousand seventy five hundred square foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14166)|
| 3:56:08| lots. You know and you're talking about some neighborhoods having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14168)|
| 3:56:12| you know established neighborhoods have been one acre. You're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14172)|
| 3:56:15| about five to six houses in our neighborhood. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14175)|
| 3:56:18| know last week the gentleman mentioned about three acre lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14178)|
| 3:56:22| In our neighborhood that's fifteen to eighteen houses. So actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14182)|
| 3:56:27| what what we're kind of looking at when when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14187)|
| 3:56:30| map first came out map. Two or whatever. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14190)|
| 3:56:33| saw that was all this R.N. two and I looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14193)|
| 3:56:36| what R.N. two was well that's. Duplexes on review. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14196)|
| 3:56:41| not opposed to ADUs. You know because actually that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14201)|
| 3:56:44| kind of increase density. And that would probably help some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14204)|
| 3:56:47| of the people in our neighborhood. That are living there aging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14207)|
| 3:56:51| in their big Victorian house that might be not not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14211)|
| 3:56:54| be as they start to get older might be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14214)|
| 3:56:55| to maintain it and that would be a way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14215)|
| 3:56:58| they could help maintain their house or move into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14218)|
| 3:57:01| and rent out the big house that can live in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14221)|
| 3:57:03| some smaller. So I guess kind of what we're what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14223)|
| 3:57:06| I'm looking forward to is. Our neighborhood was built dance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14226)|
| 3:57:13| We don't need a bunch of multifamily more multifamily pushed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14233)|
| 3:57:17| into our neighborhood. And we're not map five come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14237)|
| 3:57:21| and I pulled it up look at the whole map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14241)|
| 3:57:22| it looks like our neighborhood. All of a sudden come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14242)|
| 3:57:25| up with smallpox because it's not come up all over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14245)|
| 3:57:28| it. And to take a. 7500 square foot lot. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14248)|
| 3:57:34| has something built on it that's nonconforming now. Making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14254)|
| 3:57:38| it orange now doesn't make it conforming either so it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14258)|
| 3:57:42| still will be nonconforming. So. That's my stand. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14262)|
| 3:57:48| Mr. and some of the reason for the map for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14268)|
| 3:57:53| three. Three maybe maybe map to where we. Designated. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14273)|
| 3:57:59| got a real push from the bring back their orange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14279)|
| 3:58:02| And we did more are in for we've dropped back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14282)|
| 3:58:05| significantly we tried to look at tax records and. Meters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14285)|
| 3:58:10| on. On houses driving by to identify where existing multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14290)|
| 3:58:15| was or is located. And again on in the R1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14295)|
| 3:58:20| a multifamily is permitted along. Streets with the minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14300)|
| 3:58:24| designation of collectors of some of those are permitted uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14304)|
| 3:58:29| Even though the the density may exceed the current standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14309)|
| 3:58:32| this block the. For the school is seen with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14312)|
| 3:58:37| existing apartments bookending it and not we're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14317)|
| 3:58:41| look at five ten fifteen twenty years down. The road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14321)|
| 3:58:45| and as much as I hope the Knoxville Baptist school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14325)|
| 3:58:48| remains there. If it doesn't being next to the. To| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14328)|
| 3:58:53| magnolia and the transit lines and transit to write the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14333)|
| 3:58:57| community makes a good location for transition from. The church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14337)|
| 3:59:01| and school to to are in for as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14341)|
| 3:59:04| small scale multifamily that requires special use review of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14344)|
| 3:59:08| any. Development more than four units a building or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14348)|
| 3:59:12| than eight buildings in total so that seemed appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14352)|
| 3:59:15| I understand Mister Nix's concerns and. We're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14355)|
| 3:59:20| to appease a lot of different voices in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14360)|
| 3:59:23| and looking places and as you go down. On what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14363)|
| 3:59:27| by going some of those. Requests for. Are in one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14367)|
| 3:59:34| designation down here but you see what we change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14374)|
| 3:59:37| are in for is currently I three. Industrial. So. Is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14377)|
| 3:59:42| that a significant change. Yes it's significant but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14382)|
| 3:59:46| certainly better addresses the concerns of the neighborhood and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14386)|
| 3:59:49| the current industrial zoning. In which all those homes are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14389)|
| 3:59:53| nonconforming uses. Again trying to trying to appease a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14393)|
| 3:59:59| lot of different voices and then there we didn't do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14399)|
| 4:00:02| this randomly we spent a lot of time looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14402)|
| 4:00:05| these maps. Drive driven. Fifth Avenue so much that. No| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14405)|
| 4:00:12| almost as well as my neighborhood and and reminiscent. Right. Down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14412)|
| 4:00:20| Off the map here where a friend of mine lived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14420)|
| 4:00:22| in. When I was in graduate school we had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14422)|
| 4:00:24| food buying group that was one of the foundations of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14424)|
| 4:00:27| three rivers. Co-op so. I have a lot of familiarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14427)|
| 4:00:31| and a lot of sensitivity to. What was in random| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14431)|
| 4:00:34| and we're trying to have a try to have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14434)|
| 4:00:37| justification and I definitely understand great because the you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14437)|
| 4:00:41| know that we see that I you know I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14441)|
| 4:00:44| They they're actually has been though though let me has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14444)|
| 4:00:47| you know it's going to be nonconforming now for or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14447)|
| 4:00:49| in for if that goes through because the electrical company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14449)|
| 4:00:52| which is across the street there. On Jefferson has actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14452)|
| 4:00:56| built a warehouse there now. And so is there with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14456)|
| 4:00:59| the mapping. And so this is going to be you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14459)|
| 4:01:01| know so but. You know when that was put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14461)|
| 4:01:03| his arm. You know as far as an eyes was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14463)|
| 4:01:06| industrial you look now you see houses if you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14466)|
| 4:01:09| back through the old. Aerial mounds even back when that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14469)|
| 4:01:14| was zoned industrial that was all houses so somebody had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14474)|
| 4:01:17| an idea you know pardon that you look. In your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14477)|
| 4:01:20| down the road with somebody sixty years ago had an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14480)|
| 4:01:24| idea that all those houses will be gone and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14484)|
| 4:01:26| will be industrial. Well that never really happened. You know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14486)|
| 4:01:30| and it was houses when it was industrial was put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14490)|
| 4:01:32| on it. So it was kind of erroneously you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14492)|
| 4:01:36| maybe there was you know hands or foresight looking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14496)|
| 4:01:38| put industrial over that. But then it doesn't ever came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14498)|
| 4:01:42| in those houses that are sitting there now some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14502)|
| 4:01:44| the small shotguns. Those houses actually predate. That even being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14504)|
| 4:01:50| not so that was Park City when that was how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14510)|
| 4:01:53| So those houses predate zoning. So those houses there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14513)|
| 4:01:58| something with. Chris house on. The seventeen her block. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14518)|
| 4:02:04| know it's on office. There's no options there it's all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14524)|
| 4:02:08| single family houses. So at some point somebody thought it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14528)|
| 4:02:10| did that I didn't put offices there. Well it never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14530)|
| 4:02:14| happened. You know so therefore it's it's houses now it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14534)|
| 4:02:18| never looks like it's ever going to be to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14538)|
| 4:02:20| them come in turn down all the house and build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14540)|
| 4:02:22| office because it kind of sticks into a neighborhood and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14542)|
| 4:02:24| that's actually you know in a neighborhood. It's at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14544)|
| 4:02:27| end of. Would bind there. So and I mean actually you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14547)|
| 4:02:33| could almost put the right neighborhood and mark everything that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14553)|
| 4:02:36| is the whole neighborhood is R. and two. And the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14556)|
| 4:02:40| only other changes you'd make in our neighborhood other than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14560)|
| 4:02:42| R. and two would be some instances that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14562)|
| 4:02:45| some of the pre existing. Small apartment buildings you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14565)|
| 4:02:49| if if they if if changing them from R. and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14569)|
| 4:02:52| two to something else would make them conforming. Did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14572)|
| 4:02:55| go along with that but to go in and pick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14575)|
| 4:02:58| out individual houses and upgrade them from you know R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14578)|
| 4:03:02| And from R. one A. to an R. two and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14582)|
| 4:03:06| more movement to an R. four still makes not conforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14586)|
| 4:03:10| Because a lot not big enough to be what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14590)|
| 4:03:12| are now and put our four on it still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14592)|
| 4:03:14| doesn't make them conforming. So Joe if we go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14594)|
| 4:03:20| to the school if we look at that where it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14600)|
| 4:03:23| an R. for now. What would be the with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14603)|
| 4:03:28| compromise be R. and three. They're at the school. R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14608)|
| 4:03:34| and three allows multifamily is attached. Only attached so they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14614)|
| 4:03:39| would be townhomes that would allow it also allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14619)|
| 4:03:42| single family homes and duplexes and attached or townhome development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14622)|
| 4:03:47| would not allow apartments. But it would allow multifamily in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14627)|
| 4:03:53| terms of the con our townhomes. So. I'm looking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14633)|
| 4:04:00| the neighborhood because I think in one of Lynn Sullivan's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14640)|
| 4:04:03| emails that she stated that she would be a me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14643)|
| 4:04:05| agreeable to an R. and three if if that were necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14645)|
| 4:04:10| so I'm going to recommend an R. and three. For| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14650)|
| 4:04:14| that for those rules for that for that property there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14654)|
| 4:04:17| at this at the school. I want to recommend for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14657)|
| 4:04:20| the seventeen hundred block of east fifth from our four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14660)|
| 4:04:23| to our two. Fourteen hundred block of woodbine. To our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14663)|
| 4:04:28| two. And then we have some specific addresses there in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14668)|
| 4:04:33| the email on East Fifth Avenue as well. To go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14673)|
| 4:04:36| from our four to our two. And I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14676)|
| 4:04:39| make a motion. So you have all those. Let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14679)|
| 4:04:47| send it to you know I'll get them I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14687)|
| 4:04:48| get them all. I'll get with you soon as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14688)|
| 4:04:50| have them. But we have them on the record. Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14690)|
| 4:04:57| so we have it on the record verbally we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14697)|
| 4:04:59| it and on the video. OK are there any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14699)|
| 4:05:06| or any more discussion on that that proposed zoning. Proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14706)|
| 4:05:10| amendment. No more. OK all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14710)|
| 4:05:16| Any opposed. That passes. OK. Unanimous. Hold on just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14716)|
| 4:05:22| so you have another one to bring up. OK. All| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14722)|
| 4:05:26| right. Go ahead. See council. Jamie Rowe. Forty two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14726)|
| 4:05:29| fifteen Tazewell Pike. Gerald Green and I talked about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14729)|
| 4:05:33| a long time ago. It's Claremont Clare Ridge and Cranberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14733)|
| 4:05:38| It's a great big area. But. All the lots there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14738)|
| 4:05:44| are owned either by the city or by my husband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14744)|
| 4:05:46| and me. We agreed that N.A. was the best zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14746)|
| 4:05:53| for it. But the floodway overlay is missing. It was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14753)|
| 4:05:59| there at one point and I don't know whether it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14759)|
| 4:06:02| back again or not. And I want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14762)|
| 4:06:05| that that floodway overlay is in place because that's where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14765)|
| 4:06:09| they bought Mr. Stairs familiar with this and so probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14769)|
| 4:06:13| Lauren. And Rob I know is. It's where they bought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14773)|
| 4:06:18| houses in the seventies when Mr. Roach was the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14778)|
| 4:06:21| director. They bought it because the house was flooded to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14781)|
| 4:06:25| the rooftops. It's not appropriate for anything. And we definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14785)|
| 4:06:31| need the floodway overlay and I just want to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14791)|
| 4:06:33| sure that that's there. OK. It's looking does that make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14793)|
| 4:06:39| sense. You have an address. I've got it pulled up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14799)|
| 4:06:42| it's that it's the whole shebang. If you go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14802)|
| 4:06:46| if somebody's pulling up council members are pulling up at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14806)|
| 4:06:49| forty two oh seven Claremont is one of the addresses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14809)|
| 4:06:52| are forty two oh eight Claremont Clare Ridge Cranberry it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14812)|
| 4:06:57| a big circle. Right. But if you put pop in one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14817)|
| 4:06:59| of those Claremont addresses which C.L.A. I.R. M.O.N.T. It will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14819)|
| 4:07:06| bring up that area which flooded in February due to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14826)|
| 4:07:09| the white high water table. And that's where I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14829)|
| 4:07:12| the constituents stuck in their home and Chief Sharp. Whenever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14832)|
| 4:07:16| Jamie's been your to get that we visited there during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14836)|
| 4:07:19| the flood. And that's not unusual. That's pretty common. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14839)|
| 4:07:29| Gerald what's going on with that. And I don't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14849)|
| 4:07:34| the floodway and I would like a motion that. You apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14854)|
| 4:07:41| the floodway zoning to this property. OK. As shown on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14861)|
| 4:07:46| the FEMA flood maps. OK. If there has been any change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14866)|
| 4:07:50| updating of the FEMA flood maps we'll make sure we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14870)|
| 4:07:52| the update. Will it stay in A with a flood white| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14872)|
| 4:07:56| overlay. It would be the floodway would just be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14876)|
| 4:07:58| overlay. Thank you. OK. So I'll make a motion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14878)|
| 4:08:02| the floodway corresponding with the FEMA maps be applied to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14882)|
| 4:08:08| the recode maps for Davron Clare Ridge cranberry gains and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14888)|
| 4:08:14| Claremont. OK. Any more discussion on that. We have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14894)|
| 4:08:22| motion. Second. Yet everything you need there Gerald. OK. All| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14902)|
| 4:08:28| in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed. That passes. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14908)|
| 4:08:31| Miss Rowe. OK. Anything else. Councilwoman Welch. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14911)|
| 4:08:38| mayor. Just maybe a clarification from Gerald about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14918)|
| 4:08:43| potential additional potential additions to the are in for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14923)|
| 4:08:49| zoning. So I know Miss Roland is here and I've spoken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14929)|
| 4:08:54| with her about continuing to work with neighborhoods in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14934)|
| 4:08:57| South Knoxville to identify potential sites for our and for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14937)|
| 4:09:01| so maybe just a little bit of public guidance about how that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14941)|
| 4:09:06| might work. And the staff would work with neighborhoods and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14946)|
| 4:09:09| can you back up one step and say that the are in for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14949)|
| 4:09:14| an hour and three provide good tools for small scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14954)|
| 4:09:18| multifamily scattered throughout the city. And as we've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14958)|
| 4:09:24| it's not something that's always me. It was met with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14964)|
| 4:09:30| enthusiasm and acceptance but they are tools in our toolbox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14970)|
| 4:09:35| now. I think the reference was made about a tool. Our tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14975)|
| 4:09:38| are early earlier that we have. So we would work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14978)|
| 4:09:41| neighborhoods with groups like the Miss Roland represents and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14981)|
| 4:09:46| others to identify spots. The property owner would have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14986)|
| 4:09:52| request a rezoning or the city council could could initiate a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14992)|
| 4:09:56| rezoning of those properties but they would have to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14996)|
| 4:09:59| the normal process for rezoning. And we're hoping that with some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=14999)|
| 4:10:05| opportunities that we have with the current zoning map for small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15005)|
| 4:10:09| scale multifamily that there'll be some good examples and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15009)|
| 4:10:13| concern about the impact of small scale multifamily on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15013)|
| 4:10:16| neighborhoods can be lessened because I think we've had we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15016)|
| 4:10:20| have some good examples of that and we have a lot of bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15020)|
| 4:10:23| examples of multifamily that may not be in the best location or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15023)|
| 4:10:28| the best design. And the are in for does have in our new zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15028)|
| 4:10:33| code all multifamily has some has basic design standards and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15033)|
| 4:10:38| they get an RN for anything more than four units building more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15038)|
| 4:10:42| than eight dwelling units total would be a special use and go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15042)|
| 4:10:46| before the Planning Commission for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15046)|
| 4:10:49| Thank you. Thank you. Councilwoman Ryder. I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15049)|
| 4:10:52| wanted to stay. I mean because we've we've had lots of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15052)|
| 4:10:55| meetings I've had lots of correspondence with Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15055)|
| 4:10:57| Green and Miss Roland. I think for folks in the course of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15057)|
| 4:11:02| process to see they feel more comfortable with neutral zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15062)|
| 4:11:06| because there isn't a project or proposal attached to it. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15066)|
| 4:11:09| when someone goes for a rezoning with identified properties and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15069)|
| 4:11:14| it's and there's something tangible like a proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15074)|
| 4:11:17| project it will be a different potentially different scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15077)|
| 4:11:22| Yes. And I think one of the good things about the are in for is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15082)|
| 4:11:25| that if it's more than again more than four units in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15085)|
| 4:11:28| building or eight units overall it's a special use of the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15088)|
| 4:11:32| come to the Planning Commission and a public public venue for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15092)|
| 4:11:35| review. And I think that puts a challenge before developers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15095)|
| 4:11:40| I look at Mr. Hill. I hope he takes advantage of that to do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15100)|
| 4:11:45| well-designed project that fits in with the community and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15105)|
| 4:11:48| that would result in more community acceptance of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15108)|
| 4:11:52| type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15112)|
| 4:11:55| Good. OK. Other discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15115)|
| 4:12:00| Any other comments from anyone. OK. So what we have Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15120)|
| 4:12:05| McKenzie just point of clarification. So if we vote and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15125)|
| 4:12:10| we approve the map today on second reading if we come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15130)|
| 4:12:15| with additional changes will that pushes back to first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15135)|
| 4:12:18| reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15138)|
| 4:12:26| And so let's talk about if you identified additional changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15146)|
| 4:12:32| and don't bring them up in second reading then it goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15152)|
| 4:12:37| through. Then when's the next opportunity to do it. And I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15157)|
| 4:12:41| look to Mr. Swanson for some direction here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15161)|
| 4:12:46| It would have to go through the Planning Commission and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15166)|
| 4:12:49| through this to the city council. The question I have for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15169)|
| 4:12:53| Mr. Swanson is could that be initiated before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15173)|
| 4:12:56| implementation date of the new zoning ordinance. Sure. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15176)|
| 4:13:00| That's what I thought. But I'd like to. I like when you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15180)|
| 4:13:02| 31. So if there are no amendments two weeks from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15182)|
| 4:13:12| then both the text and the map would pass on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15192)|
| 4:13:18| But we still have identified several actions we need to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15198)|
| 4:13:22| prior to implementation on the text. Right. And the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15202)|
| 4:13:28| process for any additional things that you find could start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15208)|
| 4:13:32| as well. And if it's neutral zoning there's no there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15212)|
| 4:13:37| fee. If the city council initiates it there's no fee. Oh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15217)|
| 4:13:40| if city council initiates it's no fee there. OK. Good reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15220)|
| 4:13:44| So that's a great point of clarification. So if we pass the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15224)|
| 4:13:48| map tonight second reading there are some addition one or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15228)|
| 4:13:53| things that come up. We could still pass and then council the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15233)|
| 4:13:57| council member could then bring it to MPC. That's correct. To| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15237)|
| 4:14:02| have it for no fee. It comes quickly. We could probably have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15242)|
| 4:14:07| that change on the map before the effective date of the of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15247)|
| 4:14:12| new code. What would what would be that window of time for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15252)|
| 4:14:16| to be able to do that. Have to get to. By the end of next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15256)|
| 4:14:23| month we of August we'd need the changes so we could get them on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15263)|
| 4:14:26| the. Let me make sure I have this right. No. Maybe even in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15266)|
| 4:14:31| September if we could get to that planning commission in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15271)|
| 4:14:34| November and city council in December. Could and could you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15274)|
| 4:14:39| maybe get our work out of dates and then send them to be honest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15279)|
| 4:14:42| I'm not thinking as well at this late hours. So you will send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15282)|
| 4:14:46| that what the drop dead dates are. Yes ma'am. OK. And it's any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15286)|
| 4:14:51| person or entity aggrieved by any changes can make the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15291)|
| 4:14:56| So it's not just council. Right. Well to a neutral to zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15296)|
| 4:15:03| neutral. Right. Right. No charge if it's not neutral then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15303)|
| 4:15:09| there is a charge. But for council there's no charge either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15309)|
| 4:15:13| way. Right. Right. Right. OK. Mr. Frost. Thank you mayor. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15313)|
| 4:15:18| Mr. Green. I'll probably start hearing from my clients about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15318)|
| 4:15:24| we'd like MPC to look at Willow Street or Spruce Street or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15324)|
| 4:15:28| something like that. Would a resolution that just listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15328)|
| 4:15:34| individually each of the requested street addresses for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15334)|
| 4:15:40| you all to look at suffice for your purposes. We don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15340)|
| 4:15:46| work with the city likely the city recorder to get an official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15346)|
| 4:15:50| application from the city. So our processes and procedures are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15350)|
| 4:15:55| are here here too. But that list would certainly initiate it get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15355)|
| 4:15:58| the ball rolling. Yes sir. Thank you. So in other words if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15358)|
| 4:16:02| council members have some more give them to Mr. Frost and get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15362)|
| 4:16:05| the ball rolling on it. OK. And that's good. Any anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15365)|
| 4:16:10| So what we need is a motion to approve the zoning map as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15370)|
| 4:16:16| amended on first reading. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15376)|
| 4:16:23| opposed. No. One no. One no. Passes 8 to 1. Thank you. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15383)|
| 4:16:30| you. Oh Miss Roach. Come on. When the next meetings are if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15390)|
| 4:16:34| you're using council meetings or the special dates you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15394)|
| 4:16:36| reserved. Thank you. Yes. So we won't meet on the 5th or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15396)|
| 4:16:40| 12th because we can't take a vote on second reading. You need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15400)|
| 4:16:46| two weeks. OK. So no meeting on the 5th. I don't know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15406)|
| 4:16:50| you're going to do with your time. The 5th and the 12th. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15410)|
| 4:16:53| we will be meeting here on what's the 13th Tuesday 13th 6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=15413)|
