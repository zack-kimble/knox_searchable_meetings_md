| 0:01:12| All right. You have all received a copy of your minutes from last meeting. Do I have a motion to approve those minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=72)|
| 0:01:20| Motion to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=80)|
| 0:01:23| I hear a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=83)|
| 0:01:26| So, Mr. Johnson, please. Well, is there any discussion about the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=86)|
| 0:01:31| No? Okay. Then, Mr. Johnson, please call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=91)|

| 0:01:40| Councilwoman Parker? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=100)|
| 0:01:44| Councilwoman Ryder? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| Councilman DiBerto? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=107)|
| 0:01:50| Councilwoman Singh? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=110)|
| 0:01:53| Councilman Smith? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=113)|
| 0:01:56| Councilman Testerman? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=116)|
| 0:01:59| Councilman Thomas? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=119)|
| 0:02:02| And Councilwoman Fugate? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=122)|
| 0:02:07| All right. Very good. The minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=127)|
| 0:02:11| So, before we get started, I'm going to have a few announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=131)|
| 0:02:15| We have 10 beer applications before us tonight, as well as one addendum on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=135)|
| 0:02:21| You can see, obviously, we're having our meeting by Zoom, just like we did back in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=141)|
| 0:02:26| And so that means things are a little different than you're used to if you're joining us in the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| When I call the names of businesses applying for their permit, please raise your hand in Zoom in the Zoom session to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=151)|
| 0:02:37| You can do that by dialing star 9 on your phone or star 6 to unmute yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=157)|
| 0:02:43| When you're called upon, please state your name and address clearly for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| Applicants who are approved pending final documentation will need to bring their completed documents to the business tax office during regular business hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=168)|
| 0:02:56| Applicants that have their permits approved tonight can pick up their permits after the meeting, which will probably be next the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=176)|
| 0:03:03| As I'm chairing the meeting, other members will be making motions on behalf of the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=183)|
| 0:03:09| Because our meeting is held by Zoom, each agenda item will be voted on by a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=189)|
| 0:03:18| Item 4D has been withdrawn, so no action is needed on that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=198)|
| 0:03:25| Also, items 4A, 4B, 4C, 4F, and 4G have requested to be heard at the July 28th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=205)|
| 0:03:34| Mr. Byrd, can you confirm that those items 4A, 4B, 4C, 4F, and 4G have all requested to be heard in July?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=214)|
| 0:03:44| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=224)|
| 0:03:46| So hearing that, I'd like to group all those together and move them to the July agenda if there's a motion to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=226)|
| 0:03:56| Motion to postpone those items until the July meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| Any discussion about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| This is very similar to something we did before to group similar items so we can move to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=244)|
| 0:04:10| Okay, so hearing no discussion, Mr. Johnson, please call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=250)|
| 0:04:17| Council Member McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| Council Member Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=260)|

| 0:04:27| Council Member Berto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| Council Member Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| Council Member Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| Council Member Testerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| Council Member Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| Council Member Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| All right, so all the 4A, 4B, 4C, 4F, and 4G are all moved to the July meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=290)|
| 0:04:58| Mr. Johnson, what do we have next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| I think it's 4E that I just wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=300)|
| 0:05:06| You said earlier 4D was withdrawn, so yes, 4E, Lucky Shot Billiards, Sports Bar, and Grill would be our next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=306)|
| 0:05:14| Okay, are they present with us today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| Kenneth Harris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| Yes, Mr. Harris is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=322)|
| 0:05:26| Mr. Harris, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=328)|
| 0:05:29| Okay, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| All right, so what I'm going to do now is ask for what is in your application, what is not, so we can move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=331)|
| 0:05:41| Sergeant Coward, are you here? Can you tell us about the background check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| Yes, I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=345)|
| 0:05:53| Can you tell us about 4E's background check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| We are missing their fingerprints and background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| So it's a long-standing policy of this board to not approve even pending final documentation when we don't have completed background checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=362)|
| 0:06:14| Mr. Harris, would you like to postpone until July so you can get that completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=374)|
| 0:06:20| I have my background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| Mr. Harris, you have to do your background check through us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| I did it through Knoxville City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| Not according to my record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| I've done it on the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| I went down several times when the computers were down, and they've done it on the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| Well, I have the documents where it was done, and it was done at the city-county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=405)|
| 0:06:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| City-county building is not where you get your fingerprints and background check done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| So you've come to the wrong location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| You'll need to contact my office to schedule that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=423)|
| 0:07:10| Mr. Harris, we can postpone you until the July 28th meeting, and then that gives you time to get that completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=430)|
| 0:07:16| and I can make sure that somebody gets in touch with you to help you through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| Would that be okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| Is there no way that I can go down tomorrow and send this to you guys or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| That would require something that the board has not traditionally done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=452)|
| 0:07:38| It's a very longstanding policy that we don't approve any final documentation on background checks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=458)|
| 0:07:44| so it's not something that I'd be comfortable with doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| but I can make sure that somebody gets in touch with you so that you're ready to go at the July meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=467)|
| 0:07:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=476)|
| 0:07:57| Hearing that, do I have a motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| Motion to postpone 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| Okay. I heard Mr. Smith with a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| So we're going to move this to the July 28th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| Hearing none, Mr. Johnson, call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=496)|

| 0:11:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| Do we have somebody here with us from iSpeakeasy Sports and Grill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| Sergeant Coward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| They have no applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| However, they are missing their task requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| Mr. Byrd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| We still need the approval from the Health Department as well as a surrender of the prior permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=731)|
| 0:12:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| And Mr. Frost, we have a longstanding policy of not moving forward on these when we don't have the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=741)|
| 0:12:31| But when there's a background check has been completed, but the task class has not been attended, that is a situation where we can move forward pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=751)|
| 0:12:42| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| The task class is given on a regular basis, and it's very easy to determine whether or not it's been taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=765)|
| 0:12:54| So it's easily and clearly determinable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=774)|
| 0:13:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| I just wanted to clarify that so we could move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| Who do we have with us from iSpeakeasy Sports and Grill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| We have Mr. Patterson, but he is using an old version of Zoom, and I've had to promote him to be a panelist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=789)|
| 0:13:19| I don't know that he can speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| Mr. Patterson, can you hear us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=804)|
| 0:13:30| I can ask him to start his video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| I prefer not to, but I don't know how else to help him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=813)|
| 0:13:41| Well, I think we've got information that he's done his background check, but he's missing the task class and he's got some outstanding approvals still needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=821)|
| 0:13:52| We've got him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=832)|

| 0:14:00| He's obviously here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=840)|
| 0:14:06| Well, given that we've got the completed background check, and I think this one's probably okay to do pending final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=846)|
| 0:14:15| do you see any reason that we wouldn't be able to do that, Mr. Cross?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=855)|
| 0:14:21| I do not, Terry. I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| Okay. We're just not going to be able to hear from Mr. Patterson about the iSpeakeasy Sports Grill, which is disappointing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=864)|
| 0:14:33| I spoke with him earlier this week, and he's aware of the outstanding items and knows what to do to get them done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200616?start=873)|
