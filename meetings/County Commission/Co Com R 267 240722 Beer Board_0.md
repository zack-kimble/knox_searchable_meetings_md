| 0:03:18| Hang on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=198)|

| 0:03:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| On 6-24-24 at approximately 16-14 hours, detectives conducted an underage beer buy at Easy Stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=211)|
| 0:03:39| at 7323 Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| The defendants did not ask for an ID, just asked for a date of birth and sold a 24-ounce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=221)|
| 0:03:48| Coors light to an underage person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=228)|
| 0:03:51| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| Now you can tell us what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| Hello, Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| We did fail this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| The cashier that was working for us had worked for us for only three days and had been through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| some training, but she had worked for a competitor for quite some time in a capacity and thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=245)|
| 0:04:13| she recognized the individual from her prior work, and he was over the age of 21 and didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=253)|
| 0:04:20| ask for the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| So that's at least what we were told by the cashier that was cited at this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=261)|
| 0:04:28| She has since got a deferment for her penalty, and she takes the ABC course again, then she'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=268)|
| 0:04:39| get her record expunged, assuming she stays clean for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| We went ahead and terminated her, given the conviction, and so that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=285)|
| 0:04:53| I just want to tell you a little bit about our policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| This is Brian Cosentino, who's our general manager with Easy Stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| We'd had more folks here, but we had a cashier that was hit by a truck and knocked down on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=299)|
| 0:05:05| a driveway, and they're taking care of her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| She's on the way to the emergency room at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| Thankfully, we think okay, other than scrapes and bruises and scared to death, but we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| all Santa blessings today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| Apologize again for not getting the memo to wear orange, too, for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=320)|
| 0:05:25| We take our privilege license to sell beer seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| We have 25 stores in 10 East East Cine Counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| Raised my family here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| All my daughters went through UT, some of them twice, and got grandsons and granddaughters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=334)|
| 0:05:41| coming up in the communities that we live in, so we do take that seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=341)|
| 0:05:46| Our employees are trained through a remote training process that our staff and managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=346)|
| 0:05:53| monitor where they have to watch videos and are tested, and then we check them monthly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=353)|
| 0:06:02| with a third-party beer sting, and this is a copy of a sting that we've done at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=362)|
| 0:06:13| location, and we've passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| Unfortunately, this location failed a year ago with a young man who mistook the ID and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=377)|
| 0:06:25| typed it incorrectly, so this is our second offense inside a year, but we've been checking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=385)|
| 0:06:31| up with the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| Again, this is an older individual that I would have thought would have done better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| but didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| Do we have any questions from commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=399)|
| 0:06:47| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| Sir, it sounds like you do, but do you accept or deny the charges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| Do what, Carson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| Do you accept or deny the charge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=414)|
| 0:06:58| We accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=418)|
| 0:06:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| Just want to get it on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| I don't think that was asked, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| Do you have the electronic readers at the cash registers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| Do they use them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| They do, but if the cashiers think they know the individual and have seen them before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| then they may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| A cashier, as a matter of practice, would not ask for the license if they know them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=443)|
| 0:07:32| and know they're over the age of 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| In this case, that's what the cashier thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=455)|
| 0:07:41| Okay, but they do ask if they do not recognize the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| If they have any questions, we ultimately ask to scan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| There is pushback from the community to hand an ID over for individuals handed over to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=466)|
| 0:07:53| our cashiers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| I scan it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| They're saying that, oh, you're keeping my vital records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| We're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| All we see on our transaction is above age or the date of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=478)|

| 0:08:07| But there is some hesitance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| So as a matter of, I guess, practice for cashiers, that's what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=489)|
| 0:08:15| If they know the person was above age, then they won't check it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| Even if you have the pink stripe ID, which shows you're under 21, if you're past the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=500)|

| 0:08:40| So we try to make it a mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| We make it a mandate, but as far as a matter of practice, I can't get all the cashiers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| to get asked for an ID every time when they see the person three or four times a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=528)|

| 0:10:55| I have a question for the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| I just looked it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| Correct me if I'm wrong, but by looking this up, you have to ask for a license every time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| you sell beer for off-premise, but on-premise, you don't have to ask for an ID every time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=663)|
| 0:11:08| but for off-premise use, you always have to ask for an ID according to the law that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| I just looked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| Am I correct or incorrect, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| We're supposed to verify the age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| I'm asking the officer, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| Yeah, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| Also, I'm not sure what birthday they're putting in if they recognize them as somebody that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=679)|
| 0:11:25| being over 21 because you're supposed to put that person's birthday in there, so I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| For the record, it is the law that every time you sell an alcoholic beverage for off-premise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| use, you have to ID the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| There is no exception to that whether you know the person or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| And we were the ones that helped push that to get that law verified so our cashiers wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| be abused when asking for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| They shouldn't be allowed to put it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| They should have to scan it every single time would be the proper way to handle this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| And we check to make sure that they're using different dates and not one date consistently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=713)|
| 0:12:00| on the shelf and go back and follow up with those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722-beer-board?start=720)|
