| 2:07:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7646)|
| 2:07:27| Nor does mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7647)|
| 2:07:29| But the daily schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7649)|
| 2:07:31| that they submit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7651)|
| 2:07:32| which would be part of the use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7652)|
| 2:07:34| on review approval or denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7654)|
| 2:07:36| or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7656)|
| 2:07:37| shows the van taking them out every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7657)|
| 2:07:40| and bringing them back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7660)|
| 2:07:41| Isn't that a part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7661)|
| 2:07:43| what they're proposing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7663)|
| 2:07:58| Wouldn't their daily schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7678)|
| 2:08:00| be a part of the definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7680)|
| 2:08:02| of the use they're requesting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7682)|
| 2:08:07| Yes, I think the schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7687)|
| 2:08:10| that they are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7690)|
| 2:08:12| submitting is what is expected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7692)|
| 2:08:15| is going to happen on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7695)|
| 2:08:20| You know, we are recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7700)|
| 2:08:21| denial of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7701)|
| 2:08:23| so I will say that the staff report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7703)|
| 2:08:26| is primarily written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| through the lens of a denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7708)|
| 2:08:31| because that's the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7711)|
| 2:08:33| stance that we are taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7713)|
| 2:08:41| Mike, do you have something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7721)|
| 2:08:42| you wanted to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7722)|
| 2:08:48| Yes, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7728)|
| 2:08:48| I was going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7728)|
| 2:08:49| I think it's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7729)|
| 2:08:50| I think it's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7730)|
| 2:08:51| I think it's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7731)|
| 2:08:52| Yes, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7732)|
| 2:08:53| I was muted there for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7733)|
| 2:08:55| I just wanted to quickly clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7735)|
| 2:08:56| I misspoke earlier when I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7736)|
| 2:08:58| that the former staff report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7738)|
| 2:08:59| for the assisted living facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7739)|
| 2:09:01| was required a 20 foot paved surface| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7741)|
| 2:09:03| on Zion line down to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7743)|
| 2:09:06| What it was saying was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7746)|
| 2:09:07| it needed a 20 foot paved surface| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7747)|
| 2:09:10| around the right side of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7750)|
| 2:09:12| which is sort of their part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7752)|
| 2:09:14| of the existing gravel driveway system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7754)|
| 2:09:16| that they're proposing to pave to 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7756)|
| 2:09:19| So I just wanted to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7759)|
| 2:09:21| that I misspoke in regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7761)|
| 2:09:23| to the requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7763)|
| 2:09:24| the previous requirement of widening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7764)|
| 2:09:25| to Zion line to 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7765)|
| 2:09:28| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7768)|
| 2:09:29| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7769)|
| 2:09:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7771)|
| 2:09:33| Hence, I want to interject something here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7773)|
| 2:09:36| This building has been a group home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7776)|
| 2:09:39| apparently already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| What sounds like to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7781)|
| 2:09:43| was both older folks and younger folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7783)|
| 2:09:49| If this building is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7789)|
| 2:09:51| if this use is not appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7791)|
| 2:09:53| I would wonder what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7793)|
| 2:09:56| where it would be appropriate to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7796)|
| 2:10:01| I don't really see the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7801)|
| 2:10:03| I don't really see the problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| And I don't know what else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7805)|
| 2:10:06| what other use this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7806)|
| 2:10:07| would be good for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7807)|
| 2:10:09| If not that, I don't know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7809)|
| 2:10:13| I don't know if it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7813)|
| 2:10:14| a sound to me like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7814)|
| 2:10:16| it's not going to be a drug rehab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7816)|
| 2:10:17| I don't know that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| If it is, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7819)|
| 2:10:23| listening to our statistics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7823)|
| 2:10:26| that we have and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7826)|
| 2:10:28| and the lack of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7828)|
| 2:10:31| lack of that type of facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7831)|
| 2:10:33| in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7833)|
| 2:10:37| I mean, I hate to say it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7837)|
| 2:10:39| but I mean, nobody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| everybody thinks we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7841)|
| 2:10:42| And we do need those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7842)|
| 2:10:44| But nobody wants it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7844)|
| 2:10:45| anywhere close to where they live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| And I submit that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7847)|
| 2:10:48| there's not anywhere in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7848)|
| 2:10:50| that somebody wouldn't complain about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7850)|
| 2:10:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7853)|
| 2:10:54| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7854)|
| 2:10:57| Any other questions or comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7857)|
| 2:10:58| about this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7858)|
| 2:11:02| Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7862)|
| 2:11:04| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7864)|
| 2:11:05| Just really quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7865)|
| 2:11:06| I wanted to agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7866)|
| 2:11:07| Commissioner Roth and what he just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7867)|
| 2:11:10| And as submitted right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7870)|
| 2:11:12| you know, it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7872)|
| 2:11:14| a drug rehabilitation center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7874)|
| 2:11:16| And this is a use on a review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7876)|
| 2:11:18| So my interpretation would be that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7878)|
| 2:11:21| if at any point in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7881)|
| 2:11:22| they wanted to offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7882)|
| 2:11:24| drug rehabilitation services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7884)|
| 2:11:26| they would have to go for an approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7886)|
| 2:11:28| for a change in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7888)|
| 2:11:30| So someone would be made aware of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7890)|
| 2:11:32| prior to it happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7892)|
| 2:11:33| Is that is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7893)|
| 2:11:36| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7896)|
| 2:11:37| If they were to change the use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7897)|
| 2:11:38| they would have to come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7898)|
| 2:11:40| Yes. OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7902)|
| 2:11:45| OK, we're ready to move on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7905)|
| 2:11:46| and we actually have two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7906)|
| 2:11:47| more agenda items to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7907)|
| 2:11:51| So number 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7911)|
| 2:11:54| This is 11B-20-OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7914)|
| 2:11:56| We postponed this last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7916)|
| 2:12:00| So the intent of this proposed change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7920)|
| 2:12:02| is to ensure really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7922)|
| 2:12:04| to the greatest extent possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7924)|
| 2:12:06| that comments are concise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7926)|
| 2:12:08| they're relevant to the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7928)|
| 2:12:09| before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7929)|
| 2:12:10| And most importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7930)|
| 2:12:11| I think that the recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7931)|
| 2:12:13| order of discussion aligns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7933)|
| 2:12:14| with that set forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7934)|
| 2:12:15| by Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7935)|
| 2:12:17| and Knoxville City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7937)|
| 2:12:19| I think that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7939)|
| 2:12:21| as much as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7941)|
| 2:12:23| if we can align our process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7943)|
| 2:12:24| and procedure with our local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7944)|
| 2:12:28| legislative bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7948)|
| 2:12:30| that it makes a lot of sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7950)|
| 2:12:31| and it makes it easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7951)|
| 2:12:31| for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7951)|
| 2:12:32| So really, the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7952)|
| 2:12:33| is to streamline discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7953)|
| 2:12:34| debate on items while continuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7954)|
| 2:12:36| to allow consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7956)|
| 2:12:38| all views, which you all do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7958)|
| 2:12:40| and allow people to provide comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7960)|
| 2:12:42| on each matter of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7962)|
| 2:12:44| So applicants would provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7964)|
| 2:12:45| comments first is the recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7965)|
| 2:12:47| followed by proponents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7967)|
| 2:12:49| Then opponents and commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7969)|
| 2:12:50| can grant time for rebuttal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7970)|
| 2:12:52| for anyone speaking on an item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7972)|
| 2:12:54| An applicant could also reserve time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7974)|
| 2:12:56| to rebut any oppositional points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7976)|
| 2:12:58| as well as if you all wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7978)|
| 2:13:02| even add additional time to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7982)|
| 2:13:04| as part of your bylaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7984)|
| 2:13:08| So I'd be interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7988)|
| 2:13:08| if you all have any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7988)|
| 2:13:09| or comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7989)|
| 2:13:16| Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7996)|
| 2:13:18| OK, yeah, I feel kind of strongly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7998)|
| 2:13:20| about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8000)|
| 2:13:21| Now, when you have an applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8001)|
| 2:13:24| pays a fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8004)|
| 2:13:26| wants to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8006)|
| 2:13:27| with their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8007)|
| 2:13:29| and you have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8009)|
| 2:13:31| And to me, the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8011)|
| 2:13:33| should have the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8013)|
| 2:13:36| to hear the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8016)|
| 2:13:38| so that he can, in turn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8018)|
| 2:13:40| answer those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8020)|
| 2:13:43| I think it's going to waste more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8023)|
| 2:13:45| if you have the applicant come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8025)|
| 2:13:47| and speak to a broad amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8027)|
| 2:13:49| of a bunch of issues that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8029)|
| 2:13:51| he doesn't even know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8031)|
| 2:13:53| what the opposition is concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| Then the opposition speaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8035)|
| 2:13:56| Then the applicant has to go up again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8036)|
| 2:14:00| to address the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8040)|
| 2:14:01| of the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8041)|
| 2:14:02| So I don't I strongly feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8042)|
| 2:14:05| we need to leave this the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8045)|
| 2:14:07| I feel like it works well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8047)|
| 2:14:09| The applicant can ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8049)|
| 2:14:14| the opposition to go first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8054)|
| 2:14:15| which most of them do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| to hear what their concerns are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8057)|
| 2:14:18| Then he can get up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8058)|
| 2:14:19| or she can get up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8059)|
| 2:14:20| and address those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8060)|
| 2:14:24| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8064)|
| 2:14:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8066)|
| 2:14:28| Could you, you went through quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8068)|
| 2:14:30| like here is how the process would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8070)|
| 2:14:32| Could you do that one more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8072)|
| 2:14:33| but a little bit slower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8073)|
| 2:14:35| The applicants first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8075)|
| 2:14:37| opposition second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8077)|
| 2:14:39| and then I lost you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8079)|
| 2:14:41| And the applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8081)|
| 2:14:43| so the applicant would go first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8083)|
| 2:14:46| to give everyone an overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8086)|
| 2:14:48| of what they're proposing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8088)|
| 2:14:51| and any other context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8091)|
| 2:14:53| that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8093)|
| 2:14:54| And that would be followed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8094)|
| 2:14:55| anybody in support of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8095)|
| 2:14:58| And then it would go over to opponents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8098)|
| 2:15:00| anybody who had any type of opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8100)|
| 2:15:03| to that particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8103)|
| 2:15:08| You said something after that though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8108)|
| 2:15:09| And then the commission could grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8109)|
| 2:15:11| time for rebuttal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8111)|
| 2:15:12| for anyone speaking on item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8112)|
| 2:15:14| which you all do that now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8114)|
| 2:15:16| and can continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8116)|
| 2:15:18| And the applicant can also reserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8118)|
| 2:15:20| any portion of their time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8120)|
| 2:15:22| which applicants and opponents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8122)|
| 2:15:24| currently are able to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8124)|
| 2:15:25| to rebut any points that are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8125)|
| 2:15:29| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8129)|
| 2:15:33| Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8133)|
| 2:15:40| Oh, you're muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8140)|
| 2:15:42| I can't even see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8142)|
| 2:15:43| Unmute, Sandra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8143)|
| 2:15:46| Okay, I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8146)|
| 2:15:48| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8148)|
| 2:15:51| I have a couple points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8151)|
| 2:15:53| I worked closely with communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8153)|
| 2:15:56| and there have been complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8156)|
| 2:15:59| among the public here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8159)|
| 2:16:00| in Knoxville, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8160)|
| 2:16:03| that the current system is very unfair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8163)|
| 2:16:06| for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8166)|
| 2:16:09| One is that if you are a proponent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8169)|
| 2:16:14| you still have to take the public time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8174)|
| 2:16:18| to speak in favor of something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8178)|
| 2:16:20| And so I'm sure people would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8180)|
| 2:16:23| to have that spread out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8183)|
| 2:16:24| so that if there's any public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8184)|
| 2:16:26| that wants to speak in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8186)|
| 2:16:27| of an application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8187)|
| 2:16:29| they would be considered as the proponent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8189)|
| 2:16:31| with a separate time slot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8191)|
| 2:16:34| which this proposal guarantees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8194)|
| 2:16:37| The second is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8197)|
| 2:16:42| I've just never in my experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8202)|
| 2:16:44| seen a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8204)|
| 2:16:45| where the applicant speaks last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8205)|
| 2:16:48| Typically, you have the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8208)|
| 2:16:51| which staff is recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8211)|
| 2:16:53| and which is followed by Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8213)|
| 2:16:55| and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8215)|
| 2:16:57| The same sequence of events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8217)|
| 2:16:59| an applicant with any sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8219)|
| 2:17:02| will take some of their time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8222)|
| 2:17:04| and set it aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8224)|
| 2:17:05| so that they can still be the last speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8225)|
| 2:17:09| But many of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8229)|
| 2:17:12| don't fully understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8232)|
| 2:17:13| what is being proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8233)|
| 2:17:15| and it gives the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8235)|
| 2:17:16| and the entire commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8236)|
| 2:17:18| a chance to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8238)|
| 2:17:20| with the same understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8240)|
| 2:17:22| of what is being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8242)|
| 2:17:24| Example would be this Edward Place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8244)|
| 2:17:26| where everybody's saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8246)|
| 2:17:27| oh, it's rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8247)|
| 2:17:29| oh, it's this, it's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8249)|
| 2:17:30| If the applicant could speak first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8250)|
| 2:17:33| and explain it all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8253)|
| 2:17:34| it might reduce the amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8254)|
| 2:17:37| it takes for the public to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8257)|
| 2:17:39| So I myself very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8259)|
| 2:17:42| would like to align our system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8262)|
| 2:17:44| with the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8264)|
| 2:17:45| that our elected officials use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| If they can spare the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8267)|
| 2:17:49| I think we can too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8269)|
| 2:17:51| Thank you, Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8271)|
| 2:17:54| Any other questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8274)|
| 2:17:55| or comments about this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8275)|
| 2:18:01| I will say that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8281)|
| 2:18:03| I appreciate Commissioner Scott-Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8283)|
| 2:18:05| your comments about the fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8285)|
| 2:18:07| I just, I just want to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8287)|
| 2:18:08| like, so the applicants do pay a fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8288)|
| 2:18:11| but they do, those fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8291)|
| 2:18:12| go to a number of different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8292)|
| 2:18:14| as you all know, orders of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8294)|
| 2:18:16| So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8296)|
| 2:18:18| orders of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8298)|
| 2:18:19| So we have to advertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8299)|
| 2:18:22| that costs quite a bit of resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8302)|
| 2:18:25| And then we also work pretty closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8305)|
| 2:18:28| with all these applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8308)|
| 2:18:30| to help them move through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8310)|
| 2:18:32| as well as, as you all saw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8312)|
| 2:18:34| the number of comments that come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8314)|
| 2:18:35| So those fees are utilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8315)|
| 2:18:37| to help shepherd that request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8317)|
| 2:18:40| through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8320)|
| 2:18:41| in addition to making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8321)|
| 2:18:43| that everyone has ample time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8323)|
| 2:18:44| to provide their input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| into that application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8326)|
| 2:18:48| Yeah, I would also say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8328)|
| 2:18:50| you know, a lot of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8330)|
| 2:18:51| the applicant can go first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8331)|
| 2:18:53| you know, we ask them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8333)|
| 2:18:55| if they want to, they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8335)|
| 2:18:57| And, you know, sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8337)|
| 2:19:00| you're going to go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8340)|
| 2:19:00| I mean, how many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8340)|
| 2:19:01| have we seen this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8341)|
| 2:19:03| There happens to be no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8343)|
| 2:19:05| And so we have an applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8345)|
| 2:19:06| that spends four or five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8346)|
| 2:19:09| making a presentation and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8349)|
| 2:19:11| you know, nobody's there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8351)|
| 2:19:12| to really rebut it, which is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8352)|
| 2:19:14| But I just feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8354)|
| 2:19:16| a better use of our time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8356)|
| 2:19:17| would be to allow the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8357)|
| 2:19:19| the courtesy of allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8359)|
| 2:19:21| the opposition to go first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8361)|
| 2:19:23| responding to those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8363)|
| 2:19:25| And I think we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8365)|
| 2:19:26| a more concise, informative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8366)|
| 2:19:28| presentation that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8368)|
| 2:19:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8369)|
| 2:19:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8370)|
| 2:19:31| We have a couple more hands up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8371)|
| 2:19:32| Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8372)|
| 2:19:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8376)|
| 2:19:37| I agree with Commissioner Korbelik| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8377)|
| 2:19:40| and Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8380)|
| 2:19:42| maybe for the same reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8382)|
| 2:19:44| So I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8384)|
| 2:19:45| because an applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8385)|
| 2:19:46| is spending the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8386)|
| 2:19:47| and taking the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8387)|
| 2:19:48| to propose something that actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8388)|
| 2:19:52| you know, it's their right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8392)|
| 2:19:54| to be able to present the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8394)|
| 2:19:56| in its entirety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8396)|
| 2:19:58| so that there's no confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8398)|
| 2:20:01| I don't know if the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8401)|
| 2:20:03| or applicants see the same comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8403)|
| 2:20:05| that we can, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8405)|
| 2:20:07| coming in online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8407)|
| 2:20:09| But, you know, if they are looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8409)|
| 2:20:12| at that ahead of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8412)|
| 2:20:13| then they're able to kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8413)|
| 2:20:14| come better prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8414)|
| 2:20:15| to go ahead and already have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| answers to those questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8417)|
| 2:20:18| you know, rather than receiving them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8418)|
| 2:20:21| right off the bat in that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8421)|
| 2:20:22| So like in the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8422)|
| 2:20:23| of the Woodbury crossing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8423)|
| 2:20:25| you know, is it rental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8425)|
| 2:20:26| Is it this? Is it that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8426)|
| 2:20:27| If they're seeing those comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| and questions ahead of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8429)|
| 2:20:31| then being able to go first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8431)|
| 2:20:33| and state for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8433)|
| 2:20:34| what their stance is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8434)|
| 2:20:35| what they're presenting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8435)|
| 2:20:37| I think would ultimately cut down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8437)|
| 2:20:39| on time spent with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8439)|
| 2:20:41| you know, opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8441)|
| 2:20:43| Same with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8443)|
| 2:20:45| this case just now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8445)|
| 2:20:46| with the rehabilitation center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8446)|
| 2:20:48| which is a boarding house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8448)|
| 2:20:49| A lot of people said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8449)|
| 2:20:50| it was a rehab center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8450)|
| 2:20:52| They were able to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8452)|
| 2:20:54| but if they were able to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8454)|
| 2:20:55| that right off the bat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8455)|
| 2:20:55| then maybe it wouldn't be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8455)|
| 2:20:57| you know, five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8457)|
| 2:20:58| seven minutes, eight minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8458)|
| 2:20:59| added to opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8459)|
| 2:21:01| you know, if they could just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8461)|
| 2:21:02| say it right off the bat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8462)|
| 2:21:03| So I think that actually helps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8463)|
| 2:21:06| the applicant to just be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8466)|
| 2:21:07| able to state their case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8467)|
| 2:21:11| Thank you, Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8471)|
| 2:21:13| Michelle, did you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8473)|
| 2:21:14| your hand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8474)|
| 2:21:14| Did you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8474)|
| 2:21:19| Yeah, I was kind of waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8479)|
| 2:21:20| I'm trying, I was trying to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8480)|
| 2:21:21| till the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8481)|
| 2:21:22| No one had their hand up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8482)|
| 2:21:23| when I raised mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8483)|
| 2:21:23| but so I'll let you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8483)|
| 2:21:25| finish this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8485)|
| 2:21:26| And I just wanted to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8486)|
| 2:21:28| the right away closures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8488)|
| 2:21:28| and the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8488)|
| 2:21:30| Okay, let's hold off for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8490)|
| 2:21:34| So any other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8494)|
| 2:21:36| I don't see any other hands raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8496)|
| 2:21:39| We do have another agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8499)|
| 2:21:41| that I added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8501)|
| 2:21:43| So to discuss virtual meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8503)|
| 2:21:46| and the future of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8506)|
| 2:21:48| And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8508)|
| 2:21:48| one of the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8508)|
| 2:21:50| that we've been official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8510)|
| 2:21:51| to get answered from you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8511)|
| 2:21:53| are there any certain benchmarks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8513)|
| 2:21:55| that we can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8515)|
| 2:21:56| sort of on the lookout for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8516)|
| 2:21:59| You know, as we move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8519)|
| 2:22:02| over the next couple of months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8522)|
| 2:22:03| that would make you all comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8523)|
| 2:22:05| with meeting in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8525)|
| 2:22:06| Or the other question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8526)|
| 2:22:08| we can just convene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8528)|
| 2:22:10| the executive board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8530)|
| 2:22:11| and have that discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8531)|
| 2:22:13| decision made at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8533)|
| 2:22:17| There's a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8537)|
| 2:22:18| of uncharted territory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8538)|
| 2:22:20| Guidance is appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8540)|
| 2:22:23| Amy, can you go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8543)|
| 2:22:24| over the again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8544)|
| 2:22:25| specifically what you're already asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8545)|
| 2:22:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8547)|
| 2:22:28| So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8548)|
| 2:22:29| we were supposed to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8549)|
| 2:22:29| in person this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8549)|
| 2:22:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8551)|
| 2:22:32| But given sort of the rising rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8552)|
| 2:22:34| of COVID in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8554)|
| 2:22:35| the community spread,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8555)|
| 2:22:36| the decision was made to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8556)|
| 2:22:39| you know, after consulting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8559)|
| 2:22:40| with all of you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8560)|
| 2:22:41| to remain virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8561)|
| 2:22:43| So at what point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8563)|
| 2:22:44| you know, next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8564)|
| 2:22:46| it's just it's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8566)|
| 2:22:47| You know, we can keep doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8567)|
| 2:22:48| sort of ad hoc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8568)|
| 2:22:50| And but do we want to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8570)|
| 2:22:53| until rates start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8573)|
| 2:22:55| dropping to a certain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8575)|
| 2:22:56| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8576)|
| 2:22:57| this was a discussion item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8577)|
| 2:22:58| that we sort of been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8578)|
| 2:22:59| tossing around for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8579)|
| 2:23:01| So how do you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8581)|
| 2:23:03| want to approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8583)|
| 2:23:03| making this decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8583)|
| 2:23:04| on a month to month basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8584)|
| 2:23:08| You know, personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8588)|
| 2:23:08| I think should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8588)|
| 2:23:09| the executive committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8589)|
| 2:23:12| I'm trying to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8592)|
| 2:23:13| the entire commission together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8593)|
| 2:23:14| and speaking specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8594)|
| 2:23:17| might be a little more of an ordeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8597)|
| 2:23:19| But, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8599)|
| 2:23:20| I think what we've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8600)|
| 2:23:21| in the past is fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8601)|
| 2:23:22| with the executive committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8602)|
| 2:23:25| And also, I'd like to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8605)|
| 2:23:27| that I personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8607)|
| 2:23:28| I was I'm fine getting together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8608)|
| 2:23:30| And but I would never want to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8610)|
| 2:23:32| somebody who feels strongly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8612)|
| 2:23:35| the opposite way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8615)|
| 2:23:36| was not comfortable with doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8616)|
| 2:23:38| I would not want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8618)|
| 2:23:39| push somebody to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8619)|
| 2:23:40| And so, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8620)|
| 2:23:41| I want to make sure that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8621)|
| 2:23:43| when we do meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8623)|
| 2:23:43| that everybody's OK with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8623)|
| 2:23:45| you know, that nobody's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8625)|
| 2:23:48| We're kind of all in the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8628)|
| 2:23:50| on the same page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8630)|
| 2:23:50| with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8630)|
| 2:23:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8635)|
| 2:23:55| So I will set up some regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8635)|
| 2:23:57| executive board meetings to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8637)|
| 2:24:00| Just in case we'll notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8640)|
| 2:24:02| those appropriately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8642)|
| 2:24:02| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8642)|
| 2:24:04| Yes, I had a question about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8644)|
| 2:24:08| And Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8648)|
| 2:24:10| you may be able to speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8650)|
| 2:24:11| too, and Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8651)|
| 2:24:12| When the question came out like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8652)|
| 2:24:14| are we ready to meet in person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8654)|
| 2:24:15| Could we meet in person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8655)|
| 2:24:17| My brain immediately was imagining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8657)|
| 2:24:19| because I've only had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8659)|
| 2:24:20| Zoom experiences with this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8660)|
| 2:24:23| And I thought about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8663)|
| 2:24:25| oh, well, it's the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8665)|
| 2:24:26| on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8666)|
| 2:24:27| And surely we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8667)|
| 2:24:29| fit in that assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8669)|
| 2:24:31| There's enough space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8671)|
| 2:24:32| We can wear masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8672)|
| 2:24:33| and that'll all be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8673)|
| 2:24:35| But then I started thinking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8675)|
| 2:24:37| well, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8677)|
| 2:24:38| There's a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8678)|
| 2:24:39| Staff people who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8679)|
| 2:24:41| on all of these calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8681)|
| 2:24:42| that I can't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8682)|
| 2:24:45| That adds to our number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8685)|
| 2:24:46| And then I've never been part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8686)|
| 2:24:48| of the meetings that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8688)|
| 2:24:50| true in-person meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8690)|
| 2:24:52| where the public is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8692)|
| 2:24:54| So I don't have a good gauge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8694)|
| 2:24:55| about how many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8695)|
| 2:24:56| are we talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8696)|
| 2:24:59| and how do we keep those safe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8699)|
| 2:25:00| So I'm posing that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| to all the commissioners and staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8702)|
| 2:25:04| who have been a part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8704)|
| 2:25:05| of these meetings historically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| and can speak to that a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| can share that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8709)|
| 2:25:10| so I can understand better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8710)|
| 2:25:11| what it would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8711)|
| 2:25:16| Well, Karen, the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8716)|
| 2:25:18| typically have some cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8718)|
| 2:25:21| upwards to over 100 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8721)|
| 2:25:24| and making sure everyone is masked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8724)|
| 2:25:27| everyone is separated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8727)|
| 2:25:30| not only the welfare of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8730)|
| 2:25:32| but the residences also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8732)|
| 2:25:34| And that's what Scott and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8734)|
| 2:25:36| discussed this last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8736)|
| 2:25:38| We asked Amy to send out a questionnaire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8738)|
| 2:25:41| to kind of gauge the opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8741)|
| 2:25:43| of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8743)|
| 2:25:46| We're in new territory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8746)|
| 2:25:47| This is not something any of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8747)|
| 2:25:48| have been confronted with previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8748)|
| 2:25:51| So I think we're just flying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8751)|
| 2:25:52| by the seat of our pants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8752)|
| 2:25:54| and trying to do the best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8754)|
| 2:25:58| I don't see anything changing personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8758)|
| 2:26:00| in the next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8760)|
| 2:26:02| certainly in the next two or three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8762)|
| 2:26:04| I think we'll be on virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8764)|
| 2:26:06| for the next two or three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8766)|
| 2:26:09| Nobody that would like to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8769)|
| 2:26:10| meeting more in person than me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8770)|
| 2:26:13| running and being chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8773)|
| 2:26:14| because it's not a fun day at the beach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8774)|
| 2:26:16| I tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8776)|
| 2:26:18| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8778)|
| 2:26:18| Is there an option where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8778)|
| 2:26:21| the commission is in person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8781)|
| 2:26:26| and we are able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8786)|
| 2:26:28| since the big factor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8788)|
| 2:26:30| of the meeting getting larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8790)|
| 2:26:32| is either with staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8792)|
| 2:26:34| or with the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8794)|
| 2:26:37| is there a way that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8797)|
| 2:26:37| meet in person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8797)|
| 2:26:38| but have virtual communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8798)|
| 2:26:41| with staff and or with the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8801)|
| 2:26:45| So we're kind of shrinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8805)|
| 2:26:47| the size of people who are in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8807)|
| 2:26:49| So you're talking basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8809)|
| 2:26:51| a hybrid type meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8811)|
| 2:26:53| Just to make it more complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8813)|
| 2:26:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8814)|
| 2:26:55| And that is something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8815)|
| 2:26:57| I guess, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8817)|
| 2:26:58| Director Brooks and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8818)|
| 2:26:59| have talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8819)|
| 2:27:01| And I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8821)|
| 2:27:02| I'm going to let Amy address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8822)|
| 2:27:03| but there appears to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8823)|
| 2:27:04| somewhat of a difficulty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8824)|
| 2:27:05| in doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8825)|
| 2:27:06| just from a logistics perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8826)|
| 2:27:10| But Amy, you go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8830)|
| 2:27:12| Yeah, so we haven't actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8832)|
| 2:27:13| tried that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8833)|
| 2:27:14| Knox County BZA was going to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8834)|
| 2:27:17| a bit of a hybrid version this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8837)|
| 2:27:19| They decided to go virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8839)|
| 2:27:20| So I was hoping to be able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8840)|
| 2:27:22| you know, learn from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8842)|
| 2:27:23| and see how they did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8843)|
| 2:27:25| You know, honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8845)|
| 2:27:26| I would prefer to try it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8846)|
| 2:27:28| with a smaller board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8848)|
| 2:27:30| than to try it with this body first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8850)|
| 2:27:32| to just make sure that we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8852)|
| 2:27:34| work out all the kinks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8854)|
| 2:27:35| and logistically make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8855)|
| 2:27:37| I know that PBA and CTV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8857)|
| 2:27:40| it's on their radar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8860)|
| 2:27:41| and they have been working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8861)|
| 2:27:42| in the large assembly room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8862)|
| 2:27:43| where this board typically meets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8863)|
| 2:27:47| to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8867)|
| 2:27:48| So I just need to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8868)|
| 2:27:49| more conversation with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8869)|
| 2:27:50| to see if any other bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8870)|
| 2:27:52| have tried it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8872)|
| 2:27:52| But it's definitely on our radar to try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8872)|
| 2:27:55| One option that you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8875)|
| 2:27:56| might want to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8876)|
| 2:27:57| in the coming months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8877)|
| 2:27:58| is having this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8878)|
| 2:28:01| this Tuesday meeting in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8881)|
| 2:28:03| If we can get the largest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8883)|
| 2:28:05| assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8885)|
| 2:28:06| Again, we don't take public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8886)|
| 2:28:08| comment during these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8888)|
| 2:28:09| but it would still be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8889)|
| 2:28:10| publicly aired on CTV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8890)|
| 2:28:12| And obviously the room is set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8892)|
| 2:28:14| with the plexiglass and mask required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8894)|
| 2:28:16| So that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8896)|
| 2:28:17| for the executive board to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8897)|
| 2:28:21| Commissioner Dent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8901)|
| 2:28:24| Yes, I agree with everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8904)|
| 2:28:25| that's being said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8905)|
| 2:28:26| And I guess I'm on the fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8906)|
| 2:28:29| but I'm more wanting to be in person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8909)|
| 2:28:31| honestly, than, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8911)|
| 2:28:33| virtual ideally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8913)|
| 2:28:35| I suppose a benchmark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8915)|
| 2:28:37| would be the vaccine, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8917)|
| 2:28:39| coming out and being readily available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8919)|
| 2:28:43| Whether people take it or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8923)|
| 2:28:44| is an entire separate conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8924)|
| 2:28:47| But isn't it a requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8927)|
| 2:28:51| in a government building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8931)|
| 2:28:52| for masks to be worn, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8932)|
| 2:28:56| Masks are required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8936)|
| 2:28:57| in the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8937)|
| 2:28:59| OK, so then as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8939)|
| 2:29:00| like the general public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8940)|
| 2:29:01| they would have to wear one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8941)|
| 2:29:03| Would have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8943)|
| 2:29:05| I don't know how it's enforced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8945)|
| 2:29:07| to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8947)|
| 2:29:11| It has not been enforced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8951)|
| 2:29:13| at all of the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8953)|
| 2:29:15| The county commission means to my,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8955)|
| 2:29:18| just from what I've read in the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8958)|
| 2:29:20| So if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8960)|
| 2:29:22| OK, and then just another thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8962)|
| 2:29:26| I can tell that obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8966)|
| 2:29:28| like logistics would take a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8968)|
| 2:29:29| to figure out a hybrid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8969)|
| 2:29:30| but I'd be in favor of something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8970)|
| 2:29:32| along those lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8972)|
| 2:29:33| you know, that could be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8973)|
| 2:29:35| And then not even dealing with the virus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8975)|
| 2:29:37| but just future meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8977)|
| 2:29:39| I think having a virtual portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8979)|
| 2:29:43| would just be more accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8983)|
| 2:29:44| to the community in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8984)|
| 2:29:45| I think that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8985)|
| 2:29:46| that we've discovered in this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8986)|
| 2:29:49| that, you know, a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8989)|
| 2:29:50| don't have the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8990)|
| 2:29:51| to take off work necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8991)|
| 2:29:53| and drive all the way downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8993)|
| 2:29:54| park, you know, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8994)|
| 2:29:56| And so having some ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8996)|
| 2:29:59| to call in and state your case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=8999)|
| 2:30:01| I think, would be really, really cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=9001)|
| 2:30:03| So I think long term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=9003)|
| 2:30:04| trying to work out the kinks of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=9004)|
| 2:30:06| would just be an advantage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=9006)|
| 2:30:08| for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=9008)|
| 2:30:10| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=9010)|
| 2:30:10| Thank you, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=9010)|
| 2:30:11| for bringing it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=9011)|
| 2:30:11| because this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=9011)|
| 2:30:12| we've talked about prior to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=9012)|
| 2:30:14| So prior to the pandemic last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=9014)|
| 2:30:16| we were having internal discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=9016)|
| 2:30:18| on how could we make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=9018)|
| 2:30:19| our meetings more accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=9019)|
| 2:30:21| So long term, it is definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=9021)|
| 2:30:23| our intent to have some type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=9023)|
| 2:30:25| of hybrid option available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=9025)|
| 2:30:27| for people who can't come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=9027)|
| 2:30:28| physically and be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=9028)|
