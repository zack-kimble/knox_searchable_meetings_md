| 0:15:25| Motion is properly before us to approve pending the surrender of the license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=925)|
| 0:15:31| and the completion of server training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Sir, are you family with the current owners or current leasees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| Do you know the history of their sales to minors and their suspensions and such?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| Be very careful that you don't sell to underage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| because they've had two or three violations in the last five or six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| so be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| Be mindful of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| I will be, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| The gentleman from your left will be visiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| We have a proper motion before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| and it's stated pending surrender of license and completion of server training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| Is there other business to come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| Thank you, Mr. Bugatti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| Is there other business to come before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| Just a matter of announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| We now have our previous director at the Metropolitan Drug Council back with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=992)|
| 0:16:38| starting as of this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| Karen Pershing decided to come back with MDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| so I'm very glad, because she did a great job, but she was there before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| so I think she will continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| She came back because we're under a different, well, I shouldn't say that, more sexy name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1012)|
| 0:17:00| No, it was a matter of somebody not getting the job done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1020)|
| 0:17:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| Since Commissioner Brown has named you, we do welcome you back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| She's not Karen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| I'm not Karen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| Please give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| I'm never going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| I'm Debra Huddleston, 4930 Lyons View Pike, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| and I'm the media relations director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| Scott Payne, our previous director that some of you may have met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| he resigned on January 29th to pursue other opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| and our executive committee of the board decided to reach back out to Karen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| to see if she was interested in coming back, and she accepted that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| and today was her first day back on the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| So we're looking forward to having her back, and you guys will see her around, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| Thank you for your brief statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| Is there anything else to come before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| If not, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1080)|
| 0:18:08| Thank you, my fellow commissioners, for your kind attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| If we would come to order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| this is the February meeting of the board of commissioners, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| The very first thing on the agenda is public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| As you see on your agenda, we have only one signed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| but I now have five public forum speakers, and the first is Mayor Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1106)|
| 0:18:36| the honorable mayor of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| Mr. Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Tim Burchett, 501 Princeton Court, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| I want to thank everybody for your hard work this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| especially on getting our two schools underway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| but I need to make a public apology to my friend Ed Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| At Hardin Valley, I did not give you the proper recognition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| and I know as an elected official, especially a legislator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| I can't tell you how many times I was at events and governors would skip over me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| or something and they didn't have anything to do with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| and they got up there and took full credit for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| and that's exactly what I did, and I apologize to you, Mr. Brantley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| knowing that you lived in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| I barely even recognized you if I did at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| and I'm sorry for doing that, brother, and that's my public apology to you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1162)|
| 0:19:28| Mayor Burchett, I owe you forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| Mr. Chairman, a young lady back here who reminded me that we were in school together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1174)|
| 0:19:40| I believe her daughter wanted to speak and was trying to get on the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| I believe her—where is she?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| If you would bring her up there under your wing, you could lend her the—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| Okay, I'll give her the remainder of my time, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| But if she's anything like her mama, she's a big talker, so we're just going to—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| Come on up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| Please, ma'am, name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| Jamie Holacek, 1321 Park Glen Road, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1204)|
| 0:20:14| I come to you today on the behalf of Bearden Middle School Empty Bowls fundraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| Empty Bowls is a fundraising event that will help 100 students at Bearden Middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| by providing weekend food assistance in order to bridge the gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| between Friday lunch and Monday breakfast during the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| Each of you have received an invitation to our event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| and even though you will be in session that evening, you can still help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| It is my understanding that each commissioner has $5,000 in discretionary funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| to benefit the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| We are asking for $275 from each commissioner to give to our fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| which would cover half of our optimistic goal of $6,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| We already know that 44 incoming 6th graders are already receiving food assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| from their elementary schools through a similar partnership with Second Harvest Food Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| Your contribution would ensure that we can serve the needs of these students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| Bearden Middle School is not the average middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| The student body is extremely diverse, and all economic classes attend this school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1276)|
| 0:21:22| Although most people think of Rocky Hill, Bearden Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| and Sequoia students being zoned for Bearden Middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| students across the city attend our school on transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| Also, students from Beaumont, Pond Gap, Maynard, Amherst, West Hills, Westview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1292)|
| 0:21:38| and West Haven feed into BMS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| Our students then attend West, Bearden, Fulton, Carnes, and STEM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1301)|
| 0:21:47| Bearden Middle School doesn't just affect those located right near the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1307)|
| 0:21:53| 55% of students going to BMS qualify for a free and reduced lunch program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| As you may know, we offer a free breakfast and lunch program to all students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| since the number of students on this program is so high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| Unfortunately, there is no way to provide for these kids on the weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| The Empty Bowls event, though it will not eradicate hunger in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| will come to aid of our most needy students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| A full sponsorship of one student costs $60 for a school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| Eighth grade students have been working on handmade bowls after school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| and in our English and art classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| We have secured sponsorships to cover our overhead costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| Two Men and a Truck, Woodman Life, The Soup Kitchen, and Einstein Brothers Bagels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| have been gracious enough to help us reach our goal of helping to end childhood hunger at our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1362)|
| 0:22:49| We have absolutely no overhead, so 100% of donation and ticket sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| will go directly to helping students at Bearden Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| Middle schoolers range from 11 to 14 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| At this age, we cannot possibly provide for ourselves and our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| A typical middle schooler should be concerned with making the grades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| exploring friendships, and their weekend plans, not how they will provide for their next meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1390)|
| 0:23:16| If we had a weekend food assistance program at Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| we can empower the kids benefiting from it to carry their life as a typical middle schooler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1399)|
| 0:23:25| These kids are also the next leaders of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| If these kids cannot focus in school because they've only eaten two meals in the past three days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| how will they grow into the leaders they are destined to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| A team is only as strong as its weakest link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| At Bearden, we are a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| If our weakest links are malnourished, our school cannot grow into the remarkable school it is destined to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1425)|
| 0:23:51| Excellence for every child means feeding them, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| Please consider a donation of $275 to our community project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| As stated in the African proverb, it takes a village to raise a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| Our event proves this true since a whole community must rally together for our neighbors in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1445)|
| 0:24:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1452)|
| 0:24:29| Flyers, should I bring them up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| Yeah, just a minute, please, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| Commissioner Ornby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| Yes, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| I want to applaud you, for one, for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| West Hills is one of those that we do the food bags for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| and once they leave elementary school, they go to middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1484)|
| 0:24:49| A lot of them don't get to eat on the weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| They have very few meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| I applaud you for doing this, and I will go ahead and commit to writing you a check out of my personal account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1495)|
| 0:25:02| because I don't have any discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| But I want to applaud your parents, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| You've raised a wonderful daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| So I'd ask for everybody to get behind these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| These programs are great for all of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| I wish they all had this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| Thank you for letting me be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| Commissioner Brantley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| I just wanted some information on where to send the check, so I guess that's what we're passing around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1526)|
| 0:25:32| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| It has the information where to send the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| Yes, it's on the handout sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| You did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| You were on public forum without the assistance of the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| Again, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| I do not want you to know that you have any pull through the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| Continuing with public forum, the next presenter is Gabby Swenson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1558)|
| 0:26:10| My name is Gabby Swenson, 11345 Hardin Valley Road, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1570)|
| 0:26:18| Chairman Wright and members of the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| my name is Gabby Swenson and I'm a junior at Hardin Valley Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| Thank you for this opportunity to speak to you on behalf of an exciting educational opportunity for students at Hardin Valley Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1584)|
| 0:26:32| Hopefully all of you know who Alexander Hamilton is or maybe even his accomplishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1592)|
| 0:26:38| You may know that he is on the $10 bill or that he was the first secretary of the treasury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| But what you may not know is that he wrote the Reynolds pamphlet in which he published the details of this extramarital affair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| or that his son and he died in the same place in the same way, a duel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1609)|
| 0:26:55| The new Broadway musical written by Lin-Manuel Miranda titled Hamilton taught me and my fellow classmates these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1615)|
| 0:27:03| Hamilton is a new sought after Broadway musical that is taking the world by storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| Since it is educational, it can be utilized in the classroom and that is exactly what my AP U.S. History class has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1628)|
| 0:27:16| The students along with my teacher Miss Guy have fallen in love with this interesting twist on history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| It is appealing to people of all ages and it is currently showing on Broadway in New York City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1642)|
| 0:27:28| In the AP United States History course and exam description, it outlines the objectives for each period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1648)|
| 0:27:35| In key concept 3.2, it is mentioned that students need to know about the Federalist Papers written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1655)|
| 0:27:45| It also says students must know about the formation of political parties and most significantly the Federalist led by Alexander Hamilton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1665)|
| 0:27:53| and the Democratic Republican Party led by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| The musical elaborates on these topics as well as the increased awareness and inequalities in the society at the time of the revolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1678)|
| 0:28:05| All things students will need to know to pass the AP exam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| I want to send 18 students and two teachers to see this musical on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| As stated before, this musical is all factual and it would increase each student's knowledge of the revolution and Alexander Hamilton greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1695)|
| 0:28:24| I truly believe this would be an extremely beneficial opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| After our return, each student will complete a project on Alexander Hamilton and his contributions to the revolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1709)|
| 0:28:37| as well as the inequalities and significance of class order during the time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| Chairman Wright, members of County Commission, I come to you tonight to ask for your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| It is my understanding that each of you have discretionary dollars available in your respective budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1728)|
| 0:28:54| We would love to give you the opportunity to make a contribution to our educational efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1734)|
| 0:29:01| Mr. Chairman, may I distribute a packet about the production estimated cost of my contact information should you consider a donation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1741)|
| 0:29:09| Please finish your presentation and then we'll catch your...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| Once again, thank you so much for the opportunity to speak to you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| Okay. Are there questions or discussions of this presenter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| So she's going to give us the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| Commissioner Oyenbee has gone to pick up the flyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| Again, Ms. Swenson, we appreciate your being here before us for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1771)|
| 0:29:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| The next presenter is Xavier Presley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1783)|
| 0:29:53| My name is Xavier Presley, 1134 Glade Hill Drive, Knoxville, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1793)|
| 0:30:00| Just to mention about Bearden Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| That's probably one of the best schools in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| Our daughter is there and she's in the top 5% of the smartest in the whole country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| And she left West Hills to go to Bearden Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| Dr. McIntyre is doing such a good job of supporting these teachers and these principals that we all need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1814)|
| 0:30:21| He is, the 10 years he's been here, you can't ask for a better person to lead us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| These kids at Bearden Middle School, they deserve the help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| They've proven to you all they need the help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| And they'll continue to stride even without the help that we could give these kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| That principal, that program they got from Verizon, it is going real good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1837)|
| 0:30:43| So far they haven't had no glitches or no problems with that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| And then they got the teachers there, especially the 6th grade teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| This one lady, she's fresh out of school, Emily James, an English teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| This lady stays there from 6 a.m. to almost 6 p.m. even on her own time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1855)|
| 0:31:02| We went to a parent conference last week and this lady was the last one to leave the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1862)|
| 0:31:08| That's how good Dr. McIntyre's leadership is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| But what I'm here for is KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| I was told from a KUB employee to ask everyone in here, what does KUB stand for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| Keeping us broke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| If you think about it, look at the examples they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| This employee told me that the employees are not happy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| the idea that they're working for KUB for a paycheck, benefits, and retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1891)|
| 0:31:40| I got my bill in the mail Wednesday, and it's $48 more than it was last cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1900)|
| 0:31:47| Two random strangers at Walmart, I asked them what was their bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| They said $48 over than it was last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| Something is not right with this program, KUB is telling you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| The city council said nobody governs KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| They can do what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| I went to that Judge Stevenson when I went on jury duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| She said nothing I can do about KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| Then, KUB board, they seem to be just take this for granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| and just do what they want to do, and nobody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| I got a letter from the governor's office about where I complained to Consumer Affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| They wrote Dale Grubb, the manager of KUB, he wrote him back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| told him that he assisted Mr. Presley to the CAC Keene weatherization program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| I don't even know that guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| KUB didn't help me, and KUB didn't help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| I went and stood in that line for two and a half hours and got authorized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| Today, they finally finished everything in my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| The guy asked me, he said, has your bill gone down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| I said, no, it's $48 over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| This guy came with an inspector to my house today from Power Brothers Contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| and his bill was $48 over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| Then I called KUB Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| I'm standing at Walmart letting everybody hear me talk to KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| They said, amen, brother, tell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| They're ripping us off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| All I'm asking you people to do is just try to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| The work that the Power Brothers did to my house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| they put 24 inches of insulin in the attic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| They put 18 in the crawl space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| They gave us a brand-new air-conditioned heat system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| They gave us a brand-new Lowe's refrigerator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| They gave us a brand-new computerized heat pump for the hot water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| They sealed up all the cracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| They put in windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| They sealed up the fireplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| They did all the doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| They put in seven smoke detectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| And my bill still is up this high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| I don't know whether I'm going to continue to complain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| For the ten years I've been here, nine years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| I've been complaining to KUB board every time I get a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| And this one lady, Amy Broad, this lady needs to be the next governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| Out of everybody I see up here, I have more respect for her than anyone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| because she's trying to do the right thing by helping the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2042)|
| 0:34:09| Commissioner Brantley, did you have a question for this presenter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| But I think he answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| My question would be, sir, you have gone before the KUB board of directors then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| I've been going before their board for nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| Nine years, and it's still $48 high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| Now, I have a board also, just a personal story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| But last month we had KUB Gas out in Hardin Valley where I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| and for some reason we're just way up this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| And the question always is, has it been that cold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| Why is it higher this year than last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| I think utility bills is the hardest thing to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| because it's just a meter, and whether it's being averaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| or it's the actual reading or what do you think about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| I say just be fair and be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| Let them come in front of you and show some evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| Two years ago, they gave all their customers in Florida| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| an $8 deduction off their utility bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| That same period, KUB raised everybody's bill $8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| Well, you know, there's a lot of different things between here and Florida,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| and we don't have time for an argument here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| But I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| I just wanted to make sure that you were going before KUB and the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| which governs KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| I called the governing board, and they said they have no control over what KUB does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2123)|
| 0:35:29| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| And the final presenter in public forum today, Liza Zini.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2133)|
| 0:35:45| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| Liza Zini, 113 Baylor Drive, 37830.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| Thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| I'm here tonight to report on Knox County's return on investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| For the last four years, Knox County has contracted with the Arts and Culture Alliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| for a tourism-geared contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| We administer that contract at the Arts and Culture Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| We don't take a penny of the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| We don't charge our members a penny of the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| It has been 25 organizations, and now it's going to be 22 organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2177)|
| 0:36:24| It's in flux based on who is doing activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2184)|
| 0:36:30| The Sesquicentennial Commission no longer is doing activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| so they're no longer a part of the consortium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| The organizations that are in the consortium range in size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| from the Knoxville Jazz Orchestra to Ola Ora Latina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| and the historic homes of Knoxville all the way up to the McClellan Museum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| the KMA, the Knoxville Symphony, and the Tennessee Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| So we've got the small ones all the way up to the very biggest ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| And together, these organizations represent a $27 million industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2216)|
| 0:37:02| Together, they contribute $15 million in wages and contracts to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2222)|
| 0:37:09| They keep them working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| They keep them living in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| Together, they also contribute $27 million in direct purchases to local businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| local vendors, and their audiences spent more than $49 million last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2239)|
| 0:37:27| and they contributed with that $4.5 million just in sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| So we hope that you feel that that is a really good return on Knox County's investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2252)|
| 0:37:38| These attractions have provided nearly 4,000 activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| to delight the cultural tourist every day of the year from July 1st to June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2262)|
| 0:37:49| So who is the cultural tourist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| In the Cultural and Heritage Traveler Study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| they define the cultural tourist as people who travel to visit historic sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| attend historic reenactments, visit art museums and galleries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| attend art fairs or festivals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| people who come to see a professional dance or music or opera performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| In other words, the cultural tourist is the arts and culture fan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| And why do we care so much about them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| Well, because they outstay, outtravel, and outspend any other types of tourists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| They spend $62 more a day when they come here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| and $200 more a visit when they come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| There are more cultural tourists out there for us to snag, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| Cultural travelers took 5.1 trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| versus the non-cultural traveler who took 3.98 trips a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| 24% of them are planning another trip next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| which is why we want that contract renewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| We want them to come here, and they have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| We have photographs of visitors from Canada, India, Costa Rica,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| the Czech Republic, Ireland, France, Germany, Japan, Brazil, and the United Kingdom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| In fact, in the first six months of this fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| that's from July through December of 2015 alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| the attractions in this consortium attracted a whopping 454,000 cultural tourists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2350)|
| 0:39:19| How do we know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| Because we count them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| We count every one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| Cultural tourists from the region like Rogersville, Rutledge, Herriman, and Jefferson City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| spent $7.6 million in Knox County in the first six months of this fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2370)|
| 0:39:36| and contributed $707,000 in sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| From beyond the region, from as close as Nashville to California and beyond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2381)|
| 0:39:48| they contributed $34 million to Knox County and $3.2 million of that in sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2388)|
| 0:39:56| When they're here, they're temporary taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| who save each Knox County family $349 a year in their own taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2400)|
| 0:40:07| When the money in the consortium goes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| visitation by visitors goes up at these attractions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| We're not quite sure why that is, but we're checking it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| We want to say that we work with Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| They're a great partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| They help promote what we do, and we feed them things to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2422)|
| 0:40:28| We work with the Greater Knoxville Hospitality Association, the Tennessee Department of Tourism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| and in the next year, our attractions are upping their game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| In 2016, they will be doing a special unprecedented joint celebration of the city's 225th birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2437)|
| 0:40:46| In 2017, we want to do something to celebrate the county's 225th birthday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| and we hope that in 2018, we will be on the road to make Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2451)|
| 0:40:57| the signature place for statehood day in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| because Knoxville was the state capital when the state of Tennessee was made a state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2461)|
| 0:41:07| and we think that we can really carve out a good niche there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| We feel it's a good investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| It saves Knox County a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| There's not 22 different contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| There's just one, and it earns a tremendous return on investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| And for each dollar in that contract, we thought you'd like to know that is invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| It returns $41 in contributions to Knox County jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2491)|
| 0:41:37| That same dollar returns $192 in income to local vendors and businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| and more than $12 in sales tax collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| Commissioner Thomas, do you have a question of this presenter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| I would just like to add that this is a lean, mean machine, the Arts and Culture Alliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2512)|
| 0:41:59| and Lisa operates this with her huge staff of one other person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| And I'm on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| I'm very fortunate to be on this board and watch what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| And instead of all 22 of these people marching in front of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| she does it for them, and then it passes through and they don't take a penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| Really an excellent job, and we're very fortunate to have her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| and her one-person staff doing this for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| It's our pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2548)|
| 0:42:34| And if there be anyone in the audience who would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| the Knox County Guide for the Cultural Tourist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| I have a copy of it, and it will be here for you to look at at the adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2561)|
| 0:42:50| We will now move into honorary resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| This is Resolution R-16-2-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2577)|
| 0:43:03| Designating February 23, 2016 as Fay Day in Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2583)|
| 0:43:10| Commissioner Thomas, do I have a motion that this be approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| I so move there, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| The motion is properly before us. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| Opposed, no. Motion carries, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2600)|
| 0:43:25| Before we read the proclamation into the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| I'd just like to say I'm on the board of the Young-Williams Animal Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| and a lot of people don't realize that the Young-Williams Animal Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| is the intake for Knox County and Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| They cannot refuse to take any animals that come into our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2618)|
| 0:43:43| that are strays or that are found or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| And so they do an incredible job of getting these pets adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| and we're celebrating something special tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| It's National Spay Day across the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| We want to make it Spay Day in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| And I want to add that Young-Williams since June of 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2643)|
| 0:44:09| just recently celebrated 5,000 surgeries, 50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| That's even better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| 50,000 spay-neuter surgeries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| and if you can imagine how many animals that would have been on our streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2660)|
| 0:44:26| it would have been incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| So I have with us the people that make up the Young-Williams Animal Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| Jeff Ashton, who is the executive director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| Dr. Christy Lively is the chairman of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| and other members of the staff here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| I think it's a great thing that they've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| and if you ever get a chance to visit Young-Williams Animal Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| you'll be very impressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| It is on Division Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| and there's another location on top of Bearden Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| but you need to just go in there and walk around and see how clean it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| how nice it is, how presentable it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| and what a great thing we're doing for our animals here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| I want to add Commissioner Brown to this as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| because he served on the board for, what, six, seven years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| And he's a very big part of this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| So if you don't mind, who wants to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| This is Jeff Ashton, who is the executive director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| Thank you very much for this consideration today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| We greatly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| We feel very supported by the county as well as the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| and we thank you, commissioners, for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| I want to just express that I think you may have all received an email from me in the last few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| We have a movie that was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| It's called The Southern Fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| It's been done by some professional documentary people here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| It will document the plight of animals and animal welfare organizations in the Southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2748)|
| 0:45:53| The first VIP premiere is the 29th of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| I've invited you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| We'd like you to come to Scruffy City Hall at 730 to see this film.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| We are prominently featured as a shining example of what can be done in the Southeast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| as it relates to spay and neuter and controlling the animal population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| So, again, we just want to thank you for this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| thank you for your continued support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| and tell you how much we are honored to be the official shelter for the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2775)|

| 0:46:22| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| Commissioner Brown, do you have a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| I'd just like to add to what Commissioner Thomas said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| I served six years on the board with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| and about four years or so ago we had a little bit of a downswing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2797)|
| 0:46:45| and had to make some adjustments and hires and so forth and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| But it's unbelievable the turnaround that this group has made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| in what we have down there now on Division Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| It is a premier operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| Somebody mentioned earlier, and Bob said, you know, they have to take everything in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| even up to kangaroos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| So they do this not only from our county, but they come in from other counties as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2826)|
| 0:47:13| We do get a little bit of rebate from some of these counties for some of the work that we do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2833)|
| 0:47:19| But I'd just like to say a big shout-out to this group for what they've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2839)|
| 0:47:23| particularly over the last four years, in bringing Young Williams to where it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2843)|
| 0:47:33| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2853)|
| 0:47:34| Do you want me to read this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2854)|

| 0:47:39| Well, we don't have to read it all, but I can read some of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| Okay, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| I wanted to point out a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| There's a lot of whereases, most of whereases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2866)|

| 0:47:57| for all animals in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| whereas the Young Williams Animal Center recently achieved the mark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| of performing 50,000 spay-neuter surgeries since July of 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=2882)|

| 1:07:37| Reporting presentation by the Legacy Parks Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4057)|
| 1:07:43| Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| While we were going through here, I just received a note from Carol Evans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| who was going to present the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| She's in Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| She had to attend to her dad, who is ill, and she said she's sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4075)|
| 1:08:01| and wondered if she could do it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| This item, Legacy Parks Foundation, discussion item and presentation report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| be deferred to our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| The next item is, without objection, seeing no objections, it will be next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4095)|
| 1:08:25| Next is a discussion item regarding the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4105)|
| 1:08:30| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| I would like to request that the Commission appoint another commissioner to the Audit Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4116)|
| 1:08:48| in addition to what we have, so that we can be guaranteed a quorum when we meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4128)|
| 1:08:54| If that needs to be put in the form of a motion, I will do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| You've got to change the audit charter, I think, to do that, don't you, Mr. Potter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| I'm going to ask the question, are you proposing that the Audit Committee stays the same size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4142)|
| 1:09:12| or are you proposing that it be a body of six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4152)|
| 1:09:17| Add one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4157)|
| 1:09:18| Six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4158)|
| 1:09:19| Be a body of six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| You should present that to the Audit Committee, make an audit charter change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4163)|
| 1:09:30| refer it back to this body, then make that motion to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4170)|
| 1:09:41| The agenda for the Audit Committee is under the control of, who makes the Audit Committee's agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4181)|
| 1:09:52| The Audit Committee and the Chairman, they make their agenda based upon their plan, work plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| Who types it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| If I might, the Chairman sends in to Joe Lee and to our office his proposed agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4201)|
| 1:10:13| and then Joe Lee, we look at it, and then Joe Lee sends it out to all the members and posts it publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4213)|
| 1:10:23| Let me ask this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| I know that it's unusual to have six members on a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4226)|
| 1:10:33| although I don't really see a problem with that in regards to this particular committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4233)|
| 1:10:39| because anything that would be voted on would be brought here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4239)|
| 1:10:47| Do you feel like that we should maybe add two to make it seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4247)|
| 1:10:54| What's the thought of the Commission before we take it to the Audit Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| What's your suggestion, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| Well, the charter's the pleasure of the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| You all can make a recommendation here as to your pleasure since you're basically over them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4265)|
| 1:11:10| but the procedure would have to take an amendment of their charter to be brought before you all for the final vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4270)|
| 1:11:16| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| Whatever you all in your discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4278)|
| 1:11:23| whatever you all deem to ask these members to take back to the committee and recommend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4283)|
| 1:11:29| you're Audit Committee members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| It's another board, is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4291)|
| 1:11:35| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| If you're going to add anybody, I would add, if you wanted to add somebody just to get a quorum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4296)|
| 1:11:41| I would add a commissioner and a citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| I don't know if you put any qualifications on them, but a board of six won't do you any good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4305)|
| 1:11:50| because nothing will come out of the committee if it's a tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4310)|
| 1:11:55| If you're going to add, if you want to add another commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| add a commissioner and a citizen or two citizens, but I wouldn't just do one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4318)|
| 1:12:04| Commissioner Brown, you and I need to make a note here to make sure that when this is discussed at the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4324)|
| 1:12:10| that we get the Audit Committee's full input into what might be thought to be a way to get where we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4330)|
| 1:12:23| There are other items of the Audit Committee that need to be discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| but I think that we've had this as a held over item for about three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4346)|
| 1:12:32| There are some commissioners here that are familiar with the external audit that we have had presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4352)|
| 1:12:39| It's been, that was back in December, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4359)|
| 1:12:43| If anyone would care to discuss the Audit Committee any further about results or outcome from the external audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4363)|
| 1:12:55| Seeing no further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| Just to say that the report that was presented to the Audit Committee was pretty, you know, really complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4377)|
| 1:13:05| They didn't find any problems that were not minor that weren't, you know, immediately corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4385)|
| 1:13:10| So, as far as the Audit Committee is concerned, I think we were happy with it and would pass that information along to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4390)|
| 1:13:20| Thank you, Commissioner Brown. I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4400)|
| 1:13:25| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| Discussion regarding Knox County's record service rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| If you could imagine a situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4415)|
| 1:13:39| You're driving home this evening, and you have an automobile accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| Whether it's your fault or not, but you're involved in an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| No injuries. You're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| But the deputy sheriff arrives. It's in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| The deputy sheriff arrives, and investigating the accident, lets you know that your car is undriveable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4432)|
| 1:13:59| And the officer asks, who do you want me to call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4439)|
| 1:14:03| Because you can't leave it in the middle of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| And you're a little shook up, just had an automobile accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| You may have family members with you, or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4450)|
| 1:14:13| And it's probably something you haven't thought about lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4453)|
| 1:14:17| And you say, I don't know. You tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| And he says, well, we have a list, and I guess we can go to the next service that's on that list, or the service that's assigned to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4461)|
| 1:14:28| Okay, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| So you do that. The wrecker guy pulls up, tows your car, sweeps the glass off the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4469)|
| 1:14:36| You call somebody to come get you. You're talking about the accident, whose fault it is, or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4476)|
| 1:14:42| And then you start working through that process, and later on, you find out some different information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4482)|
| 1:14:49| In Knox County, we do not have a set towing fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| The city of Knoxville charges $144 to tow a regular car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4493)|
| 1:14:59| That's the maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| In Knox County, it can be anything that the tow company wants to charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4501)|
| 1:15:06| And we have a gentleman with us tonight who came to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| Would you stand up and come up to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| And this is where all this came from. This isn't anything that I imagined and came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| Would you identify yourself and tell us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| I'm Paul Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| Address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4521)|
| 1:15:22| Now, yeah, go ahead and give your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| 244 Covered Bridge Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| Now, tell us what happened to you, Paul. How all this started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| You came to commission a month ago, I guess it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| Yeah, pretty much like you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| I was in an accident over the Thanksgiving weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4535)|
| 1:15:40| And the county sheriffs came out and wrote up the accident report, and the car was undriveable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4540)|
| 1:15:49| And they said, do you want us to call a wrecker service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| And I actually tried to call my insurance agent to see what wrecker service they would use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4554)|
| 1:16:00| But they were actually closed because it was a holiday for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4560)|
| 1:16:05| And so they called the one they had on contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4565)|
| 1:16:09| They came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| Well, that was on a Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| And towed the car to, it's about 15 miles at the most from where the accident occurred to their lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4573)|
| 1:16:21| And the following Monday, I tried to get it picked up and discover that my bill for towing it 15 miles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4581)|
| 1:16:32| including the couple of days' storage, was over $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4592)|
| 1:16:37| I think I showed you, I brought a sample of the bill, partially of the bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4597)|
| 1:16:44| because when I went to get to the place to get my car, or actually I couldn't get the car because the bill was so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4604)|
| 1:16:55| So in order to pay for the bill, I had to forfeit my title to the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| And when I forfeited my title, I asked for at least an itemized copy and could not get an itemized copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4620)|
| 1:17:05| So I was able to take a photocopy with my phone because they refused to give me an itemized copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4625)|
| 1:17:12| But I took a photocopy with my phone, and that's what I gave you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4632)|
| 1:17:17| I showed you a picture of it three months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| And that shows that you have a $350 charge for the tow, a $50 gate fee, and a $50 cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4639)|
| 1:17:28| I don't think they were cleaning up your car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| I guess that was the accident site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| But what's the gate fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4652)|
| 1:17:33| Do you know what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4653)|
| 1:17:34| It's just an extra charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| Tell me about your experience with the person at the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| Well, pretty much like I said, I said, can I get an itemized copy of this bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4659)|
| 1:17:45| They said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| I was, like, shocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| Like, I can't get an itemized copy of my bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| I'm handing you my title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| And I said, can I take a picture with my phone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| He said yeah, and that's what I was able to obtain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| Couldn't get an itemized copy though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4680)|
| 1:18:01| Now let's go back to that accident we just had on the way home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4681)|
| 1:18:05| And what if the deputy sheriff who pulls up to talk about towing your car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4685)|
| 1:18:09| gives you a piece of paper that's provided by Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| that gives you a list of different record services and the charges they have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| This is what it's going to cost if we call this record service to pull your car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4696)|
| 1:18:20| At least the consumer would have some type of judgmental call of what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4700)|
| 1:18:26| Now, the city of Knoxville has a committee, a government committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4706)|
| 1:18:31| that meets with record services, approves the record services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| approves the insurance, and sets the charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| And I guess they do that by vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| And it seems to be working pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| I'm not necessarily saying we should do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| However, it may be an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4724)|
| 1:18:45| What I am saying is that the consumer should know what they're up against when this happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| because they're not in any position to make a good decision probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4730)|
| 1:18:54| Would you agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| So that's what I'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| Anybody want to join in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| You got any solutions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4741)|
| 1:19:02| Let's go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4742)|
| 1:19:03| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| Thank you, sir, for being here and bringing this to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4745)|
| 1:19:09| The number one thing I think everybody up here wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| is every citizen of Knox County to be treated fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4752)|
| 1:19:18| We're not indicting any record services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| because if they don't have any guidelines they have to follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| they may be just shooting from the hip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| So we've somehow got to come up with exactly what it should cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4767)|
| 1:19:33| whether it's by miles, how far away you are from wherever it's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4773)|
| 1:19:38| We've got to come up with something that's fair for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4778)|
| 1:19:43| I'm not saying be unreasonable to the record services either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| but we've got to let everybody know exactly what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4786)|
| 1:19:50| They should be able to see what it's going to be so that they understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4790)|
| 1:19:54| And then if they want an itemized bill, they should be able to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4794)|
| 1:19:58| So however, Mr. Chairman, we need to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4798)|
| 1:20:02| we've got to step forward and get on into the 20th century| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| and start making sure our citizens are treated fairly in these situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4806)|
| 1:20:14| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| I'm looking out in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| and I don't see anybody still here from the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4819)|
| 1:20:25| My question would be, is there such a list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| How is it disseminated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| Who sets the list and who sets the cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4833)|
| 1:20:39| There should be some sort of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4839)|
| 1:20:44| Well, I asked the Sheriff's Department, pardon me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| I called them and asked them and spoke with Lee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| and he agrees that it's just the wide open West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| There is no set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| Did they present you with any options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| No, they just said I can call a record service for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4861)|
| 1:21:02| So I don't think we have, or they told me that we didn't have a procedure in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4862)|
| 1:21:08| Well, I think we need to have somebody from the Sheriff's Department here next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4868)|
| 1:21:14| to answer some of these questions, and maybe we do need to set some guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4874)|
| 1:21:21| But until we hear from the other side, I don't think we can really decide anything at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4881)|
| 1:21:28| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| Who was the record service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| It was Southern Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| Yeah, of course me and Ed are kind of, Ed called Lee and I called Rich,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4899)|
| 1:21:45| and so we kind of hit it from both sides there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| But to let you kind of know what we would be getting into, and I'm not against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4908)|
| 1:21:53| is the city has a contract record for each zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4913)|
| 1:21:58| I don't know if it's dealing with traffic zones, which is in the CAD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| which I mean you all don't care about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| But the records then have a set rate by contract what they can charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4924)|
| 1:22:09| and things they can do if they dolly a car and other things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4929)|
| 1:22:15| But we would have to form a record commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| We would have to have cooperation with the Sheriff's Office and have record inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| Every record has to be inspected every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| The drivers have to be background checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| The city has done it already, but I mean it's not a small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| hey, let's pass an ordinance kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| This is a cost measure, and I don't disagree with it at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| but it's not a simple task for the law department, the Sheriff's Office, or us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4958)|
| 1:22:43| because most of us would sit on that record commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| because I think council is the record commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| Just to kind of let you know, KPD has four people assigned to do records and taxis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| and so that's the extent of the manpower it would take to take care of all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4972)|
| 1:22:57| So just to let you know what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| But I don't disagree with we need to do something because $500 is too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4983)|
| 1:23:07| On my insurance company for the cars, I have a rider that says towing fee on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4987)|
| 1:23:14| I also carry AAA, which has a towing on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| and I also have one that comes from the camping club that I belong to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=4998)|
| 1:23:29| and when I need something done, a tire changed or a car pulled in or a camper pulled in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5009)|
| 1:23:35| they call it, they take care of it, and it's paid for by my insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| Now, you could do that, or you could go without insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5019)|
| 1:23:48| and that way we wouldn't get into this legality of having to rule against these record companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5028)|
| 1:23:56| But I think you do need to have something that you're not gouging the public with also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5036)|
| 1:24:02| But that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| Common misconception that AAA won't pay for a wreck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| everybody will say call for AAA and you get the full rate whenever you get that bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| because AAA don't do wrecks, but they'll call their wrecker, but you're paying that wrecker's full rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5051)|
| 1:24:15| And so if we don't have regulation, then it can be anything they want to charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| But there's three different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5060)|
| 1:24:21| My point, thank you, Mr. Chairman, my point is, and I'm not here suggesting any type of regulation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5061)|
| 1:24:26| my only point in this is to bring this up because, I mean, it could happen to your child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5066)|
| 1:24:35| it could happen to you, and it probably has happened to some of your friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5075)|
| 1:24:39| But I just think that there should be some way that people do not feel like this man feels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5079)|
| 1:24:45| that he's been had over something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| And that's not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| Now, it would be great if all the record companies got together and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| this is the charges we're going to charge in Knox County, that would be wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5094)|
| 1:24:57| But I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5097)|
| 1:24:58| I mean, we have so many regulations anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| Who needs more regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5100)|
| 1:25:03| One of the things, and it may be the simplest thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| is to have some type of a piece of paper that the deputy has in their patrol car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5105)|
| 1:25:10| that they can hand to the person and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| here's a list of wrecker services that are available in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5112)|
| 1:25:17| and this is what they say they charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5117)|
| 1:25:21| Commissioner Brantley, would you contact the Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| and have them present us with a representative of the Sheriff's Office at our next work session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5123)|
| 1:25:31| Yes, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| That's a head-on discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| And, Mr. Johnson, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| This is two times you've been here, and I know that's a lot of out-of-public expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5136)|
| 1:25:40| And we'll take over from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| You may not have to come next time, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| I appreciate your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5144)|
| 1:25:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5145)|
| 1:25:46| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5146)|
| 1:25:47| We'll try to see what we can come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5149)|
| 1:25:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5150)|
| 1:25:51| Seeing no further discussion, thank you, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| Discussion regarding school vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5161)|
| 1:26:05| Mr. Schoonmaker and I were in Nashville about three or four weeks ago to go over bills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5165)|
| 1:26:13| and one of the things that came up was a school voucher but has now been tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5173)|
| 1:26:19| However, in looking and finding out about different counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| I was Googling school vouchers and come to find out we do have a school voucher system here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5183)|
| 1:26:31| And it has to do with the, I guess, disabled school kids that are in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5191)|
| 1:26:41| And after looking at that bill, there is no guidelines to say what it's going to cost the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5201)|
| 1:26:48| to put that voucher system in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5208)|
| 1:26:51| It doesn't say, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| And to get around the one other thing, the federal guidelines that goes with some of the federal monies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5215)|
| 1:27:03| is not in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5223)|
| 1:27:04| How do you deal with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| If it's not in there and you take federal money as part of this voucher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5226)|
| 1:27:11| then private schools come under the rule of the government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5231)|
| 1:27:15| which requires a lot of different things for those voucher systems for even the handicapped kids that go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5235)|
| 1:27:25| The only way that it seems like that you can get around it is give the money directly to the parent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5245)|
| 1:27:32| and therefore the parent can pay for the service that they want to have for this child in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5252)|
| 1:27:39| My question is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| You're withdrawing that child from the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5261)|
| 1:27:45| You're giving the money to the parent so they can get in private school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5265)|
| 1:27:49| which it looks like the vouchers are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| And therefore that child is taking off the role of Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5272)|
| 1:27:57| which state's monies follow that child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5277)|
| 1:28:02| Now, if you have so many of those that come out of there and they run out of the funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5282)|
| 1:28:07| they can still come back to the public schools because of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5287)|
| 1:28:13| We have to have everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| You know, the kids can be given fair and equitable education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5295)|
| 1:28:20| But the state will say we've already given the money to that child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5300)|
| 1:28:24| so who's going to pay for that child coming back in the school if that money is mishandled by the parent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5304)|
| 1:28:32| That's going to cost us extra money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| So we've got to get some sort of clarity from the state on how we handle these voucher systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5315)|
| 1:28:41| It's the only thing that I'm bringing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| And it's a strange thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| We've taken out, we've reduced the child's attendance to public school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5327)|
| 1:28:52| That funding goes with the child, but if they have to come back to public schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| the money does not follow them back to the school is the way it reads to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5336)|
| 1:29:02| And we've had a discussion in the law office, and they said, well, that's kind of the way we look at it too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5342)|
| 1:29:08| but we don't have any ruling from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| So my point is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| Who do we need to talk to to clarify how this money, our voucher system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5353)|
| 1:29:18| will work with the voucher system we have in place now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| Do we have anybody here from the school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| Commissioner Bussler, you, the commissioner O&B, who are the members of the joint committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5367)|
| 1:29:39| Right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5379)|
| 1:29:40| And me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| So this discussion might best be approached in the joint committee to see what the Board of Education may think of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5382)|
| 1:29:54| And that's what I was going to discuss once it gets to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5397)|
| 1:29:58| Okay, like I say, the only reason I'm bringing this up, once that money follows the student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5398)|
| 1:30:07| is we will have to reinvest our own funds that we didn't get from the state for that student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5407)|
| 1:30:13| And like I say, we haven't been explained to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| and we haven't heard lately that we do have that voucher system here explained to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5416)|
| 1:30:22| But anyway, I just bring it up to give that point to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| If the joint committee would tackle that subject, you might bring back to us a recommendation if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5425)|
| 1:30:33| Any further discussion on vouchers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5433)|
| 1:30:37| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| Discussion regarding the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5439)|
| 1:30:43| The next item I have brought, and it is not about what the budget's going to be, it's about the dates of the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5443)|
| 1:30:52| Today is February the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5452)|
| 1:30:56| June the 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| We have to have in place a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5457)|
| 1:31:02| In between now and then, we have to have a presentation from the administration, Knox County Mayor Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5462)|
| 1:31:14| And I believe Mr. Caldwell is on his feet to address part of that, but let me continue on for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5474)|
| 1:31:21| We should also, I think, have one public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5481)|
| 1:31:25| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5485)|
| 1:31:26| One public hearing, and then have a meeting at which we approve the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5486)|
| 1:31:37| The reason I bring it up is because in the last cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5497)|
| 1:31:42| we had some people that were unavailable at certain dates due to vacation or cruises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5502)|
| 1:31:52| I don't know who might take a cruise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5512)|
| 1:31:56| But we need to begin to look at getting these dates of the presentation by the mayor and staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5516)|
| 1:32:07| when we would have a public hearing and when we might have an approval meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5527)|
| 1:32:12| not saying we're setting that tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| but saying that we need to make sure that within the next meeting cycle that we know when those dates are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5536)|
| 1:32:24| Mr. Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| The mayor will make his budget presentation to county commission on Monday, May the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5549)|
| 1:32:44| Here at 8 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| We just know it's Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| Yeah, probably like 9 a.m. I think is what it usually is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| That's okay. Monday, May the 9th in the a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| I don't know what the schedule in May is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| Is our work session on a regular Monday? Do we have to fight with city council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5581)|
| 1:33:11| If we have a clear month, I would suggest having the public hearing after the work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5591)|
| 1:33:16| because everybody's probably going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| I think that would allow ample time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5599)|
| 1:33:31| You're going to get the most here, because everybody's schedules are vacations around commission dates anyway, usually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5611)|
| 1:33:36| Right. That's the thing that I'm looking for, is people be on board about when we're going to do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5616)|
| 1:33:42| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| There's a possibility that I may be at a national risk management conference from June 1st to June 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5626)|
| 1:33:54| I just wanted to put that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| You gave dates in June, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5640)|
| 1:34:01| Okay. So what we're looking at is shooting toward all May dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5641)|
| 1:34:07| And normally that's what we do, but sometimes things have rolled to June, have they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5647)|
| 1:34:14| And then what's the flavor of commission about the approval date at the May stated meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5654)|
| 1:34:25| I don't think you can do that. I think you have to have a special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5665)|
| 1:34:30| You don't have to. We just usually did, depending on what the agenda looked like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5670)|
| 1:34:35| what was the reason that we made that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| I would have a backup date just in your pocket, because you've got the 16th and the 23rd are your commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5678)|
| 1:34:51| It depends on what your agenda looks like. You can do it in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| You can do it in the meeting, but it depends on what your discussion and what it's looking like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5694)|
| 1:34:59| I would have a 26th backup date or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5699)|
| 1:35:06| Based on experience, we've had to separate it because the agenda got pretty clouded there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5706)|
| 1:35:17| Wednesday is the church night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5717)|
| 1:35:25| Would it be better to have it before commission and after the work session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5725)|
| 1:35:30| I think it's after, because you've got one week to digest what the public has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| There may be some issues that we need to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| I would have a fallback date after the commission meeting and before Randy leaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5738)|
| 1:35:47| We've got a part of this ground plowed. Commissioner, you want me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5747)|
| 1:35:56| I was just going to say I concur with Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| I think the 26th is a good date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| It gives us a week and a half, basically, after our public meeting to digest or deal with any issues that come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5761)|
| 1:36:12| I think that's a Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| That's a Thursday before Memorial Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5776)|
| 1:36:22| I need to check on the availability of the room, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5782)|
| 1:36:29| We don't own this thing 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5789)|
| 1:36:35| What we have before us as suggestions is that we will receive the budget May 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5795)|
| 1:36:41| We will have the public hearing the Monday after the work session, May 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5801)|
| 1:36:49| And we have two possible dates of approval, May 23rd or May 26th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5809)|
| 1:36:58| which will allow people to plan and block those dates as may be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5818)|
| 1:37:06| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| Last year during the process, you had asked if the Finance Committee or suggested maybe that the Finance Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5829)|
| 1:37:15| should have met more leading up to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| I just want to put it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| If anybody thinks that, wants to do that, let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5839)|
| 1:37:23| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| I would just say instead of before we lock down a date, I would like for all of us to at least get the Chairman some leeway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5846)|
| 1:37:33| give us options because he may find that the room is taken or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5853)|
| 1:37:37| bring us the options that he feels are best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5857)|
| 1:37:42| If we do some decision making at the next meeting of Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5862)|
| 1:37:47| I believe that gives us more than two months of lead time to solve any problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5867)|
| 1:37:52| I just want it to be on everyone's radar so that we can have as good of attendance as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5872)|
| 1:37:59| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5880)|
| 1:38:01| Chris, is there any way that the Mayor could do his on the 2nd or the 3rd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5881)|
| 1:38:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5887)|
| 1:38:08| We have checked his calendar and the 9th is the day that we select.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5888)|
| 1:38:15| Commissioner Brown, continuing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5895)|
| 1:38:21| Yeah, I'm trying to work 10 days in there somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5901)|
| 1:38:26| We've got a lot more information before us now than we had when we started 10 minutes or so ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5906)|
| 1:38:34| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| Okay, I'm trying to get this in my mind right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5916)|
| 1:38:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| On the 9th, the Mayor will give us, if the room's available, the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5923)|
| 1:38:50| The room is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5930)|
| 1:38:51| That date is locked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| Okay, the date's locked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| And we have a normal time of, what, 10 days to discuss it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5935)|
| 1:39:02| We will have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| Tentatively, we will have a discussion after the work session on the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5945)|
| 1:39:11| Public hearing, excuse me, public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5951)|
| 1:39:14| So that gives us seven days to look at it and then discuss it on the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5954)|
| 1:39:22| Then it will come before the County Commission when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| Either in the regular session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| Which will be the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| Or the 26th at a called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5971)|
| 1:39:34| At a called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| Okay, what would cause it to not go the 23rd except to the 26th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5977)|
| 1:39:43| The consensus of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5983)|
| 1:39:47| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5989)|
| 1:39:50| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5990)|
| 1:39:51| I think it's important for the commissioners that haven't been through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5991)|
| 1:39:55| Anybody not been through the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| Everybody's been through the process, haven't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| I mean, I think it's important that you engage with Chris in the conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6001)|
| 1:40:05| and not be surprised to a certain extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6005)|
| 1:40:08| You shouldn't be surprised whenever the Mayor presents the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| other than just what projects made the cut and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6011)|
| 1:40:15| Your engagement with Chris in conversations should lead you to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6015)|
| 1:40:19| where everything's going to land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| The guy's pretty honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| I've been called worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6024)|
| 1:40:27| I would say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6027)|
| 1:40:28| I went to school board Wednesday, if you have not heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6028)|
| 1:40:32| and went over revenue projections for FY17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6032)|
| 1:40:37| We're always in discussions with Dr. McIntyre and Bob Thomas at schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6037)|
| 1:40:42| about where we're trying to get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| and what we think we're going to get to from a projection standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6044)|
| 1:40:48| whether it's sales tax, local option sales tax, property tax, and BEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6048)|
| 1:40:55| The number I took to school board was 451.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6055)|
| 1:41:00| That is, if you just do a budget to budget, that's about 13 more than a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6060)|
| 1:41:07| You've got to take $3 million off from that, from the 438, because that was one-time money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6067)|
| 1:41:12| So really it's growth of 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6072)|
| 1:41:16| Dr. McIntyre is twisting my arm to get to 452.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6076)|
| 1:41:21| Listen, I'll tell you, sales tax is really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6081)|
| 1:41:24| I mean, sales tax is really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| BEP looks really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| Property tax is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6089)|
| 1:41:33| I never bring to you a budget that is flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6093)|
| 1:41:35| So go ahead and put that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6095)|
| 1:41:36| I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6096)|
| 1:41:39| The mayor is working with the superintendent on this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6099)|
| 1:41:44| I think the number that he would like us to get to is in reach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6104)|
| 1:41:49| I mean, we're close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6109)|
| 1:41:51| There's a lot of things that go into the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| We don't even look at all the expenditures that our departments have sent us as far as the general government yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6113)|
| 1:42:02| I'm sure they're well within reason, and I'm sure there's no bloating of expenditures there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6122)|
| 1:42:07| I guarantee it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| I'm kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6130)|
| 1:42:11| Trust me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6131)|
| 1:42:12| It'll be big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| But I think with the revenue growth that we have seen so far to date, so long as there's nothing that unforeseen happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6134)|
| 1:42:23| I think it can be a good year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6143)|
| 1:42:28| I think it's just wait and see, and we'll keep everybody abreast of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6148)|
| 1:42:35| I just wanted you all to know the conversation that I had with school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6155)|
| 1:42:39| and the number that I had given them from a projection standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6159)|
| 1:42:43| they, of course, were trying to pin me down to say it won't be any worse than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6163)|
| 1:42:48| And I said, well, if it is, I'll come back and talk to you then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| But as of now, every month that we get sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6171)|
| 1:42:55| schools gets better and better as far as over-collections from a budgetary standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6175)|
| 1:43:03| I can't say the same thing about engineering a public works or general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6183)|
| 1:43:07| Those do not look good right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| but a lot of that's because of a $1.7 million correction to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6189)|
| 1:43:17| And I would say this, during the budget process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6197)|
| 1:43:20| which we'll probably start in earnest as far as looking at budget adjustments next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6200)|
| 1:43:27| any time you all have a question or a concern, just call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6207)|
| 1:43:32| I promise you I'm probably in what we call our budget war room, just making cuts usually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6212)|
| 1:43:39| And I'm happy to meet with any of you and go over anything and show you where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6219)|
| 1:43:45| We know that we're going to have an increase in health insurance this year on the employer side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6225)|
| 1:43:51| We want to try to include some sort of a raise for employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6231)|
| 1:43:54| but we have to go through all that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| It's a process, and we enjoy what we do, although we can be kind of crazy at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6237)|
| 1:44:04| But feel free to call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| I know you probably all have my cell number, so it's probably the easiest way to reach me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| But I just wanted to say that as far as from a school funding standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6250)|
| 1:44:15| I mean, we're close, and so we'll see how we end the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6255)|
| 1:44:22| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6264)|
| 1:44:27| You had forwarded me something on the blended BEP formula that the state's come out with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6267)|
| 1:44:35| and in that the state had estimated $13 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6275)|
| 1:44:39| $13.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6279)|
| 1:44:40| And I think when you presented to the school board, you used $11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6280)|
| 1:44:44| Did you use $11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| $11.459 to be exact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6286)|
| 1:44:49| Okay, was that your estimate on the less than 1% growth effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6289)|
| 1:44:54| I'll tell you what it came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| I put numbers in a hat and drew one out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| We had got that number, and Dr. McIntyre is well aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6302)|
| 1:45:08| Bob Thomas has a way he calculates BEP and has for a number of years, and he uses an average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6308)|
| 1:45:14| And his average after the governor gave his speech was about 9.7, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6314)|
| 1:45:21| We get this letter from the state, and it says it's 13.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6321)|
| 1:45:25| So Dr. McIntyre and myself had a great conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| and we used this great idea and this formula and said, let's just half it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6328)|
| 1:45:35| Just throw a number in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| They throw 11.59, so it's just an average of the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| Because the 13.2 includes two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6340)|
| 1:45:44| One is 1% growth in attendance, and I think we're at about .4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6344)|
| 1:45:49| and so we're not going to get to 1% probably, so that will have a little bit of a reduction there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6349)|
| 1:45:54| But a lot of that formula is because they're changing the formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6354)|
| 1:46:00| Dr. McIntyre and myself had a conversation with Representative Harry Brooks Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6360)|
| 1:46:07| and it's changing the formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6367)|
| 1:46:09| It's taking a teacher salary on that calculation from $33,000 to $43,000, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6369)|
| 1:46:17| and there's some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| So that's why our number jumped to 13.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6379)|
| 1:46:23| I think we'll be close to 13.2, but we won't get our first estimate from the state until April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6383)|
| 1:46:34| So it's well after he's given his budget presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6394)|
| 1:46:37| and it's really when ours is almost done, ready to present to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6397)|
| 1:46:42| We just took a number, so that's how I got to the 451.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6402)|
| 1:46:47| The number we used there was 11.5, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6407)|
| 1:46:51| Do you know if the state, when they were projecting that BEP amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| if they assumed a 1% growth for all systems statewide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6415)|
| 1:46:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6418)|
| 1:46:59| So could some of that be spread back even?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6419)|
| 1:47:03| It could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6423)|
| 1:47:04| I think if anybody can explain it as far as how they're going to do it, we'd all be better off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6424)|
| 1:47:14| I think it's fair to say, and I said this to the school board, we've been on both sides of the coin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6434)|
| 1:47:21| We projected BEP for this current fiscal year to be 181.4, I mean 181.7, and they hit 183.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6441)|
| 1:47:33| I mean as far as our projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6453)|
| 1:47:36| Two years ago it went the other way by about $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6456)|
| 1:47:39| I'd rather be where we are conservative than I would be trying to find money to make up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6459)|
| 1:47:45| That number, and we can share it with you, that number from April to August will jump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6465)|
| 1:47:52| I mean it fluctuates, and it's scary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| because if you have projected high and it comes in low on that last one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6474)|
| 1:48:01| we're going to have to find something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| And so I think we will probably err on the side of caution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6483)|
| 1:48:07| but let's see what that number comes in on in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6487)|
| 1:48:14| I think 11.5 is really a good number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6494)|
| 1:48:17| And I know it wasn't really an educated guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6497)|
| 1:48:22| It's just because 13.2 is a big jump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6502)|
| 1:48:27| Shelbyville got 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6507)|
| 1:48:30| Shelby County got 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| 26 for Shelby County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6513)|
| 1:48:34| They get 12% of the pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| We were second in the state in the increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| We were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6518)|
| 1:48:39| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6519)|
| 1:48:40| Hopefully the number jumps to 12.2, and that way Dr. McIntyre's got his extra million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6520)|
| 1:48:47| My fellow commissioners, what I'm trying to do is set a play date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6527)|
| 1:48:51| and this is what happens when you let an accountant and an engineer get into a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6531)|
| 1:48:59| We have the dates sort of before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6539)|
| 1:49:02| If we could move on, we've got a couple more discussion items before zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6542)|
| 1:49:08| The joint education committee discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6548)|
| 1:49:11| Commissioner Orenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| Sam asked me to fill in for him, so I'm going to try my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6555)|
| 1:49:20| We met a couple weeks ago, actually, and vouchers was actually on our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6560)|
| 1:49:32| This was when it was hot and heavy and being debated and it might have been passed or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6572)|
| 1:49:38| We decided as a joint education committee that we would send a letter from basically both bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6578)|
| 1:49:45| saying that we do not support vouchers or they take away funding from us locally, blah, blah, blah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6585)|
| 1:49:55| because the board had already voted 8-1 not to support vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6595)|
| 1:50:03| Luckily that thing got tabled, but this is a discussion that we are going to continue to take up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6603)|
| 1:50:12| and be more formal when we come back to the body, our perspective bodies, to what we've decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6612)|
| 1:50:23| We've agreed that we're going to continue to meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6623)|
| 1:50:26| but we probably will not meet until May after the budget gets down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6626)|
| 1:50:31| because there's just too much going on to try to hammer stuff out during that time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6631)|
| 1:50:39| We all agreed that the two bodies meeting on this committee has been very productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6639)|
| 1:50:48| We've been able to talk through some issues and find the common grounds on all of us on both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6648)|
| 1:50:54| so it's been very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6654)|
| 1:50:58| I think Ms. Bowne sits on that committee as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6658)|
| 1:51:02| I think it's been very good to see the different perspectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| and hear the different perspectives from each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6665)|
| 1:51:10| So that's pretty much what we discussed last month was vouchers ate up most of the time of our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6670)|
| 1:51:23| Let me reiterate, as of the last three items that we've had here for discussion, school vouchers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6683)|
| 1:51:31| the budgeting process, which then began to speak of money, and the joint education committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6691)|
| 1:51:38| I appreciate Board of Education member Patty Bowne being here to hear what we have said personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6698)|
| 1:51:44| Dr. McIntyre is also present this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6704)|
| 1:51:46| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre, for being here, accompanied by Dr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6706)|
| 1:51:50| And, Dr. Davis, I do not have a question for you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6710)|
| 1:51:56| Seeing no further discussion of these items, we're moving to the last discussion item that was added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6716)|
| 1:52:02| which is about the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6722)|
| 1:52:06| That item, the Development Corporation, I attended the Development Corporation meeting this past week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6726)|
| 1:52:16| and I want to make sure that the other two members that attended with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6736)|
| 1:52:22| have a little bit of discussion with you about the Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6742)|
| 1:52:26| and their policies as it concerns real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6746)|
| 1:52:32| A couple of months ago, the Development Corporation had before it a discussion of a very small track in West Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6752)|
| 1:52:42| which at some point in time had been brought onto the Development Corporation's roles, assets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6762)|
| 1:52:51| as a tentative place to site a daycare center that would then assist parents working in that particular site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6771)|
| 1:53:07| industry located in that industrial park, with daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6787)|
| 1:53:16| That was some many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6796)|
| 1:53:20| It's been determined that this may not be a setting or site or appropriate business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6800)|
| 1:53:29| for the Development Corporation to try to get someone to come and take on that particular activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6809)|
| 1:53:37| So it was before the Board of Directors of the Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| that maybe the board would divest itself of that three or four acre parcel of ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6820)|
| 1:53:50| After some discussion, that's what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6830)|
| 1:53:55| There was an appraisal of the value of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6835)|
| 1:54:00| I believe it came back saying $50,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6840)|
| 1:54:05| and it was then approved that the Development Corporation place that particular site up for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6845)|
| 1:54:19| Now, that is a single item issue for which I thought to be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6859)|
| 1:54:26| We have had before us tonight a site that was purchased by Knox County as a school site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6866)|
| 1:54:34| which has been determined to be surplus, and we're selling it to get it on the tax roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6874)|
| 1:54:39| Here is another piece of property that's being held by the Development Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6879)|
| 1:54:44| which the Development Corporation will now attempt to return through a regular placement sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6884)|
| 1:54:54| and return it to the property tax roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6894)|
| 1:54:58| Is it the opinion of the Board of Commissioners here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6898)|
| 1:55:02| that the appropriate action has been conveyed by this body to the Development Corporation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6902)|
| 1:55:08| I'm just asking for an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6908)|
| 1:55:12| I thought it to be proper, but I want to make sure that you all agree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6912)|
| 1:55:18| Could you restate it? I'm not exactly sure what we're telling them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| This is a piece of property in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6922)|
| 1:55:25| It was located close to an industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6925)|
| 1:55:29| I'm familiar with the property, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6929)|
| 1:55:32| The lay of the land was not really conducive to anything other than a small business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6932)|
| 1:55:44| and the Development Corporation had the property appraised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6944)|
| 1:55:48| The appraisal is back, and they are now in the process of trying to sell that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6948)|
| 1:55:55| What I think is that the Development Corporation is charged to find industry and businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6955)|
| 1:56:02| to help this community grow in jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6962)|
| 1:56:05| By purchasing property and then developing that property and moving people in is the thing they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6965)|
| 1:56:13| In some instances, you have these people who want to move across town, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6973)|
| 1:56:20| If you could hold that thought with me just for a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6980)|
| 1:56:23| because this was an action of two months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6983)|
| 1:56:27| We will move into an action that just occurred, Development Corporation, at this past meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6987)|
| 1:56:32| You know where I'm headed to, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6992)|
| 1:56:36| Any other questions about this small parcel sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=6996)|
| 1:56:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7001)|
| 1:56:42| Okay. Commissioner Owenby, I'll start on this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7002)|
| 1:56:46| Where's this parcel at? I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7006)|
| 1:56:50| Ed may know, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7010)|
| 1:56:53| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7013)|
| 1:56:54| No, it's not a secret. It's at one of the industrial parks in West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7014)|
| 1:56:58| So they're putting it on the rolls and selling it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| Yes, all we're doing is as board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7020)|
| 1:57:05| And they've already voted on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7025)|
| 1:57:07| We have already voted on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| because it's difficult to get the items of the Development Corporation into our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7029)|
| 1:57:20| and I wanted to make sure that the flavor of commission is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7040)|
| 1:57:24| that we have probably acted in the best interest of Knox County and Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7044)|
| 1:57:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7052)|
| 1:57:33| Ed, where's the property located?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7053)|
| 1:57:35| It's in West Knox County, around Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7055)|
| 1:57:37| But the thing about it is, see, we voted on it at the Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7057)|
| 1:57:40| without knowing the name of the company and what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7060)|
| 1:57:43| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7063)|
| 1:57:44| This is a secret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7064)|
| 1:57:46| This is two months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7066)|
| 1:57:49| Okay, I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7069)|
| 1:57:50| This is two months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7070)|
| 1:57:52| That would be you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7072)|
| 1:57:54| Where is the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7074)|
| 1:57:55| At the corner of some road and some road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7075)|
| 1:57:58| It does not fit in the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| What is the property zoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7080)|
| 1:58:01| What's it zoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7081)|
| 1:58:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| It's a done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| I know, I'm just kind of curious as to why three or four acres in West Knox is only worth $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7086)|
| 1:58:12| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7092)|
| 1:58:13| What was your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| I'm just kind of curious as to why three or four acres in West Knox County is only worth $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7095)|
| 1:58:20| $50,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7100)|
| 1:58:21| It's got a drainage issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7101)|
| 1:58:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7103)|
| 1:58:24| That's why I want to know so I can look it up on GPS and get an idea of what we're looking at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7104)|
| 1:58:34| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7114)|
| 1:58:36| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7116)|
| 1:58:37| You said the appraisal was $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7117)|
| 1:58:39| What are they asking for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7119)|
| 1:58:42| $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7122)|
| 1:58:44| I'm kind of like Randy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7124)|
| 1:58:48| That much acreage, if it's got a 50-degree slope in West Knox County, you'd be going for more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7128)|
| 1:58:57| So how big of a drainage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7137)|
| 1:59:00| Are we talking half of the piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7140)|
| 1:59:01| I mean, how much can be used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7141)|
| 1:59:05| So it's already a moot point now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7145)|
| 1:59:07| It's already been sold, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7147)|
| 1:59:08| No, the real estate's not been sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7148)|
| 1:59:11| If you wish your commissioners that are members of the Development Corporation to go back and bring a motion to act in a different fashion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7151)|
| 1:59:21| that's the reason we're having this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7161)|
| 1:59:29| I don't think we know enough about it to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7173)|
| 1:59:34| When this money was originally appropriated by the Development Corporation, it was to buy land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7174)|
| 1:59:41| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7181)|
| 1:59:42| That's correct, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7182)|
| 1:59:43| Now we sell that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| How much did we buy it for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7185)|
| 1:59:50| How much was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7190)|
| 1:59:51| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7191)|
| 1:59:52| Before my time, before our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7192)|
| 1:59:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7196)|
| 1:59:57| Now you resell the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| Does it go back into the funding of rebuying land for future use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7199)|
| 2:00:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7205)|
| 2:00:06| Is that where it's going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7206)|
| 2:00:07| That's funds maintained by the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7210)|
| 2:00:11| So it goes back into funds that will buy future property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7211)|
| 2:00:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7214)|
| 2:00:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7215)|
| 2:00:17| Commissioner Thomas first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7217)|
| 2:00:18| I just want to quickly add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7218)|
| 2:00:20| I sat in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7220)|
| 2:00:21| The Development Board, this piece of property was not very developable at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7221)|
| 2:00:25| It had, like you said, drainage problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7225)|
| 2:00:28| It was on the back end of the industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| And there was a, somebody else had a daycare in the back there, and they wanted the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7230)|
| 2:00:35| And nobody was going to, that was nothing, it was not going to be used for anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7235)|
| 2:00:39| So we decided you might as well divest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7239)|
| 2:00:42| And that went back into the fund of the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7242)|
| 2:00:46| As long as it's something we didn't pay $100,000 for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7246)|
| 2:00:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7253)|
| 2:00:54| This covers one particular action of the Development Corporation a couple of months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7254)|
| 2:01:01| In this past meeting of the Development Corporation, we received information which I'll have to tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7261)|
| 2:01:14| we don't know what's going on either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7274)|
| 2:01:16| And the reason we, Knox County Commission, have funded the Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7276)|
| 2:01:24| is to act in our best interest without having to be a sunshined organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7284)|
| 2:01:31| We've hired them to go be our agent and deal with bringing jobs to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7291)|
| 2:01:39| by assembling appropriate tracts of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7299)|
| 2:01:43| The question that came before the Development Corporation at this last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7303)|
| 2:01:48| dealt with a prospective buyer approaching the Development Corporation to purchase a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7308)|
| 2:01:59| And there's two or three things here that need to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7319)|
| 2:02:03| First is the policy of the Development Corporation is to bring jobs to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7323)|
| 2:02:10| of a certain number and of a certain pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7330)|
| 2:02:18| That balance is against the Development Corporation is not a real estate agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7338)|
| 2:02:26| Their charge is not to sell real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7346)|
| 2:02:30| Their charge by policy is to bring businesses to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7350)|
| 2:02:38| that will have a certain number per acre and of a certain wage range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7358)|
| 2:02:47| The question that was asked of the board of the Development Corporation this past meeting was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7367)|
| 2:02:55| we have an offer which may not even be for asking value of a piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7375)|
| 2:03:02| but it does not meet the other criteria of providing a significant number of jobs per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7382)|
| 2:03:14| Number of jobs is one thing and dollar value is another thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7394)|
| 2:03:19| So the offer didn't meet the policy of the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7399)|
| 2:03:27| And it was my opinion and I believe the opinion of the other commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7407)|
| 2:03:30| that you have seated on that board was it didn't meet the policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7410)|
| 2:03:35| so we did not offer to support the sale of that piece of real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7415)|
| 2:03:46| Now, I believe that in both of these actions that members of the Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7426)|
| 2:03:54| who are also county commissioners acted in the best interest of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7434)|
| 2:03:59| And I just bring that to you as information as a result of those two meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7439)|
| 2:04:06| one two months ago and another this past meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7446)|
| 2:04:11| Now then, Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7451)|
| 2:04:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7453)|
| 2:04:17| You know, we were in the zonings, I don't know if it was the last month or month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7457)|
| 2:04:21| before we were talking about a piece of property out on the Pellissippi Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7461)|
| 2:04:24| and I was talking to commission about the Technology Corridor Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7464)|
| 2:04:30| and what they voted about that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7470)|
| 2:04:32| The difference here is that that was privately owned property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7472)|
| 2:04:36| and this is publicly owned property as the Development Corporation owns this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7476)|
| 2:04:40| and it's in an industrial development park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7480)|
| 2:04:46| There are so few places that we have until the other property comes online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7486)|
| 2:04:53| and I'm talking about Midway and other like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7493)|
| 2:04:56| where you have property that you can offer to someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7496)|
| 2:04:58| There are so few available in Knox County that you really have to weigh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7498)|
| 2:05:03| is this just going to add 30 jobs to the roll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7503)|
| 2:05:06| or is somebody waiting around the corner that's going to show up next week and give us 300 jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7506)|
| 2:05:11| And I think that's what you're, you know, because you only have so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7511)|
| 2:05:14| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7514)|
| 2:05:15| That's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7515)|
| 2:05:16| And that's how we made that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7516)|
| 2:05:17| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7517)|
| 2:05:18| Commissioner Smith, we have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7518)|
| 2:05:23| I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7523)|
| 2:05:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7526)|
| 2:05:27| I had lunch with Mr. Todd the other day, and I think you all made the correct decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7527)|
| 2:05:35| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7535)|
| 2:05:37| You're yielding your two minutes to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7537)|
| 2:05:41| Is there anything else to come before the Board of Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7541)|

| 2:05:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7549)|
| 2:05:50| I just wanted to recognize Amy Nolan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7550)|
| 2:05:53| Would you stand up for just a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7553)|
| 2:05:55| She's the new vice president of public policy for the Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7555)|
| 2:06:00| So would you join me in welcoming her to her new position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7560)|
| 2:06:08| So we'll see a lot of her lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7568)|

| 2:06:36| So you do not want to go stand in line at general election, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7596)|
| 2:06:42| If there is no further business to come before the Board of Commissioners, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7602)|

| 2:07:27| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7647)|

| 2:07:29| is the regular zoning meeting of the Board of Commissioners of Knox County for February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7649)|
| 2:07:37| Madam Clerk, would you please read the first item? The first item is on page 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7657)|
| 2:07:43| It's 1-A-16-SNC, request of Knox County Engineering, Jim Snowden, for a street name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7663)|
| 2:07:50| change from unnamed right-of-way to Sloan Lane between Nubbin Ridge Road and Terminus of Asphalt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7670)|
| 2:07:56| in the 4th Commission District. Mr. Green, would you check that microphone? Does that microphone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7676)|
| 2:08:03| work at that seat? Yes, sir. Please have a seat. You may, there's no need to spring up and down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7683)|
| 2:08:11| and we don't want to get away and we don't want to get in the way of John King or Arthur Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7691)|
| 2:08:17| So, the recommendation of MPC. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission. Gerald| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7697)|
| 2:08:26| Green, Director of MPC. MPC and the Knox County Engineering Department request that this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7706)|
| 2:08:33| be delayed or deferred until next month to enable us to obtain additional signatures on the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7713)|
| 2:08:39| form. So, move. So, we have before us a motion properly second to delay defer till next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7719)|
| 2:08:51| Yes, sir. Till our next meeting of the Board of Zoning. All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7731)|
| 2:09:01| The motion carries. Mr. Snowden, can I ask you one question before you go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7741)|
| 2:09:08| Is it possible you could get us a list of what your paving proposals are for this coming budget year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7748)|
| 2:09:19| Yes, we're actually putting that list together right now. Are you saying the list that we pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7759)|
| 2:09:24| prior to the fiscal year or the next fiscal year? That you're going to start on here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7764)|
| 2:09:28| soon, March 1st. Yes, I'll get you that. That information is available. I'll email it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7768)|
| 2:09:32| to you directly. If anybody else wants to just let me know. Why don't you send it to all of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7772)|
| 2:09:38| Yeah, I'll send it to Jolie and she'll send it to all of us. Whichever way you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7778)|
| 2:09:43| Thank you, Mr. Snowden. Madam Clerk. Page 14. First item is 10-B-15-SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7783)|
| 2:09:52| Request of Jane Sternberg for North County Sector Plan Amendment from LDR Low Density Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7792)|
| 2:09:57| MUCC Mixed Use Community Commercial with SP Stream Protection and HP Hillside Protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7797)|
| 2:10:04| to GC General Commercial with SP Stream Protection and HP Hillside Protection. The property is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7804)|
| 2:10:10| located southeast side of West Emory Road, southwest of Central Avenue Pike in the 7th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7810)|
| 2:10:16| Commission District. Is the applicant here? Yes, sir. Is that you, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7816)|
| 2:10:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm John King, PO Box 2425 Knoxville, Tennessee, here on behalf of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7824)|
| 2:10:31| applicant. There is a there's a proposal. Is there opposition? Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7831)|
| 2:10:43| Excuse me, Mr. King, you may continue. Okay, as I was saying, there's an accompanying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7843)|
| 2:10:50| request for rezoning of this property, which would occur or be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7850)|
| 2:11:02| subsequent to action on the on the sector plan. What what happened at MPC was after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7862)|
| 2:11:15| what happened at MPC was after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7875)|
| 2:11:20| protracted discussion. The the outcome was that they did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7880)|
| 2:11:31| recommend the plan amendment that we asked for. It was their recommendation to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7891)|
| 2:11:43| amend a portion of the property not already CC in designation to CC, and then they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7903)|
| 2:11:56| rezoned the property to plan commercial instead of our request to CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7916)|
| 2:12:07| What what has to happen in order for this body to properly consider the request for rezoning is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7927)|
| 2:12:14| that the that the plan amendment has to be initiated by this body back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7934)|
| 2:12:23| for them to act upon that, and then once they do, it then comes back in front of this body to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7943)|
| 2:12:29| comes back in front of this body to be considered. At the same time, the rezoning request would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7949)|
| 2:12:37| be postponed until that occurred, and then you would have both the rezoning and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7957)|
| 2:12:44| plan amendment back in front of you at that time. With that explanation, I thought I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7964)|
| 2:12:52| talk just a little bit about the rezoning, and then I will be asking for a motion on the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7972)|
| 2:13:00| amendment, and I'll cover that when I get to it. But first of all, I wanted to talk about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7980)|
| 2:13:07| property just a little bit. It's been owned by Dr. Sternberg for a number of years. Back in about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7987)|
| 2:13:15| 2005, he and Mark Carberry, a former employee of MPC, got together, and Mark Carberry was working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=7995)|
| 2:13:24| very hard on the TC town center zoning, and he talked to Dr. Sternberg about trying out that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8004)|
| 2:13:35| if you will, that zoning classification. I participated at the time in getting the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8015)|
| 2:13:42| rezoned to TC. It's now been 10 years, and we haven't been able to do anything with the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8022)|
| 2:13:51| and that was the reason for the request to go to CA. The planned commercial recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8031)|
| 2:14:00| by MPC is another planned classification, and we haven't had anybody as a developer come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8040)|
| 2:14:11| and want to take on this approximately 37 acres, 35 or so acres, and do a planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8051)|
| 2:14:22| He's had some rather strong interest on the part of one restaurant developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8062)|
| 2:14:30| and we're not talking about a fast food place but a real sort of a sit-down family type restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8070)|
| 2:14:38| There are some points that I think I could make rather quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8078)|
| 2:14:47| Part of the reasoning was they were somewhat concerned about some property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8087)|
| 2:14:54| that now is basically covered on three sides by this zoning, and that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8094)|
| 2:15:08| the property in this area right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8108)|
| 2:15:21| The rezoning and the planned development covers all of this property right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8121)|
| 2:15:25| and up through here, and there was concern about these three parcels. Actually, I think it's more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8125)|
| 2:15:34| like six parcels being sort of surrounded by this commercial development. One of those parcels is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8134)|
| 2:15:45| kind of historical in the way of it, and Dr. Sternberg's wife is using that property now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8145)|
| 2:15:51| and it is not in residential use. Next to it is another residential building not utilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8151)|
| 2:16:00| for residential purposes. Dr. Sternberg has a private personal refusal on that piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8160)|
| 2:16:08| Then there was another piece that was used as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8168)|
| 2:16:16| as a home business use, but that particular person is no longer living in that facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8176)|
| 2:16:26| so I'm not sure what the status is. That was a psychologist. There are only two pieces of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8186)|
| 2:16:32| in there that Dr. Sternberg, if you will, doesn't own and are not really sort of covered by his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8192)|
| 2:16:42| situation, and those two pieces of property are looking to sell but waiting until this zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8202)|
| 2:16:52| is over, so to speak, before they are willing to start actively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8212)|
| 2:17:00| participating in selling their property. Now, the reasons for that rezoning, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8220)|
| 2:17:11| I went through the ordinance from sort of from top to bottom with Dr. Sternberg, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8231)|
| 2:17:20| this is the zoning classification that we concluded can best offer an opportunity for him to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8240)|
| 2:17:28| do something with the property. I got to get back up here to my map again. I tried to speak up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8248)|
| 2:17:37| What happens is we do not get coverage for those people that are watching on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8257)|
| 2:17:50| The way things have developed out there, there were some discussions about, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8270)|
| 2:17:57| commercial development ought to go toward the development node, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8277)|
| 2:18:07| and, oh, there you go, and so in looking at that, I wanted to remind us all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8287)|
| 2:18:17| here's the interstate, and starting off the interstate coming westward along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8297)|
| 2:18:24| West Emory Road, this sort of purple piece, this piece here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8304)|
| 2:18:33| on the south side is all the new Kroger development at the old airfield, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8313)|
| 2:18:42| and that goes all the way through to here and may come over into this property, which is zone CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8322)|
| 2:18:53| I don't know whether you can recall, but all of this on the north side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8333)|
| 2:18:57| is developed all the way down with, there's a Waffle House, there's some other, shall we say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8337)|
| 2:19:06| 7-11 type operations and a number of different things. Home Federal is here, there's another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8346)|
| 2:19:13| bank on this other corner over here, so everything from the interstate all the way down to right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8353)|
| 2:19:20| there is commercial development, and it's underway. Kroger has some listed potentials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8360)|
| 2:19:30| joining them in that in their location of entities like Academy Sports, Coles, Petco,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8370)|
| 2:19:39| those kind of things. After you cross Central Avenue Pike, as I say, this is CA here with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8379)|
| 2:19:47| businesses. This particular piece, zoned PR, is at 19 dwelling units per acre, and you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8387)|
| 2:19:55| there's been an approved apartment complex to be built there, some 220 apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8395)|
| 2:20:04| The next piece of property is owned by Dr. Collier, and if you'll note, a large portion of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8404)|
| 2:20:15| is in the floodway going that way. This is property given or acquired by the county for the library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8415)|
| 2:20:26| and then he has given, or the county acquired by a friendly transaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8426)|
| 2:20:36| this property here, and he either has or is in the process of giving the remainder of that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8436)|
| 2:20:49| a large part of which is inside the floodway, but he's giving that to Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8449)|
| 2:20:56| The next piece of property is ours, and as I said, we haven't been able to do anything with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8456)|
| 2:21:05| for 10 years. We're now on, I believe it's the fourth, third or fourth real estate company to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8465)|
| 2:21:13| assist us in marketing this property. It was done TC, and at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8473)|
| 2:21:25| rezoned, and the plan was amended to permit that rezoning. There are only two parcels of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8485)|
| 2:21:34| in the county that are TC, this piece and the piece that's at North Shore and Pellissippi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8494)|
| 2:21:41| Parkway. Needless to say, TC has had its problems in actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8501)|
| 2:21:53| operation, so we think there have been sufficient changes, a number of changes in this area to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8513)|
| 2:22:02| support amending the sector plan. You now have the completed five-lane roadway, West Emory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8522)|
| 2:22:13| all the way across. There's the big new Kroger Shopping Center development going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8533)|
| 2:22:21| I think they've got seven or eight what I would call out parcels fronting along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8541)|
| 2:22:28| Emory Road. The additional thing would be the apartment complex development and the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8548)|
| 2:22:42| essentially everything between the interstate and us on our side of the road is either already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8562)|
| 2:22:52| in development. So we would ask that we be given the opportunity to further present the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8572)|
| 2:22:59| rezoning case to this body, and the way we have in order to do that is to ask that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8579)|
| 2:23:09| this body initiate an application, if you will, or initiate a request for plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8589)|
| 2:23:18| for this property to go back to MPC. When they act on it, regardless of what they do, it comes back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8598)|
| 2:23:25| to them, to this body. This is all a result of some unfortunate judicial decisions that put us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8605)|
| 2:23:33| in the situation of having two things that go forward and then all of a sudden they're split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8613)|
| 2:23:40| It's an effort to figure out a way to get them back together for purposes of consideration and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8620)|
| 2:23:46| action. What I would be asking for in this instance is a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8626)|
| 2:23:59| initiate a request for a sector plan amendment to accomplish a change from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8639)|
| 2:24:11| CC designation. That's what the sector plan has on it, CC, which is community commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8651)|
| 2:24:18| That does not permit consideration of a CA zoning classification. So I would ask that we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8658)|
| 2:24:24| motion to initiate a plan amendment from CC and LDR to GC, general commercial, for all of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8664)|
| 2:24:34| property in this request lying north of the railroad tracks and refer the matter to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8674)|
| 2:24:43| for its consideration and action. If that is done, then that would go back to them and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8683)|
| 2:24:51| the rezoning request would be postponed and held until that plan amendment or requested plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8691)|
| 2:24:58| amendment came back from MPC. That having been said, I can talk more about the rezoning, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8698)|
| 2:25:11| it doesn't seem to serve the purpose here until we get the action involved in the sending back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8711)|
| 2:25:24| MPC the request for the plan amendment. It's a little bit confusing, I understand that, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8724)|
| 2:25:30| got very confusing at the MPC and they wound up, as I say, leaving CC on the part of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8730)|
| 2:25:45| that had been redone back 10 years ago or so. Then adding the additional property that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8745)|
| 2:25:55| have involved in this request and changing its designation to CC, and then they put planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8755)|
| 2:26:05| commercial on all of it to a depth of 500 feet. I'm not really sure what the idea there was, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8765)|
| 2:26:15| if you just leave it at a natural breaking point and go just down to the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8775)|
| 2:26:22| side of the railroad, there's a lot of developable property that's beyond 500 feet from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8782)|
| 2:26:29| road right away that was not included in their rezoning. So, in any event, I'm seeking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8789)|
| 2:26:39| help from this body to try to put a plan amendment and a rezoning request sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8799)|
| 2:26:46| back together so that you all at a later point in time can really consider our rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8806)|
| 2:26:55| I'll try to answer any questions. Commissioner Anders, do you have a question of the presenter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8815)|
| 2:27:00| I do. Part of this is in Star Mountain Properties LLC. Is that a family company or is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8820)|
| 2:27:08| Yes. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8828)|
| 2:27:15| And I've got us out of order. Mr. Green, I did not ask for your presentation of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8835)|
| 2:27:22| MPC. Knowing where we're headed, you may or may not wish to speak much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8842)|
| 2:27:30| I'll be brief. I think Mr. King gave a good summary of MPC recommendation with regard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8850)|
| 2:27:36| the sector plan amendment and that it would only address the western portion of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8856)|
| 2:27:41| leaving the remainder of the property as the CC mixed-use community commercial designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8861)|
| 2:27:50| There was a great, as Mr. King said, a great deal of discussion, some of it difficult to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8870)|
| 2:27:58| with regard to the reasoning. There was some concern about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8878)|
| 2:28:03| lack of control on access and the uncoordinated development that could occur on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8883)|
| 2:28:10| with the CA zoning that may reflect the lack of adequate tool to address the concerns that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8890)|
| 2:28:18| planning commissioners had with regard to zoning this CA. Again, I think Mr. King gave a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8898)|
| 2:28:25| summary of the planning commission's recommendation on this. I won't go any further with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8905)|
| 2:28:32| my presentation. If you have any questions of me, I'd be happy to answer those. Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8912)|
| 2:28:40| Mr. King, on the current zoning that you have there at TC, how many curb cuts would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8920)|
| 2:28:50| are allowed in that? I mean, somebody told me at one time there were six curb cuts that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8930)|
| 2:28:56| were planned in that TC zoning. Do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8936)|
| 2:29:03| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8943)|
| 2:29:18| On the former zoning, the TC, T as in Tom, I think there was a some sort of a limitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8958)|
| 2:29:32| maybe there were two access points or something like that. But on the currently recommended PC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8972)|
| 2:29:39| there is no restriction on the number of access points as I recall. That's correct. And there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8979)|
| 2:29:49| a this is the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=8989)|
| 2:30:00| That was the TC one, one, two. Yeah, I thought I was right on the submitted plan that had to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9000)|
| 2:30:10| with the town center rezoning. We show two access points. But as I say, with regard to what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9010)|
| 2:30:23| now the MPC's action on recommending PC, P as in Paul, there is no current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9023)|
| 2:30:37| restriction in place as to the number. Obviously, we would have to, if that was what we wound up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9037)|
| 2:30:44| getting, which obviously we don't want, but you would have to submit a plan and go through a use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9044)|
| 2:30:51| on review process. And I'm sure the number of access points would be discussed at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9051)|
| 2:30:58| I don't think you're going to find us having an excessive number of access points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9058)|
| 2:31:07| We've currently we have one, which is likewise the driveway, but I believe it may even be named| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9067)|
| 2:31:15| a road at this point into Dr. Sternberg's existing business location there, veterinary clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9075)|
| 2:31:28| The main issue that I hope you take in consideration here is around the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9088)|
| 2:31:35| exit there at 112. You have a lot of curb cuts right there real close, which causes a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9095)|
| 2:31:41| there. And I know Dr. Sternberg is a longtime resident out there and is a good neighbor out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9101)|
| 2:31:46| there. So I'm going to make a recommendation that the county commission initiate a plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9106)|
| 2:31:56| from CC and LDR to GC for all the property that is lying north of the railroad tracks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9116)|
| 2:32:05| and refer to the matter to MPC for consideration of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9125)|
| 2:32:12| That's in the form of a motion. Yes. Thank you. Commissioner Brown. Question. You got a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9132)|
| 2:32:20| You say it is all properties north of the railroad track. I got a whole bunch of them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9140)|
| 2:32:28| How many of them are we talking? These are we talking about? It's just this right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9148)|
| 2:32:32| All the properties in this. He's talking about the purple up here. So we're all the properties that are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9152)|
| 2:32:39| this request and they're numbered. I think what you'll find is that for purposes of this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9159)|
| 2:32:46| there are six properties along the frontage toward the western portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9166)|
| 2:32:55| I guess I'd call that toward the western part of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9175)|
| 2:33:00| There are six properties at front up there that would not be included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9180)|
| 2:33:10| As I say, there's a real estate office, there's a psychologist office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9190)|
| 2:33:17| there's a lawyer's office. There is a piece of property owned by Dr. Sternberg which is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9197)|
| 2:33:25| two and a half acres at the very end of our proposed rezoning. Two and a half acre piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9205)|
| 2:33:32| there that he owns. It has a house on it that is currently he's renting it but he owns it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9212)|
| 2:33:39| and he also owns the property that's being used for the real estate office and he has a right of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9219)|
| 2:33:44| first refusal on what's being operated as a lawyer's office. But those properties currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9224)|
| 2:33:53| would be the property that isn't excluded. So it goes down to Powell Drive, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9233)|
| 2:34:00| Almost. There's a triangular shaped piece on our side that's zone CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9240)|
| 2:34:12| We don't go all the way to Powell Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9252)|
| 2:34:16| Let's just do the requested area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9256)|
| 2:34:19| There are five, maybe six lots beyond our request that are already zone CB that lie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9259)|
| 2:34:30| in essence. We're just dealing with a requested area now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9270)|
| 2:34:38| I think it'd probably be proper to make the motion as requested the areas requested in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9278)|
| 2:34:45| rezoning request. That way there's no question. Nobody else gets rezoned out from under it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9285)|
| 2:34:49| I think that's what his motion said is for all the properties lying north of the railroad track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9289)|
| 2:34:56| that are included in this request and there are some that weren't included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9296)|
| 2:35:02| Right. That's why I asked the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9302)|
| 2:35:06| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9306)|
| 2:35:08| Thank you Mr. Chairman. This comment is really to Mr. Green. Back in July 2001 I was one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9308)|
| 2:35:14| handful of citizens that was involved when the town center zoning was first proposed to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9314)|
| 2:35:19| Metropolitan Planning Commission for the site as you said at the North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9319)|
| 2:35:25| And typically a town center zoning district is 200 acres or more. And back then we used examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9325)|
| 2:35:33| of the ones in Charlotte and Overland Park and Dallas areas which I'd had an opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9333)|
| 2:35:40| actually go and visit. But I was shocked when I found that this property was actually zoned at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9340)|
| 2:35:46| only 35 acres at town center zoning. I have no idea what possessed them back you know in 2005| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9346)|
| 2:35:53| with Mr. Carberry to even kind of suggest that zoning. And that's probably one of the main| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9353)|
| 2:35:59| reasons that the applicant has not been able to develop this property. So I guess going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9359)|
| 2:36:05| I hope that staff we never get into that situation where we take a very small track of land and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9365)|
| 2:36:13| designate it as town center zoning because that's not what it's designed for. It's for large acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9373)|
| 2:36:19| So anything I'm in favor of anything that would would take away the town center zoning for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9379)|
| 2:36:24| small track of land. Seeing no further discussion is properly before us that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9384)|
| 2:36:38| sector plan change be initiated by commission back to MPC. As noted in Commissioner Bussler's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9398)|
| 2:36:50| motion. Seeing no further discussion all in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed no. The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9410)|
| 2:37:00| So the zoning is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9420)|
| 2:37:06| It goes with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9426)|
| 2:37:08| It goes with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9428)|
| 2:37:10| Same motion on both problems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9430)|
| 2:37:12| We don't have to read that one right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9432)|
| 2:37:14| We don't have to read the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9434)|
| 2:37:16| We have a no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9436)|

| 2:37:37| Postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9457)|
| 2:37:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9459)|
| 2:37:41| Do we have a motion to postpone the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9461)|
| 2:37:43| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9463)|

| 2:39:49| I guess the nursing home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9589)|
| 2:39:51| next door, is it coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9591)|
| 2:39:53| and expanding there? Is that the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9593)|
| 2:39:55| We haven't spoken to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9595)|
| 2:39:57| but we feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9597)|
| 2:39:59| that they may be interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9599)|
| 2:40:01| in doing that. I know they're always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9601)|
| 2:40:03| overbooked and there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9603)|
| 2:40:05| waiting list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9605)|
| 2:40:07| So you're just hoping that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9607)|
| 2:40:09| you're getting a zone in hope that it occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9609)|
| 2:40:12| And this is just a medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9612)|
| 2:40:14| office zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9614)|
| 2:40:16| because it kind of butts up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9616)|
| 2:40:18| I'm for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9618)|
| 2:40:20| I read a lot of residential there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9620)|
| 2:40:22| This is a limited office development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9622)|

| 2:40:26| The assisted living like the nursing home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9626)|
| 2:40:28| would be permitted and one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9628)|
| 2:40:30| items that both staff and the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9630)|
| 2:40:32| saw was the proximity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9632)|
| 2:40:34| of the nursing home to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9634)|
| 2:40:36| The building itself is almost on the property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9636)|
| 2:40:38| and felt that expansion of that nursing home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9638)|
| 2:40:41| was a logical use for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9641)|
| 2:40:43| I'll make a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160222?start=9643)|
