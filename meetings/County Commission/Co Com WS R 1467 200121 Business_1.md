| 2:31:18| insurance offices, real estate offices, dental offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9078)|
| 2:31:22| It wasn't designed for full commercial like this business is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9082)|
| 2:31:27| So that's all I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9087)|
| 2:31:28| But please look at that designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9088)|
| 2:31:30| and consider how that would impact in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9090)|
| 2:31:33| all the other neighborhood commercials through Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9093)|
| 2:31:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9097)|
| 2:31:38| Amy, I'm going to make a rarely done request of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9098)|
| 2:31:41| Would you mind emailing to the Commission a link on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9101)|
| 2:31:46| There was probably a discussion at the Planning Commission meeting about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9106)|
| 2:31:49| where this came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9109)|
| 2:31:51| And just frankly, to save us a little bit of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9111)|
| 2:31:53| can you email that link to it and say about where in the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9113)|
| 2:31:57| what time point that the discussion on this item came up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9117)|
| 2:32:01| I think that might help some of the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9121)|
| 2:32:03| who have heard what you've said about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9123)|
| 2:32:04| and then what the Planning Commissioner said in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9124)|
| 2:32:06| That might just be easier to have a little bit more additional insight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9126)|
| 2:32:11| As this is an ordinance, I want to remind everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9131)|
| 2:32:14| that the proper motion is to send the reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9134)|
| 2:32:17| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9137)|
| 2:32:19| And the first reading really doesn't count| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9139)|
| 2:32:21| until we're actually at the meeting next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9141)|
| 2:32:23| So the proper motion, which I believe it's been so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9143)|
| 2:32:27| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9147)|
| 2:32:28| Yeah, we've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9148)|
| 2:32:29| Who made the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9149)|
| 2:32:32| Okay, so the motion was by Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9152)|
| 2:32:35| and seconded by Commissioner Daley to send forward no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9155)|
| 2:32:39| Seeing no other lights on this item, it's appropriate to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9159)|
| 2:32:42| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9162)|
| 2:32:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9163)|
| 2:32:44| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9164)|
| 2:32:45| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9165)|
| 2:32:46| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9166)|
| 2:32:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9167)|
| 2:32:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9168)|
| 2:32:49| Madam Clerk, just a little bit of housekeeping here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9169)|
| 2:32:52| We are getting into a long-ish meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9172)|
| 2:32:55| and we have two other brief meetings after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9175)|
| 2:32:59| One of the meetings after this is a public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9179)|
| 2:33:01| related to the sidewalk construction standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9181)|
| 2:33:04| I would prefer to have the discussion on that item during that public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9184)|
| 2:33:10| if that's all right with my fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9190)|
| 2:33:13| So just saying that, and as that is an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9193)|
| 2:33:16| the proper motion would be to send that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9196)|
| 2:33:18| which is upcoming forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9198)|
| 2:33:21| We can have the discussion during the public forum coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9201)|
| 2:33:26| because I know that this body has been meeting since 5 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9206)|
| 2:33:30| and we're going to need a break probably before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9210)|
| 2:33:33| To the members of the public who are here for those two hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9213)|
| 2:33:35| the release that announced it said that those hearings would start at 7 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9215)|
| 2:33:41| or as soon as the work session wrapped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9221)|
| 2:33:45| And I'm trying to get to a wrap-up so we can begin that important discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9225)|
| 2:33:50| Can we vote to send the rest of the agenda without recommendation in one vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9230)|
| 2:33:55| They're all ordinance or discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9235)|
| 2:33:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9238)|
| 2:33:59| Well, and the discussion items, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9239)|
| 2:34:00| we've already had at the beginning of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9240)|
| 2:34:05| So let's go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9245)|
| 2:34:07| Madam Clerk, could you read item 40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9247)|
