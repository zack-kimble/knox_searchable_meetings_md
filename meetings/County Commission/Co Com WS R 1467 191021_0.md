| 0:01:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=74)|
| 0:01:15| Ten members, and I know for the record that Commissioner Gill will officially mark her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=75)|

| 0:01:57| forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=117)|

| 0:02:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=121)|
| 0:02:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| I'll look in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| Is there any members of the public that would like to address the commission as public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=125)|
| 0:02:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=131)|
| 0:02:12| Before we move into setting tonight's agenda, I'd like for those of you who are in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=132)|
| 0:02:17| who this might be your first meeting, and for those of you who may be watching from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=137)|
| 0:02:21| home, every month the County Commission comes together for two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=141)|
| 0:02:26| There's a meeting usually the third Monday of the month, which is this one, our work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=146)|
| 0:02:30| session, and there's another follow-up meeting, which is our official Board of Commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=150)|
| 0:02:34| meeting, which takes place on the fourth Monday of each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=154)|
| 0:02:40| The purpose of today's meeting, it's considered a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| We are going to take a first walk through our agenda of items that we are tasked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| work with on this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=168)|
| 0:02:50| We're going to take some of these items that are, for lack of a better word, non-controversial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=170)|
| 0:02:55| or things that are a matter of routine that are going to be approved and end up placing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| them on our consent agenda, which will then be voted on next week with one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=180)|
| 0:03:06| Some items we've temporarily pulled from consent, which we'll discuss tonight, and then take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| a vote to determine whether we're going to move them forward to next week for a follow-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| discussion and a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| Some items will just be voted on tonight, and they will move on to the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=198)|
| 0:03:23| We also have some items tonight that we're going to talk about as part of a formal discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| and some items that are on tonight's agenda for discussion that we may actually end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| moving to next week to cover in the Board of Commissioners meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=211)|
| 0:03:37| So, with that said, basically, are there any amendments to tonight's agenda from what my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=217)|
| 0:03:46| fellow commissioners received?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| Yes, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| You had sent out the list of items that would not be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| I noticed on there number eight was not on that list, and we have two blanks, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=233)|
| 0:03:58| the ethics appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| That was probably an assumptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| I did not pull that from consent, but that will be pulled from consent because we've got the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| meeting tonight after this, and then those will be formally voted on next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| So, yes, thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| So, Madam Clerk, if you could clarify that item eight will be voted on next week as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=253)|
| 0:04:19| follow-up from the hearing that we'll be having tonight at 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| Yes, thank you for the catch on that, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=263)|
| 0:04:25| Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| We also have two items on tonight's agenda that have discussion related, and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| guests who are here tonight to provide insight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| That is items 38 and item 45, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| Is that correct, that we're going to move forward in the agenda so that out of respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| for the guests that we have here tonight who are here to update us on these items, we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=281)|
| 0:04:46| move them forward so that they can be discussed sooner in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| Is there any other updates or changes to tonight's agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=290)|
| 0:04:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=297)|

| 0:05:32| There was also one agenda item, which I believe it came in after the deadline, and I've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| it in here as a to be added, which is the item that the coordinating committee brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=336)|

| 0:07:44| Both the person who made the first and the second, your motion has been changed to send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| But before that, while that's on the floor, any update on this particular item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| Any additional insight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| Sherry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=476)|
| 0:07:57| If we have, yes, I just passed out those for you to, any questions that you all might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=477)|
| 0:08:04| We're very excited about this possible partnership, and yes, that's included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| Most of the questions will be answered on there, but I'm sure that there's a few more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| and I'm here to answer them if you need me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| My fellow Commissioner as well, she's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| Do you have any follow-up questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| Yes, Sherry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| Would you go ahead and explain what the process is and what we discussed about today, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=504)|
| 0:08:29| remodeling and everything, and what we may have to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| The remodeling is, we've talked to, what this is, is at East Town Crossing, and it's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=512)|
| 0:08:39| old food line, if any of you all are familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| It's not the entire food line, but a portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| We'll be increasing our square footage as well as partnering with the Trustee's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| and the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| So as far as the remodeling, what we would like to do is, we have got a proposal amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=533)|
| 0:09:01| that we're looking at that we, not to exceed, but we're trying to use inmate labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| So the Sheriff and the Trustee do not have a budget for an office right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| So what I would like to do is just, it's actually going to be less than what we're paying now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=552)|
| 0:09:18| so just continue to pay that until they are able to ask for additional funds for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=558)|
| 0:09:25| part of the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| But we're very excited about having a presence of the Trustee's Office, which we already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| have, but they just have a little corner of it, but the Sheriff as well is having that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=571)|
| 0:09:37| out in the East area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| And we've heard from a lot of your constituents and what they're asking is that we please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| keep it in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| Let me just say that there was nothing wrong with the current building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| We've had a wonderful partnership with Markman, it's just landlocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| So if you'll go out there at the end of the month or the first of the month, you will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| notice that that drive-through window does more business, that clerk out there does more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| business than anyone else in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| So the North Knox Countians are using that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| So that being said, when people are lined up in the drive-through, you can't get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=612)|
| 0:10:18| So we had to look around and try to find something else and so we went with the finance department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=618)|
| 0:10:24| and several others and looked around and we came up with this and have been working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| it for five or six months, finally got the agreement together and we've squeezed about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| as hard as we can squeeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| So we have someone here from the Grand Partnership, but anyway, they'll be here next time as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=637)|
| 0:10:43| if there's any questions that you need to know, but we just hope that we can provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| the same service that we've been doing out there in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| Did that answer your question, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| Yeah, are you prepared to say a number tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| To set a number today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| As far as the remodel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| As far as the remodeling, we're just hoping that it is not going to exceed $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=661)|
| 0:11:07| We're hoping that, well, we know we've already been, they have guesstimated as far as them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| but we will have to put that out for bid and make sure that it's not, but we have checked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| with finance on that and we're good to go on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| And that'll be in the resolution next week, so we'll have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| I want to say that I've been, I have been out there a few times and that place is awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| It really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| Every county clerk's office that I've been in, everybody's nice and respectful and helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| but Easttown out there, I was very, very impressed the very first time I went in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=699)|
| 0:11:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| I am blessed with a lot of good employees, people to work with, so I enjoy them every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| day and they really do go above and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=710)|
| 0:11:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| We've got a lot of lights on in this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| I'm going to go in order, at least that I saw, Carringer, Jay, Gill, Schoonmaker, Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| and Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| So, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| Thank you, Commissioner Daley, for those kind remarks about my District 2 county clerk's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| I can't express how excited I am about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| This is something that's much, much needed in the North Knoxville and the East area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=739)|
| 0:12:26| the greatest place to live and work, and we're just getting a great opportunity here to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=746)|
| 0:12:36| our Sheriff's Office included in this office, which we have never had the presence to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=756)|
| 0:12:43| able to have the Sheriff's Office in that particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| So, I just want to encourage all the commissioners, if you do really have any questions, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=767)|
| 0:12:54| I don't think so, because the Markman's Jewelers, which is where the clerk's office has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=774)|
| 0:13:00| for the past several, several years, is very much indeed landlocked, no parking, and hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=780)|
| 0:13:06| to get in and out of, to say the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| So, this move, I'm grateful that Graham is very interested and cares about offering the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=789)|
| 0:13:18| services the best we can for our Knox County citizens, and this is just going to be a tremendous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=798)|
| 0:13:24| asset for our district and for the clerk's office, Sheriff's Office, and Trustee's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| being able to bring our government to our communities where they don't have to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| downtown and find a place to park and pay and walk, because for our elderly, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=814)|
| 0:13:40| getting very, very, very difficult for them to find any parking around here to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=820)|
| 0:13:45| to get to meetings and do government business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| So, thank you, County Clerk, Ms. Witt, for doing this and working so well, as long as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=827)|
| 0:13:54| you're, along with your great assistant, Mr. Michaels back there, that I call him Pursuer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=834)|
| 0:14:01| Mr. Michaels was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| But anyway, thank you so much for all of you all working together to bring this to District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=842)|
| 0:14:10| 2, which I'm most proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| Ms. Witt, just a quick question, the build-up cost you estimated around $100,000, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=859)|
| 0:14:25| an appropriation that you'd be asking this body to make, or is that coming out of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| current operating budget as the clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| That would be coming out of finance, and so I'm not sure exactly if we have to, what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=872)|
| 0:14:38| going to have to do as far as coming back to you, or if we, I'm not in the habit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| coming to y'all and asking you for money, so I'm not sure exactly how that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| But that's to be determined before next week, whether it comes out of the clerk's designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| I have talked to finance about what we are turning in, what's designated where, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| feel comfortable saying that it would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| And then, quick question, one of your bullet points said you were 16.83% above forecast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| for excess fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| Do you know what that was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| What were the excess fees last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| The excess fees for last year was right under $2 million, and that's $124,000 up from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=911)|
| 0:15:18| year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| So you're above that this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| One of the questions have been answered, but what would be the monthly proposed cost is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=928)|
| 0:15:35| a little more than $6,000 in terms of the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| Is that going to be split equally between you and the Sheriff's Department, or just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| you absorbing the entire cost at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| Until their budget, until budget year, we will absorb the whole cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| Right after that, then we will equal out as far as what percentage we have of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| and the sheriff and the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| And we spoke to them about that, and they are very willing to cooperate with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| So are we looking at a bill out of a year from now, or six months from now, three months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| What is our timeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| After February, we are on a month-to-month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| So we're hoping that we can get this done as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| And I don't think that there's that plan urgency here to get it done for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| Grand Properties is on board, and they're wanting to get it done, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| I'm just trying to get everything lined up where we can start on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| This question may be, so is the remodel being done by who, and is the supplemental labor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=993)|
| 0:16:44| being done by the Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| That's what I'm trying to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| That will be bid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| I do have a suggestion about the inmate labor, that we would like to use them whenever we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| Of course, not with the electrical, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| We can't, but there's a lot of things that you can use inmate labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| And I can tell you, the clerk's office, our sheriff has been wonderful to work with as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| far as to send us inmate labor, that we've saved a lot of money in using them and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1027)|
| 0:17:14| carrying this, painting, doing things that we appreciate and get done quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| And I know that we are not acquiring the entire building, but is there an opportunity for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| additional expanded services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| Commissioner, I don't think we'll need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| We have looked at this, the square footage that we've asked for, and we have prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| for growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| Do we have the option for growth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| I think that we're good with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| Commissioner Skinmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| I have my questions answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| Are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| And Commissioner Smith, your light's off now, so is your question answered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| So I noticed, obviously, we don't have CAM fees at the new location, and, you know, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| coming in cheaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| And I really appreciate that and all your hard work that you've done here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| Can you just, you're adding some of the, some things to our taxpayers, as well as, can you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| just go over a brief description of the increase that you're projected to have with the Real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| Do you see a huge increase coming your way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| I had those numbers, actually, what we have increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| We have done, well, we're up 6 percent in revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| We are up 4.5 in transactions over last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1109)|
| 0:18:34| We have done, in the month of September, we've done 2,400 Real IDs and 3,400 regular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1114)|
| 0:18:42| Now, those are quickly increasing as the state puts out more publicity about the clerk's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1122)|
| 0:18:49| office doing those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| So we only anticipate more of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| And thanks for all your hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| And we are also, you know, we're doing several other things, too, as far as we've added a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| passport office to halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| We're doing handgun renewals and this Real ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| So our numbers are going up, and we just want room for the public to come in and be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1145)|
| 0:19:12| able to better serve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| So thank you all very much for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| Karen, did you have a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| I just wanted to reemphasize on what Commissioner Biggs said about the Real ID being offered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| at this particular location because it's not offered everywhere, and that is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| that everyone that wants to go in a federal building or fly will have to have by this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1173)|
| 0:19:39| time next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| So and also the handgun permit, that's new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| I mean, before, that entire area had to go to Straw Plains was pretty much the closest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| So, yeah, you all have added a lot more services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| We're taking on new services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| So that's a definite increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| So thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| Appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| But just a second, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| This started with Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| Commissioner Daley, did you want to go back to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| Commissioner Smith, your light's back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| Ms. Witt, as we increase the services, I know it's great convenience for our citizenship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| but are we getting any funds from the state to support these things that they normally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| We are making $4 for every ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| That doesn't sound, for the Real ID, that doesn't sound like a lot, but think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| the lost revenue if we didn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| So, as I just read you off the numbers, that's increasing every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| So yes, we're getting, you know, and we do, we retain a portion of everything we do from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| Whether we retain it or they turn around and send it back, that's part of those excess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| fees that we turn over every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| Back to you, Commissioner Daley, to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| I just want to thank Graham Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| With our talks together, they really went out of their way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| They added driving teller lanes and things like that, so I appreciate them working well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| We have enjoyed working with them, and just like I said, it's a very preliminary circumstance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| but still, they are wonderful to work with, and we are looking forward to a great partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1275)|

| 0:21:48| Is there any other elected officials that I haven't had a chance to recognize here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1313)|

| 0:22:03| Do we need to actually, we have not had a vote on this, we've had extensive discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| so there was an original motion, then we had a substitute motion to send forward with no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1331)|

| 0:22:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| So that is the motion that is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1335)|

| 0:22:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| We'll go ahead and do 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| On page seven, item number 45 is a discussion item to receive information on schoolroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| sterilization for flu and viruses by Inazon Company President, CEO, John P. Shanahan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1353)|
| 0:22:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| Commissioner Buster, I think you brought this discussion item to us and our special guest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| It's a good day today to have Mr. Shanahan here because we're taking our flu shots, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1369)|
| 0:22:55| I got to tour his plant, which is here in Knoxville, which he's starting up here using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1375)|
| 0:23:01| local people and local businesses to help keep his business going for this sterilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1381)|
| 0:23:08| But I was looking at it, and it's less labor intensive than getting down and rubbing each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| desk in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| And it can be, I guess, he'll explain the process to you, but I was just blown away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1395)|
| 0:23:22| with how easy and less labor intensive it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| And so, Mr. Shanahan, if you'll introduce yourself and tell us where you're at, I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| let you do all the talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| Thank you, Commissioners, and it's an honor to be here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| Ionogen is what you read about in the newspapers when you hear about where the new jobs come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| from in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| It's not from the General Motors and the Fords.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| It's from companies like this, and it is because of the investment community and the vibrant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| business community that has funded us and invited us to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| I'm pleased to be in your community, and we are providing jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| We bring our workers in from places like the Sunshine Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| We employ a couple of disabled veterans, one of them who was just recently homeless, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| it's a near and dear part to my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| And it's part of the reason I brought Ionogen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| Very good friend of mine and an advocate, Dr. Gene Overholt, and I have been friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| And Dr. Overholt was seeking better ways to have disinfection for healthcare facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| because of the rising amount of what we call hospital-acquired infections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| And he said, I'd like you to consider bringing that technology here, and I was pleased to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| plant the company here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| I'm even more pleased to say that we work with organizations like Bertle Camp, who helps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| us do our electronics in our businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| We work with the plastics company across the street from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| The community here allows us to have access to the technology that we couldn't find in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| places like Texas and California, but we find it here in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1487)|
| 0:24:53| And for the last 37 years, I have worked in the professional environmental sanitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1493)|
| 0:24:59| industry, specifically making sure our buildings are safe, making sure that our buildings are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| free from disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| And one of the challenges that we've seen in the last 10 years that have exponentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| exploded is the health of our public schools, and it's become a greater challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| Today, we see things like measles coming back, and measles is in this state, and it's moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| through this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| And you don't know what an immunized child may or may not look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| We now see other pathogens like norovirus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| Norovirus was what closed Chipotle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| Norovirus is what almost put Chipotle out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| We see hand, foot, and mouth, which travels through the states very rapidly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| These are illnesses that we have not had to experience in this country for years and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| years, but they're moving, and they're here, and they're taking a stronger hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| Now, since 1982, I've been involved in environmental sanitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| Not a lot has changed in the people and the tools, rather, that the folks get to use to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| take care of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| We are using string mops that were first invented in the 1880s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| We've now gone to microfiber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| Sure, that's true, but we are still employing the technology that says, come to someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| like myself in my late 50s, I'm going to give you a rag and a trigger bottle, and I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| you to wipe down 350 desks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| What happens is we wind up seeing schools closing because the flu germ will live on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| this surface for a long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| In the documentation I've provided with you today, our own World Health Organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| CDC, and Vanderbilt University says the flu that's coming this year to Tennessee will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| be severe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| They look at Australia to see what comes, and Dr. Schaffner from Vanderbilt University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1599)|
| 0:26:45| says it's coming, and so get your shots, because what's coming is coming aggressively, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| here's the other side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| You might get a shot for type A, but H1N3 might come, and what happens is very often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1612)|
| 0:26:59| the flu is misdiagnosed or not found to be norovirus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| Three years ago, the University of North Carolina approved Dr. Leanne Jacobs, and I sat on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| commission determined for the first time that norovirus, when a child throws up, can travel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| 50 feet by air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| We always thought viruses were something you touched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| Now we know they travel by air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| The schools have never had a greater challenge in their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| We've got tools that were created in the late 1960s at the very best of the 1970s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1646)|
| 0:27:32| We go to people who love working in your schools, and by the way, I've been in some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| They're brilliantly clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| Your people work really hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| I've met some of your custodial staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| There are some people there that have made a career out of working in your schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| They love being in those schools, but the newest, latest tool that an industry, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| it's not your school district, it's the cleaning industry, was created to give them microfiber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1670)|
| 0:27:57| rags and a trigger bottle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| You can't wipe down 350 desks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| Fifteen years ago, I created a version of what you think you know as bleach, but is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| known as hypochlorous acid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| It's bleach's sister.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| It's chlorine, but it's neutral pH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| Today we build whole swimming pools out of this solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| In 1974, the US EPA determined that this solution was 80 to 200 times more effective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1695)|
| 0:28:23| more effective than bleach on bacterias, but it's non-toxic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| It's non-poisonous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| It's not harmful, and so what we're building over on Bomb Drive is a device that actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| builds this chlorinated solution that's not harmful to us, so most things that kill germs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1714)|
| 0:28:41| kill you because you're a living organism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| Hypochlorous doesn't because it's in you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| It's generated by your white blood cells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| Our company builds these compact little devices that build these solutions, and then we build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1729)|
| 0:28:55| the delivery mechanism, so I could come into this chamber, put this solution in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| mist while all of us are in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| It would land on the surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| It would have a good kill step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| Now instead of taking somebody my age and asking me to wipe down all of these surfaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| we build both the device that builds it and the delivery system that puts it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| This is modern technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| I always tell people that you go into your public schools, you'll find out that every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| custodian has a smartphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| These are really brilliant people because we know today if you don't have a smartphone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| you can't talk to your grandkids because they don't know how to pick up the thing and call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| We have to text them back or our grandkids can't talk to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| They need technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| They deserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| When we put this technology in Elk Grove schools in Northern California, they were closing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| for hand, foot, mouth, and the flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| In six years, they've never closed a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1783)|

| 0:29:50| They were randomly closing elementaries and middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| They have not closed in six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| Does that mean sick kids don't come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| The kids are still coming in sick, but when they see three or four kids out of Eisenhower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| Elementary going home, they go and they miss that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| It's a proactive approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| It's a fast approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| Last year, Dr. Overholt, at his own cost, went into Chilhowee and Sunnyview, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1807)|
| 0:30:14| did chronicle testing for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| We didn't charge anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| And we used a measurement swab, and we were able to strategically improve by 96 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1819)|
| 0:30:27| by 96 percent, the removal of what we call dirt in those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1827)|
| 0:30:32| Here's the interesting thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| No one ever wiped the surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| By simply spraying this solution without any physical contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| Folks, I've been in the cleaning business since 82.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| If you would have told me you could remove a good portion of dirt without ever touching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| it, I would have told you you were crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| But that's what we're doing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| The technology is moving along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| And so we would like to propose to help the district, and we'll even adopt a school or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| two at our own cost, but we want to help you so that you never close again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| Because the cost, the cost to the city is enormous, but the cost to the community is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1861)|
| 0:31:07| worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| I met a regional manager from Weigel's when I moved here, and the schools were closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| And he said, I've lost my director of 12 stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| She's a single mom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| Her husband passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| She can't come to work because she had a little one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| And the choice was go to work or take care of her child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1880)|
| 0:31:25| She's paid by the hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| When she's not working, she's not making any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| These closings really impact the cost to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| Let's see if we can partner together, bring in a little technology, should lower the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| of what you do, and compared to closing the schools, it should be a tremendous savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| But that's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| We're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| We're so proud to be in your town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| I'm so humbled and honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| And with the help of Dr. Overholt and other business leaders in town, we want to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| improve the health of your schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| I just have a question for our schools and our health department as to what are we currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| doing in this field?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| All right, go ahead, Russ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1931)|
| 0:32:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| What we're doing right now is pretty standard with no argument with what was portrayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1953)|
| 0:32:41| It's the same process we've been using for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| I think our products have changed significantly over time, and the efficacy of the products| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1964)|
| 0:32:51| that we use has improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1971)|
| 0:32:57| What we do at this point when there is a high level of absenteeism at a school, it is hands-on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1977)|
| 0:33:06| and we go in and we disinfect broadly and bring in extra custodial staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1986)|
| 0:33:13| We have four groups that we call dream teams that we move around the county to augment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=1993)|
| 0:33:21| custodial staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| Some of our challenge is to try to hold down the man hours involved in what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2003)|
| 0:33:31| because custodial work gets to be time intensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2011)|
| 0:33:37| We're running right now one custodian for about every 35,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| So that's a lot of space that they have to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| We're also running every day about a 10% vacancy rate for our custodial positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2026)|
| 0:33:55| So it's just a constant churn with custodians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| So we've met with Dr. Overholt and the folks from Ionogen, and we've discussed their products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2038)|
| 0:34:10| We're certainly interested in continuing to have those discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| but we haven't seen anything yet that would be cost effective for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2055)|
| 0:34:23| But like I'm saying, we're still in those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| Dr. Buchanan, as the director of our health department, you work closely with our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2069)|
| 0:34:35| Do you have an opinion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| Is this a technology that you've seen used other places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| I'm not familiar with its use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| It's not my area of expertise to industrial hygiene stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| We work with the schools and advise them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| Hand washing, vaccination, staying home when you're sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| those are really great preventive measures as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| So we really serve as advisory for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| Yeah, Mr. Shanahan, I have a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| Number one, thank you for the detailed work here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| but my question is I don't see a dollar amount anywhere, and if we could have that maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2117)|
| 0:35:23| One of the things that I do see in your documentation is that you're spraying schools three times a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2123)|
| 0:35:30| Is that the minimum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| Is that the max?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| Actually, the schools that have the highest level of success base the activity on somewhat what was just discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2133)|
| 0:35:42| As school illness rises, and it does rise because brothers will take germs home to sisters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| and things like this, and it moves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| If we see we have four kids down at the office going home, we might spray that school four days in a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| But we can go into a classroom and where now he makes a great program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| There's just not enough people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| There's not enough custodians anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| It's not a desired workforce anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| We can go in, and in two minutes, Dr. Overholt in his 80s was able to knock out whole schools in an hour and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2165)|
| 0:36:12| So this is something that the custodial staff could every morning or every night before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2172)|
| 0:36:20| How long does it stay good for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| If I spray at nighttime, when I come in in the morning, what's the time limit that we're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| We always want the germs, the killer to hang around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| We go in and we get an instant kill, and that all happens within 30 seconds to a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| But it's not a residual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| So we're not leaving poisons laying around the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| And that's one of the biggest challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| A lot of the chemistry and chemicals, specifically one known as quaternary disinfectants, have been found to be harmful to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2201)|
| 0:36:48| Several universities abandoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| The Food and Drug Administration just told the restaurant industry to pull it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| So at the end of the school year, if we spray all of our classrooms and they're not contaminated by any human contact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| that would be good whenever we reopened at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| What happens is we respond to the building as its needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| So a middle school might have it less than a high school, but we do it either on a program basis, three days a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2224)|
| 0:37:11| or we'll do it as we see census rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| Charlie, I'm going to get back to you, but I'd like to give Commissioner Carringer a chance to weigh in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2238)|
| 0:37:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| And to Dr. Overhoe for bringing this to public awareness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| As you know, I completely, 100 percent support anything that we can do in terms of making it better for our health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2251)|
| 0:37:39| and particularly our children and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| So from what I'm hearing right now in your particular spray and what is being sprayed in the school systems now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2262)|
| 0:37:52| we don't know what is really in what is being sprayed now in the school system as to is it harming our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2272)|
| 0:38:00| Is there some long-term effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| Because I know with spraying for insects or any of that stuff that goes around in the schools, I mean, all of that has a harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2283)|
| 0:38:11| And that's why, I mean, I love essential oils and what I use in my home as a spray to clean that has no harm to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2291)|
| 0:38:27| So this particular product that you all are talking about is something that I really think as a county we need to get involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2307)|
| 0:38:38| and listen and find out because I'm sure that it could not be any more expensive to use than what we're using right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2318)|
| 0:38:47| And so to be able to go in and have our custodians go into the classrooms and spray this, there's no way to keep the germs and viruses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2327)|
| 0:38:56| And I'm going to tell you people, hand sanitizer does not take care of our common stomach bugs and everything going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2336)|
| 0:39:05| So this does not get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| You cannot wipe children's desks with hand sanitizer and think we've got rid of the flu and spreading it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| The flu is already out very heavily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| One big question was the immunization of the flu shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| You highly recommend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| And I know Dr. Overholt does also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| So along with trying to encourage our parents to make sure that their children are vaccinated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2367)|
| 0:39:33| to not only protect themselves but to protect other people and other children because that's normally what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2373)|
| 0:39:40| We get our children the flu shot and do everything, but it's the other ones who don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2380)|
| 0:39:48| When you're around the public, you need to make sure that you're trying to protect yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| and most importantly protect other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| So how do we as a county, as county commissioners go forward to spread the word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2396)|
| 0:40:04| to encourage getting the flu shot to our children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| And I'm telling you, my newborn grandbabies get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| And the younger ones, you know, they got them in two doses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| So it does not give you the flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| There's all these misconceptions that people have in their mind that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| and by getting the flu shot, and if you do get the flu, nine times out of ten, you're not going to be as sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2424)|
| 0:40:31| And it's very deadly to the younger population and our elderly more so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| And so I would like to see us carry this discussion on and even have, if we need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2437)|
| 0:40:44| Commissioner Busler, have some kind of a little workshop and bring everybody involved that would make these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2444)|
| 0:40:53| I'd like to see this come about in the next few days sooner than later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| because I believe this is really something that needs to be taking top priority for us as we go into this season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2459)|
| 0:41:07| So thank you very much, and I'm going to look forward to carrying this discussion on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| You're facing greater challenges than ever before in public buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| whether it's the office building that supports this building or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| But consider, if you haven't, the schools have one level of risk that they have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| They have people today who, to your point, they don't believe in any immunization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| What does a non-immunized person look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| You have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| And they'll put anything on their form to get their son or daughter into school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| Then we have a mass population coming to our country from other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| They maybe never had immunization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| They're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| We want to certainly help people that we can help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| But then you've got this other thing called the greatest incubator there is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| this big yellow vehicle that transports your children and your grandchildren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| That's an incubator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| You put 78 children inside of that big yellow bus, and they pick up elementary, then middle, then high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2516)|
| 0:42:02| Now you've spread disease from one family to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| You call the people who run the school buses and ask them if they've ever disinfected a bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| How much is this, a gallon, and how far is it spread?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| So it's administered through a power sprayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| Typically about a quart will cover anywhere between 1,000 to 2,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2539)|
| 0:42:27| Because it's atomized, it's put through a power sprayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| So instead of asking somebody to manual distribute it, it's cost per usable gallon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| comparable with a quaternary disinfectant, which is available in the market today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| Back to you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| The one thing that they have out in their plant, when you get to go through and see what they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2566)|
| 0:42:53| and how it's non-toxic, was one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| But the other thing was the many uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| Think about patrol cars, sheriff's deputies that are out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2579)|
| 0:43:05| and they're dealing with all kinds of things that are going on out there during flu seasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2585)|
| 0:43:11| And we don't want those people to really get sick and not be able to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| And even in the courthouse here, wouldn't it be good if we could atomize this desk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2597)|
| 0:43:26| anything else we're touching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| so we don't get sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| If it works, it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| I guess she was asking how could we give an example of what's going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2613)|
| 0:43:39| Would it be better for some of the commissioners to come and visit you at your plant, like I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2619)|
| 0:43:44| and show what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2624)|
| 0:43:45| And also the other thing here, too, is it's hooked on to CDC to where some of the technology he's got, it's all Wi-Fi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2625)|
| 0:43:54| It'll tell you if it's being used or if it's not being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| It'll let you know if there's flu in the area, if there was things that were coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| And so it's got a lot of technology to it, too, that he didn't even touch on that he could talk to you at the plant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2641)|
| 0:44:10| that makes sure that it is being used and being used properly and tell you how it stays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2650)|
| 0:44:16| You don't have to shake it up every time that you want to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| It's already to its full strength no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| If you let it sit for 24 or 48 hours, you pick it up and you don't need to shake it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| It's ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| So, anyway, maybe we could set up a time for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2669)|
| 0:44:35| We're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| We're welcome to have you all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| We're on 6321 Baum Drive, the old Bertelkamp Automation, the original Bertelkamp Automation building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2677)|
| 0:44:43| You all know him better than you know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| I've come to learn how famous he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| And we're welcome at any schedule to come on over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| One, we'd like to show you where this technology for disinfection is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| But, two, I'd love for you to meet the great workers that we find in this town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| just some of the greatest people, and it makes building a corporation here much easier, much easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2701)|
| 0:45:08| So, please, Charles has my information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| Welcome at any schedule that you have here in our part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| Please do come by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| Let us show you what the future of safety and sanitation looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| And each one of your packages you've got, you've got his phone number, his name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| and you need to go by and see how this stuff works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| I was just blown away with it, with how easy it is to administer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| So, I do appreciate you coming to let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| Dr. Overholt, I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| You know, he was, after talking to them a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| they probably want to stay and watch the rest of this commission, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| It's good to have you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| Thank you all for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| Madam Clerk, what's our next item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| That should take us back to the top of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| Can I ask Holly if she's ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| We do have some other special guests here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| I see our extension agent and quite a few 4-H participants in our audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2766)|
| 0:46:13| One of the other discussion items that we had with many special, special guests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| was regarding the impact of the 4-H program on our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| and I see everyone here in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| So, Holly, if you could please approach the podium, state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| And, Carson, if you could introduce this item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| Sure will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| I had the pleasure, along with Commissioner Busler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| going to the Ag Committee meeting at the TVA fair, and we learned a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2795)|
| 0:46:41| We've got some brilliant 4-H students here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| And, Holly, was it like over 4,000, 5,000 farms that we still have in Knox County, I believe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2804)|
| 0:46:52| That number was way up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| That would be a Neil Denton question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| Well, Neil couldn't make it tonight, so it's up to you two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| But thank you, 4-H, for being here and being introduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| And they've won not only Knox County awards, they've won a lot of state awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| And, for the record, this is Item 46 on the commission agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| And if both of you all, for our record, if you could state your name and address, for the record, for the clerk's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| we'd appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2838)|
| 0:47:19| My name is Sharon Davis, and I'm one of the 4-H agents here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2839)|
| 0:47:23| And thank you for having us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2843)|
| 0:47:24| My name is Holly McMahan, and I'm also one of the 4-H extension agents for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2844)|
| 0:47:32| And it looks like we're here to talk about the Tennessee Valley Fair 4-H exhibits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| and how it impacts 4-H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| And one of the big things that we do in 4-H is participate in the Tennessee Valley Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2858)|
| 0:47:45| And it's not just going to the fair and eating cotton candy and riding rides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| Those are all the perks, and that's how we get the kids there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| But they're actually doing and learning lots of things while they're at the Tennessee Valley Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| We have things like judging teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| So, in judging teams, we teach them how to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| It could be a decision in the consumer decision-making teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| where they're learning about how to select clothing items based on the best price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| It could be on a forestry judging team where they're learning how to identify 50 different trees by their leaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2889)|
| 0:48:16| It could be so many things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| But what we do is teach them how to look at the criteria and the information they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| and how to make the decisions based on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| So, the Tennessee Valley Fair hosts all of the Eastern Region 4-H judging team activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| and we estimate that there's probably about close to 400 people that go to the fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2910)|
| 0:48:36| on the second Saturday of every month to participate in those teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| So, that's just one tiny aspect of how 4-H is impacted by the Tennessee Valley Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| From there, those teams will compete in the state contest, which was actually this past Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| So, if we didn't have the venue at the fair supporting that and providing money for the awards for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| then we wouldn't be able to participate in the state contest without being prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2934)|
| 0:48:59| And I'm really grateful to say that Knox County 4-H judging teams have been highly successful throughout the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2939)|
| 0:49:05| We have several members here who are past judging team winners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| and we also won the state forestry judging team contest this past Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| So, we're going to West Virginia to represent all of Tennessee at West Virginia next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| And I'm going to let Holly talk about consumer decision making, and she has some of her team members here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| Like Sharon was saying, consumer decision making, what they are really doing in that contest is looking at products,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2965)|
| 0:49:32| selecting criteria that's given for them about a person who is purchasing that product, and making a decision on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2972)|
| 0:49:40| So, it really does teach a valuable skill, and it also teaches a good amount of communication as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2980)|
| 0:49:45| because not only do they have to make that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| they also have to give oral reasons and defend why they placed the categories the way they did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2988)|
| 0:49:55| as well as do a group think process, where together as a team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| they are working through a scenario and coming up with the best solution for that scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3000)|
| 0:50:07| And this year, well, in the past, or this past year, we had a team actually go to Denver and compete in the national contest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3007)|
| 0:50:17| and they placed fifth at that competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| And then this year, we had a team actually qualify to go to the state contest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| and out of 11 teams, they ended up placing third on the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| So, we're extremely proud of them and excited for them, because it was their very first year doing consumer decision making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3029)|
| 0:50:36| And several of them are back here right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| If you two or you three would stand up and participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| One of the other judging teams that we have there is the poultry judging team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3043)|
| 0:50:53| So, what do you do in poultry judging?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| Well, if you are a consumer and you go to the grocery store and you buy grade A eggs, what is a grade A egg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3055)|
| 0:51:01| and how do you know you're getting a safe product?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| We teach that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3064)|
| 0:51:05| We teach cuts of poultry and retail cuts of poultry and how to judge dress market birds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| how to judge live birds for egg laying capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| So, last year, the team from Knox County went to the national contest in Louisville, Kentucky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3074)|
| 0:51:20| and they actually placed, I think, 15th out of 32 teams in the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3080)|
| 0:51:26| But the big take-home message from that was there was a lot of industry leaders there from Tyson and Purdue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3086)|
| 0:51:32| and all of them were courted, so to speak, by some of these industries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3092)|
| 0:51:38| and some of these representatives from these companies saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| if you ever want a job in the poultry industry, please come and see us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| And so, if you were on the poultry judging team, and we have one of our coach here, let's have them stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| If you'll please stand and give them a round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3109)|
| 0:51:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| So, this year, like I said, we're going to West Virginia in the forestry contest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| Very excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3121)|
| 0:52:02| We've been looking to go to that contest for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3122)|
| 0:52:05| and this is our first year to go since I've been the agent and I started in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| We took some teams way back when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| Also, what goes on at the Tennessee Valley Fair is livestock shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| So, people say, what do we do with a livestock show?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| What do we do at that, and what is the child actually learning by showing an animal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| Well, before you actually ever get to the fair to show the animal, you have to train the animal to be shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3142)|
| 0:52:29| So, you don't want cows that are running around and kicking and bucking and knocking over fences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3149)|
| 0:52:34| You don't want chickens that have never been handled or have mites or some kind of disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3154)|
| 0:52:40| So, they have to look for healthy animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| They have to take care of their animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| So, we're teaching responsibility with these livestock shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| We have poultry, rabbit, beef, and sheep that are very well represented at the Tennessee Valley Fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| and we actually host the poultry judging contest at the Tennessee Valley Fair where all the eastern region comes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3172)|
| 0:52:57| and Knox County puts on that contest for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| So, if you have showed animals at the Tennessee Valley Fair, would you please stand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3180)|
| 0:53:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3185)|
| 0:53:11| One of the other benefits of showing livestock at the Tennessee Valley Fair is scholarships that these kids earn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3191)|
| 0:53:17| So, there are $500 scholarships, $1,000 scholarships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| So, you can actually make a pretty good bit of money if you're showing some livestock at the fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3201)|
| 0:53:29| and you do a good job at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| So, you can put that back away for college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| One of the other things that we do at the Tennessee Valley Fair is we have an exhibit area in the Jacobs Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3213)|
| 0:53:39| And so, if you've ever wandered through the Jacobs Building, you'll see lots of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| But if you go upstairs, you'll see photography and crafts and all kinds of things that the 4-H'ers have put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3222)|
| 0:53:49| And these 4-H'ers are anywhere from fourth grade to twelfth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| And so, what are we teaching with the craft and the photography exhibits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| Well, basically, we're teaching, number one, how to follow instructions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| because you have to put the right item in the right category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| And every once in a while, we have to do some switching around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| And number two, you are learning communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| So, if they're doing a drawing or a photography exhibit, what are they trying to communicate to the judges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3248)|
| 0:54:13| And this year, I'm proud to say that Knox County had the most exhibits out of any county in the eastern region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3253)|
| 0:54:19| And so, we actually won the exhibitory contest for the Tennessee Valley Fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| with the most exhibits out of all the counties at the Tennessee Valley Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| So, we're very proud of all the things that we've done at Tennessee Valley Fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| and the opportunities it's provided for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| The last thing is Congress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| Do you want to talk about Congress?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| So, Congress, Tennessee 4-H Congress is an event held between Murfreesboro and Nashville in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3277)|
| 0:54:46| And we have, I would say, probably 500 plus 4-H'ers from all across the state come in to this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3286)|
| 0:54:53| Knox County, I believe we had eight this past year that participated in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| And there is two ways that we have participation in Tennessee 4-H Congress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| One is that 4-H'ers can go as delegates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| And in that process, they actually have a mock legislative process that they go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| So, they're actually sitting in the same seats as the senators and delegates are sitting in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3313)|
| 0:55:18| Senators and representatives are sitting in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| And they actually do debate mock bills and go through the voting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| as well as they hold elections for 4-H governor, 4-H state speaker of the Senate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3325)|
| 0:55:32| and 4-H speaker of the House of Representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| So, they do those things while they are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| The other thing that can be done at, there's actually two more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3339)|
| 0:55:43| The other, one other thing that can be done during Tennessee 4-H Congress is we have 4-H'ers who compete in citizenship and leadership projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3343)|
| 0:55:54| And these are outstanding 4-H'ers who have worked for several years building up a portfolio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3354)|
| 0:56:02| which is a record-keeping tool that we have in 4-H, where they have shown pretty success in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3362)|
| 0:56:12| And they go and they actually interview for college scholarships at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| And we had several compete in that, in both the citizenship and leadership projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| And then we also had someone compete, or two people from our county compete in the state public speaking contest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3382)|
| 0:56:30| And for that, it is pretty competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| This is one of the higher levels of competition to make it to the state contest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3393)|
| 0:56:38| They have to make it through their local club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| Then they have to make it through the county contest, the region contest, and then eventually to get to the state contest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3401)|
| 0:56:47| And Jerome Andrews is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| And he was one of the state finalists that went on to compete in public speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3410)|
| 0:56:57| And he actually is now the alternate to go to the national contest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3421)|
| 0:57:08| If we can take just one more minute of your time, and thank you for letting us come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| We did invite some 4-H'ers that we're particularly proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| And in your electronic packet, we sent our report that we give out every year to show what we've done in 4-H| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| and how many kids we have and the demographics and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| And we're proud to say that we have 1,502 kids enrolled in organized regular meeting clubs here in 4-H in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3444)|
| 0:57:32| And we don't do that just because me and Holly are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| We do that because we also have 100 volunteers in 4-H, 106 to be exact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3454)|
| 0:57:40| So these people go out into the community and they meet at a regular basis and do some kind of project group meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3460)|
| 0:57:47| or they're doing a school club meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| And so that's how we are able to reach this many kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3469)|
| 0:57:52| And then there are other things like farm days and we go to the Mayor's Back to School Mania.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3472)|
| 0:57:58| We get to see a lot more kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3478)|

| 0:59:33| because public speaking is very hard if you haven't done it, you know, as a competitor before or even just in this kind of venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3573)|

| 1:04:02| This is a pretty neat deal here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| And I just thought it would be interesting to pull it just to get a brief, if you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| go over the timeline and just a few more of the details on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| It's clearly the right move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| And I want to commend all of y'all for, this I'm sure has taken a lot of horse trading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| over the last year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3858)|
| 1:04:19| What, you know, as we've got proposed construction of a new Lonsdale Elementary School, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3859)|
| 1:04:24| want to keep it in Lonsdale, in the center of Lonsdale, and the most viable location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3864)|
| 1:04:31| for us is on four acres of property that's currently Lonsdale Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3871)|
| 1:04:36| And we've been in discussion with the City and the City Mayor's Office and the County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3876)|
| 1:04:41| Mayor's Office for the last several weeks to put this agreement together and bring it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3881)|
| 1:04:47| to the Board of Education, the Commission, and the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| The Board of Ed approved it last week, and it will be on City Council's agenda based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3891)|
| 1:04:58| on the action of this body in November for them to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3898)|
| 1:05:04| The timeline on it is we'll pick up the Lonsdale Park property as quickly as the agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3904)|
| 1:05:13| is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| We won't lose the Sammy Hill property to the City until the construction of the new school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3915)|
| 1:05:20| is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| And at that point, the City will pick up ownership to it, and my understanding is their intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3922)|
| 1:05:29| is to demolish a portion of the building, the classroom wings, to retain the cafeteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3929)|
| 1:05:38| the kitchen, the gymnasium, the administrative spaces of the building, and use those for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3938)|
| 1:05:44| recreational purposes and community use, and basically rebuild the Lonsdale Park on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3944)|
| 1:05:51| piece of property that is currently Sammy Hill School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| And all of that will take place over the next about three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3955)|
| 1:06:01| The process we're in right now, once this is complete, the County Mayor's Office has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3961)|
| 1:06:08| expressed an interest in managing the construction of the Lonsdale Elementary School, and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3968)|
| 1:06:14| currently trying to put together a memorandum of agreement for that project as well that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3974)|
| 1:06:20| would be between the Board and Mayor's Office and this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| So once that's in place, I think you'd see a lot more movement with contracting with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3983)|
| 1:06:30| architects and general contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3993)|
| 1:06:34| Sounds like a win-win-win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| And, you know, my comment, even when three years ago Emerald and the exchange of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=3998)|
| 1:06:44| property occurred with the city, and here's where I disagree with the opportunity to tear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4004)|
| 1:06:50| down those wings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| This community is in desperate need of a library, and the opportunity to extend from the Murphy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4012)|
| 1:06:58| Library, that one room in the CAC building, which is what I expressed more than a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4018)|
| 1:07:02| ago to the County Mayor, to look at how we can better serve the needs of the people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4022)|
| 1:07:09| live in that community in terms of having a library, and to demolish wings where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4029)|
| 1:07:15| could really begin to build and bridge better community services there needs a deeper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4035)|
| 1:07:22| conversation, as well as to subtract parks out of an area with a high degree of health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4042)|
| 1:07:29| disparity, because this is the same concern I expressed three years ago, a year ago, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4049)|
| 1:07:34| today, that we could better utilize a greater conversation with that community to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4054)|
| 1:07:40| we look at some of those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4067)|
| 1:07:48| The motion on the floor is to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4068)|
| 1:07:52| Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4074)|
| 1:07:55| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4075)|

| 1:08:01| Passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4081)|
| 1:08:02| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4082)|
| 1:08:03| Before we move on past schools, while the schools are here, could I just make one quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4083)|
| 1:08:07| announcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4089)|
| 1:08:10| About a school-related event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| I want to thank the Knox County School team, and you all received an invitation to an event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| called Politicode on November 5th at 9 a.m. at Farragut High School, and I would strongly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4095)|
| 1:08:21| encourage you all to look at that and sign up and participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| It's a great partnership between the Great Schools Partnership, Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| and the Technology Alliance to introduce coding and computer sciences, and essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4108)|
| 1:08:34| it is an event where we're pairing Knox County students with elected officials to learn coding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4114)|
| 1:08:42| where they will actually teach us coding, and you can imagine a kindergarten or first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| grader all the way through middle school sitting down in a fun and enjoyable way and engaging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4127)|
| 1:08:53| and I want to thank the schools for their participation in it, and I'd hope everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| would sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4136)|
| 1:08:57| It's a quick and easy event, about an hour and a half on a Tuesday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| It is actually Election Day, and so the school won't be in session, and the kids will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| able to participate, so please take a look for that, and thank you again to the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4145)|
| 1:09:09| for helping facilitate both the space and the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4149)|
| 1:09:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4155)|
| 1:09:16| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| Maybe they can teach me how to program my VCR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| They can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| They can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| It's too hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| You're way beyond it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4163)|
| 1:09:24| Too big a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| It'll be a great event, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4166)|
| 1:09:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4167)|
| 1:09:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4169)|
| 1:09:30| Yeah, I'm playing on being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4170)|
| 1:09:31| So, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| On page four, item number 21 is a resolution approving a supplement to CSXT four-party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| railroad agreement between the Tennessee Department of Transportation, CSXT, the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4177)|
| 1:09:43| and Knox County for the replacement, construction, and or widening and maintenance repairs thereof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4183)|
| 1:09:48| of a bridge structure and approaches to carry Topside Road over the tracks of the CSXT railroad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4188)|
| 1:09:55| which agreement provides for a modification to the county-maintained portion of Topside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| Road and has no cost to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| Resolution 404.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4205)|
| 1:10:06| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| I'd like to get a motion for approval on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4209)|
| 1:10:10| A motion from Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4210)|
| 1:10:11| Is there a second from Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4211)|
| 1:10:14| Discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| Yeah, Jim, I pulled this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| I just had a quick question on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| I remember when we originally approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| And was this one of those where the cost came in a little high?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| Or what's the quick update on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| The state, in preparation of the plans, had to make a revision to the bridge structure itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4226)|
| 1:10:33| And in doing so, when they sent it back to CSX, CSX obviously had some modifications to their estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4233)|
| 1:10:39| So TDOT will pay for the entirety of this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| We will just maintain the portion of Topside Road that's in the county, modified by the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4243)|
| 1:10:48| and the realignment of Topside as part of Alcohol Highways Widening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4248)|
| 1:10:52| And a follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4252)|
| 1:10:53| Are they using some of the gas tax monies on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| I know that first wave of the gas tax monies was going primarily towards bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4256)|
| 1:11:00| And I thought this might be one of those projects from when we approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| There are several phases of Alcohol Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| We're part of the Improve Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| So, yes, sir, that is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4268)|
| 1:11:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4271)|
| 1:11:12| I just want to let everyone know that the Maloney Road to Blount County line is in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4272)|
| 1:11:17| It's starting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| And so once that intersection is done and the bridge access and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4279)|
| 1:11:24| it's going to make everything a whole lot smoother at that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| Is that correct, Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4289)|
| 1:11:30| All those people out on the island won't have to make that unprotected left turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| They'll have a bridge elevated structure to get them across and onto the frontage roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4293)|
| 1:11:38| and onto north and southbound alcohol highways without having to turn left across that heavy volume of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4298)|
| 1:11:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4305)|
| 1:11:46| Thank you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4306)|
| 1:11:47| I appreciate the clarification, but stay there because you're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| We have a proper motion before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4314)|
| 1:11:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4315)|
| 1:11:56| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4316)|
| 1:11:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4317)|
| 1:11:58| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4320)|
| 1:12:01| Item number 25 is a resolution approving a term contract with Applied Pavement Technology Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| for Pavement Management Systems Engineering in the amount of $279,354 for an initial data collection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4326)|
| 1:12:14| and implementation as well as agreed upon unit rates for ongoing data collection needed to update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4334)|
| 1:12:20| and maintain pavement management systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| This is resolution 408.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| Do we have a motion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4347)|
| 1:12:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| We have a motion for approval from Commissioner Daley with a second from Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| Jim, if you could provide a little more details on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| I know when I pulled it, we're investing a lot in technology as it relates to roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| I know we're trying to be more savvy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| If you could provide a little additional insight on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| This is actually one of the most exciting things I think we've undertaken in my tenure at the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4367)|
| 1:12:52| Essentially, Applied Pavement Technologies has a van that's much like a Google van.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| Is this the X-ray machine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| It is the X-ray machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| It has laser scanners on it and high-resolution imagery that will take photos of our roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4382)|
| 1:13:10| frontward, sideward, downward, and backward facing every 20 feet across all 2,000 miles of our roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4390)|
| 1:13:17| And we'll incorporate that into the software piece that's actually another item here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4397)|
| 1:13:23| I guess that would be the previous item, resolution 407,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| and actually give us treatment strategies to be more proactive in our maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4407)|
| 1:13:32| Oftentimes we only can evaluate, due to staff, about 10% of our roadway network a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4412)|
| 1:13:38| so we only know ultimately what's the worst of the worst, which is important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| but we also need to know ones that are going to be two or three years from that worst,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4423)|
| 1:13:49| and we can possibly go in and put a seal code or something down that will extend the life of those roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4429)|
| 1:13:54| for another five or six years rather than it going, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4434)|
| 1:13:58| failing much quicker within a year's time and requiring a more expensive fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4438)|
| 1:14:03| So, although this is a significant amount, it will allow us to better prioritize our roadway treatments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4443)|
| 1:14:10| and, you know, just be more cost effective to the taxpayers of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4450)|
| 1:14:15| and maintain our roads in a better fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4455)|
| 1:14:17| All right. Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| Jim, I'm pretty sure it is, but will this process also measure the widths of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4459)|
| 1:14:25| gives you that actual width in the narrow roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| It will. It will give widths and lengths, and we'll be able to much easily calculate, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4468)|
| 1:14:34| what these treatments, whether it's paving or seal coding or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| we'll be able to have all that information at our hands a lot more quickly and readily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| Okay. Any other questions? Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| Mr. Snowden, once you get the system implemented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| what's the timeline it would take to get it up and running and scan those 2,000 centerline miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4490)|
| 1:14:56| and then ultimately process the data to determine your highest and best need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4496)|
| 1:15:02| The consultant that we're working with, both the data collection and the software vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4502)|
| 1:15:08| are telling us that between six and nine months it will be fully operational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4508)|
| 1:15:12| So, by the time the budget is prepared next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| we should have a very better understanding of the health of our roadway network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4515)|
| 1:15:20| So, that includes the time to scan all 2,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| It does. They can actually do the scanning in what they're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| probably approximately about 30 working days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4526)|
| 1:15:28| So, the van will run at highway speeds, so it will be able to make a lot of progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| So, during the next budget cycle, you'll be able to come back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| we paved 50 last year, but we're seeing we really need to pay 70 or, you know, 40 or whatever the case may be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4535)|
| 1:15:42| Correct. We can look and set target PCIs, which are pavement condition indexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4542)|
| 1:15:48| and actually determine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| So, we want to maintain all our roads at a 70 PCI, which is essentially it's like a school grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4550)|
| 1:15:56| you know, zero to 100, 100 being best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| We can say this is what it would take for us to invest in our network to get to a 70 or to a 65 or a 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4558)|
| 1:16:05| So, it will give us a lot more knowledge on what the health of our system is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4565)|
| 1:16:09| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| Jim, just editorializing here, I think it's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4571)|
| 1:16:14| I think it's working smarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| And I know the mayor and you have made a priority to really think smartly about how we spend money on the roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4576)|
| 1:16:23| and I'm just glad to see this investment, which my hope is that it will deliver as expected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4583)|
| 1:16:28| where we're smarter down the road in terms of how we allocate those roading resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| So, good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| I'm glad to finally see this on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| Thank you for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4596)|
| 1:16:39| Okay, we do have that motion before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4604)|
| 1:16:45| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| Item number 26 is a resolution approving a contract with Innovative Emergency Management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4609)|
| 1:16:55| in the amount not to exceed $188,472 to provide Homeland Security consultant services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4615)|
| 1:17:02| in support of the Complex Coordinated Terrorist Attack Grant Program, resolution 501.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4622)|
| 1:17:09| Okay, could I have a motion for approval, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4633)|
| 1:17:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4634)|
| 1:17:15| A motion came from Commissioner Jay, and the second, I believe, was from Commissioner Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4635)|
| 1:17:19| Jennifer, if you could please, you know, I don't think we need the deep details on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4639)|
| 1:17:24| I spoke with Ben today, as well, just to kind of get the big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4644)|
| 1:17:28| But I understand that this is kind of some work has already been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| and this is going to help us moving forward on this important priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4655)|
| 1:17:36| Our original contractor had some help issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4658)|
| 1:17:39| If you could state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| Jenny Holden, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| Our original contractor had some health issues and was not able to finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4663)|
| 1:17:48| This is actually the continuation of that with some additional work that was not included in that first contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4668)|
| 1:17:55| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4675)|
| 1:17:56| And if you don't mind, just for the benefit of my fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| you've got a pretty unique job here with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| If you could kind of explain what your role is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| So with this grant, this is a competitive grant through the Federal Department of Homeland Security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4682)|
| 1:18:08| And Knox County, we administer the grant, but it actually benefits Tennessee Homeland Security District 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4688)|
| 1:18:14| which is Knox County and the 15 surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| So this grant in particular is about $536,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| We received it two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| We've got a little less than two years left on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| We've completed our gap analysis where we looked at every county to see what was needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4706)|
| 1:18:30| We've got a great list going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| We're doing training and planning and exercises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| Hopefully by the time all is said and done, we'll have about 1,500 people trained, 16 plans updated, new plans created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4716)|
| 1:18:47| This contract that we have tonight, we've got 25 exercises that we'll be working on in 2020 and 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4727)|
| 1:18:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4734)|
| 1:18:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4737)|
| 1:18:58| Yes, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4738)|
| 1:18:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4739)|
| 1:19:00| Where's our largest gaps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4740)|
| 1:19:01| Honestly, right now what we're looking at is rescue task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| Rescue task force training is basically that next piece in active shooter, which is getting medical assistance to the wounded faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4745)|
| 1:19:12| And so what we're doing right now is we've actually, with these funds, we've developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| or are developing a curriculum that we can train our first responders on how to get in faster and stop bleeding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4757)|
| 1:19:26| because that's really the way to save the most lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4766)|
| 1:19:30| So we're putting a lot of money there, but I think it's going to be a huge benefit to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4770)|
| 1:19:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4778)|
| 1:19:39| Any additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4780)|
| 1:19:41| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4781)|
| 1:19:42| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4783)|
| 1:19:44| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4784)|
| 1:19:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4785)|
| 1:19:46| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4786)|
| 1:19:47| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| This is item, on page six, item number 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4792)|
| 1:19:57| It is a resolution to direct the attorney hired by the mayor to represent Knox County in the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4797)|
| 1:20:06| Also, to clarify for the commissioners, as I noted on the form, item 34 was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4806)|
| 1:20:14| So, as chair, I've withdrawn it from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4814)|
| 1:20:20| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4820)|
| 1:20:21| I'm sorry, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| Yeah, go ahead and begin on item 35, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| to direct the attorney hired by the mayor to represent Knox County in the lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| styled Chris Hedders, et al., versus Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| Knox County Chancellor's Court, docket number 198839-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| to continue with all expediency to proceed with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4842)|
| 1:20:47| to have the sole legal issue decided by the chancellor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4847)|
| 1:20:52| and not expend taxpayer money to attempt to dismiss the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4852)|
| 1:20:58| prior to the court ruling on this important public issue, resolution 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4858)|
| 1:21:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| Commissioner Baylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4865)|
| 1:21:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| As the sponsor on this resolution, first of all, I wanted to say I appreciate this being pulled off of consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4867)|
| 1:21:15| because I don't really think that it should be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| And just in that line of thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4877)|
| 1:21:21| I'd like to make a motion that we send this forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4881)|
| 1:21:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4888)|
| 1:21:29| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4889)|
| 1:21:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| Charlie, I think I heard you first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4894)|
| 1:21:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| So the motion on the floor came from Commissioner Baylor with a second by Commissioner Bussler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4896)|
| 1:21:40| and the motion is to send forward with no recommendation to next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4900)|
| 1:21:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4905)|
| 1:21:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4906)|
| 1:21:47| Before we have the vote, is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4909)|
| 1:21:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4910)|
| 1:21:51| Mr. Chairman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4911)|
| 1:21:52| As just a point of procedure in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| I think it would be better for Commissioner Bussler to recuse himself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4915)|
| 1:21:59| and not participate in any motioning, seconds, or discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| given that his family members are party to this lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4923)|
| 1:22:07| and I think it's a really direct conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| So I would ask him to withdraw his second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4932)|
| 1:22:13| That is the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4933)|
| 1:22:14| Commissioner Skinmaker did make an additional second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| so I can recognize Commissioner's second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| It came at about the same time as Commissioner Bussler's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4938)|
| 1:22:22| So, Commissioner Bussler, is that understandable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4945)|
| 1:22:26| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4946)|
| 1:22:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4947)|
| 1:22:28| But she's suing me also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| My daughter is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| So I'm going to have to look at the will and probably rewrite it since you're suing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4956)|
| 1:22:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4957)|
| 1:22:38| So the motion on the floor is to send forward no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| The motion has been made by Commissioner Buehler and seconded by Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4965)|
| 1:22:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| All in favor of sending forward with no recommendation, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4976)|
| 1:23:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4980)|
| 1:23:01| All opposed to sending this forward with no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4981)|
| 1:23:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4987)|
| 1:23:08| Let's do a roll call vote that wasn't clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| Can we start with Commissioner Skinmaker for roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| Well, the motion on the floor is to send forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=4996)|
| 1:23:21| So if that fails, then would this die?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5001)|
| 1:23:24| I want to look to the law director for clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5004)|
| 1:23:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5010)|
| 1:23:31| Well, then, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5011)|
| 1:23:32| So let's, we're going to need to send it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5014)|
| 1:23:35| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5015)|
| 1:23:36| Clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5016)|
| 1:23:37| Clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5017)|
| 1:23:38| If it fails the motion without recommendation, it doesn't kill the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5018)|
| 1:23:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5027)|
| 1:23:48| You can still send it forward with a recommendation of some type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5028)|
| 1:23:53| And then if you vote to kill that, then it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5033)|
| 1:23:57| But the final vote would be next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| Next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5039)|
| 1:24:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5040)|
| 1:24:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5041)|
| 1:24:02| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5042)|
| 1:24:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5043)|
| 1:24:04| I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5044)|
| 1:24:05| If you take a vote and it doesn't pass, you don't move it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5045)|
| 1:24:11| Point of clarification from the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| I don't believe that in a work session we can kill any resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| I'm sure you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5057)|
| 1:24:26| Well, I mean, with no recommendation, I mean, I'd look to the law director on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5066)|
| 1:24:32| I mean, is there, does this work session function as a committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5072)|
| 1:24:38| It only, so you have to vote on it final going forward either with or without recommendation or with or without consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5078)|
| 1:24:46| So if you vote to we don't want to send it without recommendation, then you have to send it with some form of recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5086)|
| 1:24:52| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5092)|
| 1:24:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5093)|
| 1:24:54| Which might be to vote down or vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| This is not the meeting that you kill resolutions in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5096)|
| 1:24:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5099)|
| 1:25:00| Next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5100)|
| 1:25:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5101)|
| 1:25:02| We'll go ahead and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5102)|
| 1:25:03| Next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5104)|
| 1:25:05| Let's just do a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5105)|
| 1:25:06| I've got a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5106)|
| 1:25:07| If it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5107)|
| 1:25:08| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5108)|
| 1:25:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5109)|
| 1:25:10| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5110)|
| 1:25:11| Just thinking back meetings and months ago, I'm almost 110% sure that my recommendation for a mobility study in South Knox County was killed in workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5111)|
| 1:25:21| I think it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5121)|
| 1:25:22| I believe it was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| If I'm just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5126)|
| 1:25:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5127)|
| 1:25:28| This is the way I remembered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| I had it that meeting and the votes weren't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5130)|
| 1:25:35| The thing that I postponed was another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5135)|
| 1:25:39| If we can look back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| I mean, I was just just saying in the previous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| Well, I think for the purpose of getting through this meeting and we've got a motion in a second before us to send this forward with no recommendation that came properly from Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5144)|
| 1:25:57| So the vote, just because, frankly, we did a voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| I could not hear exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5161)|
| 1:26:02| It was just not clear enough because there are some votes for some votes against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5162)|
| 1:26:06| And when it's not perfectly clear, it just makes sense to have a roll call vote so we can move forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5166)|
| 1:26:14| So that's that's kind of where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| So we'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5177)|
| 1:26:18| We'll do a vote on this and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5178)|
| 1:26:22| So unless we want to have a discussion on the merits of the motion that's been made before us, you know, that would be this would be an appropriate time if we wanted to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5182)|
| 1:26:34| Or, you know, per Commissioner Beeler, if we'd like to go ahead and move this discussion to next week's meeting, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5194)|
| 1:26:39| We can discuss it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5199)|
| 1:26:40| It's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5200)|
| 1:26:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5201)|
| 1:26:42| There are no lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| Nobody wants to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5204)|
| 1:26:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| Well, let's go ahead and have the I'm not seeing any lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| So let's go ahead and have the vote to go ahead and just move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5208)|
| 1:26:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5213)|
| 1:26:54| And I don't know where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5214)|
| 1:26:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| Start with Schoenmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5216)|
| 1:26:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5217)|

| 1:27:49| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5270)|
| 1:27:51| 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5271)|
| 1:27:52| We'll hear it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5272)|
| 1:27:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5273)|
| 1:27:54| 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5274)|
| 1:27:55| Okay, so it's 5-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5275)|
| 1:27:56| Does anyone wish to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| I know Commissioner Anders is not present, so no one wishes to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5277)|
| 1:28:14| So if we have a tie, it fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5294)|
| 1:28:18| So to deal with this, Mr. Law Director, what's the best bend of the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5298)|
| 1:28:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5305)|
| 1:28:26| It fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5306)|
| 1:28:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5307)|
| 1:28:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5308)|
| 1:28:29| Ms. Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5309)|
| 1:28:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5310)|
| 1:28:31| I have looked at this, and I'll ask our Law Director, is this resolution anything that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5311)|
| 1:28:46| legally that we can push on to ask Chancellor Weaver to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5326)|
| 1:28:55| I'm not for sure this resolution gives us the legal authority to be able to vote and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5335)|
| 1:29:04| pass to be able to ask Chancellor Weaver that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5344)|
| 1:29:13| The attorney who is John Valant, who is present here tonight, because we all voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5353)|
| 1:29:22| We voted to allow our Knox County Mayor to hire an outside attorney for this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5362)|
| 1:29:31| or issue that we have before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| So still, I don't think this is something that he can do with the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5375)|
| 1:29:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5386)|
| 1:29:47| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| I'm going to go ahead and go back to Commissioner Wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5389)|
| 1:29:54| Are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5394)|
| 1:29:55| Just to clarify, and I think you clarified it yourself, I was just saying that the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5395)|
| 1:30:01| is not to direct the court in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5401)|
| 1:30:02| I would totally agree this body can't direct a court to do anything, to rule on anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5402)|
| 1:30:07| or to rule in any certain way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| The question is whether you think it's right or appropriate for this body to direct the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5409)|
| 1:30:13| attorney that's representing the county, and that should determine your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5413)|
| 1:30:18| Well, our attorney is our law director, Bud Armstrong, that represents the county, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5418)|
| 1:30:25| we're suing ourself, so ...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5427)|
| 1:30:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| No, we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5429)|
| 1:30:30| No, we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5430)|
| 1:30:31| Not this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5431)|
| 1:30:32| Well, not this time, yes, but how this all came about, and then Mayor Jacobs wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5432)|
| 1:30:38| dismiss it in the past, and now he's being sued again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5438)|
| 1:30:43| We allowed him to have outside in the first law suit, and so are we saying that he shouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5443)|
| 1:30:53| be able to do that this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| Point of clarification, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| Are we in discussion about an item that ...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| What I'd like ... You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| If the commissioners want to discuss, the item has failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| It did not pass, so ... However, I am looking at the time, and this is an important item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5466)|
| 1:31:13| if some of the commissioners want to discuss this as a point of order or a clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5473)|
| 1:31:17| I'll enable that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| It's an important enough item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5479)|
| 1:31:20| I mean, I can weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5480)|
| 1:31:21| My personal take is we've hired an attorney, just let him do his job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| I'm not one to try and direct an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| I mean, that's about where I am on it, and that's about all I've got to say on it, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| that's why I voted against the resolution, but if we have commissioners that want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5491)|
| 1:31:37| weigh in on this, also knowing that I do want to, in fairness to the public, try to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5497)|
| 1:31:42| to the 7 o'clock meeting with most of our agenda covered, just want to be fair to everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| on this, but we did make up for some time, and we spent a lot of time learning some cool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5507)|
| 1:31:53| stuff at the first part of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| We've been productive, and I will enable some discussion on this particular item if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5515)|
| 1:32:00| commission warrants it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| However, if we go too long, I will push this over because we do want to get towards finishing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5522)|
| 1:32:08| this agenda because we've got a very important ethics appointment coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5528)|
| 1:32:12| With that said, Commissioner Beeler has weighed in, Commissioner Carringer has weighed in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| Commissioner Gill, and then Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5538)|
| 1:32:19| I just need to seek some clarification in the language from Commissioner Beeler and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5539)|
| 1:32:26| from the law director so that I can make sure we're on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5546)|
| 1:32:35| Under the first whereas, are we readdressing Knox County's role to increase the pay under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5555)|
| 1:32:45| the defined UR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| Because that's what's listed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| Are we revisiting this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| Because that's what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5574)|
| 1:32:55| My understanding, and of course the lawyer with the case is standing back there, may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| yet be able to answer it better than me, is the county's being sued to determine whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5578)|
| 1:33:05| this body has the power to increase it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5588)|
| 1:33:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5589)|
| 1:33:10| So, is it, one, two, three, four, so the fifth whereas indicates, because the court has ruled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5590)|
| 1:33:24| is there now the clarification from the original suit, because this is what this is, the fifth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5604)|
| 1:33:31| whereas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5611)|
| 1:33:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5612)|
| 1:33:33| Could you read it for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5613)|
| 1:33:34| I have it in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5614)|
| 1:33:35| Whereas, the court has ruled that the Retirement and Pension Board has no interest of its own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| in the UOP or its findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| That's out of the old case, but this is not about the UOP per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5621)|
| 1:33:46| This is about citizens suing the commission to determine whether the commission has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5626)|
| 1:33:53| authority to increase the UOP and other pensions, I think is what you all voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5633)|
| 1:34:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5641)|
| 1:34:02| And that is the clarification I'm seeking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5642)|
| 1:34:03| Is this clear in this resolution to indicate that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5643)|
| 1:34:06| That is what I'm trying to figure out, because it's not from what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5646)|
| 1:34:11| It is what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5654)|
| 1:34:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5655)|
| 1:34:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5656)|
| 1:34:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5657)|
| 1:34:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5658)|
| 1:34:19| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5659)|
| 1:34:20| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5660)|
| 1:34:21| I'm just trying to get some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5661)|
| 1:34:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5662)|
| 1:34:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5663)|
| 1:34:24| Commissioner Beeler, could you take a moment and explain the legislative intent of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5664)|
| 1:34:30| resolution to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| With the chair's permission, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| I kind of want to explain just the heart behind this resolution from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5677)|
| 1:34:42| You know, I don't say much, and I've been here ten months, and I probably haven't said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| a hundred words outside of the Pledge of Allegiance and here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5686)|
| 1:34:50| But I've tried to follow Commissioner Biggs' lead on that, because he spent about six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5690)|
| 1:34:56| didn't say much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5696)|
| 1:34:57| He had more to learn than he had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| And I was kind of the same way when I came on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5699)|
| 1:35:00| The danger in that, though, is you'll lose your own voice if you're not careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| Because all my colleagues know, when you sit in these seats, everybody wants you to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| their guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| You know, people in your community want you to be their guy, the courthouse wants you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5708)|
| 1:35:11| to be their guy, media, whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5711)|
| 1:35:14| And you know, I did a lot of soul searching this week as I was thinking about this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5714)|
| 1:35:20| that you know, the people that put me in this seat did so because they trusted that I wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5720)|
| 1:35:27| anybody's guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| And so, that's the determination I've made, is that I'm going to honor that and not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5729)|
| 1:35:34| anybody's guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5734)|
| 1:35:35| So I'm speaking with my own voice when I speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| First of all, understand the legislative intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| This is not an adversarial resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5739)|
| 1:35:42| I am not bringing this resolution to try to be against the mayor in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5742)|
| 1:35:47| The mayor is not my enemy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5747)|
| 1:35:50| Mayor Jacobs is not my enemy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| You know, I don't know if someone else might have that hope that Mayor Jacobs will fail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5752)|
| 1:35:57| but that has got nothing to do with this resolution whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5757)|
| 1:36:01| This doesn't have anything to do with who the mayor is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5761)|
| 1:36:05| This is really to get a question answered about the rule of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5765)|
| 1:36:09| It's a question that our law director attempted to ask in the previous lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5769)|
| 1:36:14| The previous lawsuit was dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| The legal question about the rule of law never really got answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| I personally don't think our law director is conflicted in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| Now, I respect our chief executive's right to his opinion that he is conflicted and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5785)|
| 1:36:31| why I didn't vote against the mayor's right to hire an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5791)|
| 1:36:35| But personally, I don't think the law director is conflicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| I think the law director just had an opinion that he felt like a question needed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5798)|
| 1:36:44| answered as to the legality of whether or not Knox County can take an article or an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5804)|
| 1:36:49| amendment that's been put into the charter by referendum of the people and change it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5809)|
| 1:36:55| without going back to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| That's a fundamental question that has to do with the rule of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| The rule of law is the most sacred, fundamental thing we have in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5820)|
| 1:37:03| It's what makes us America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| The rule of law is what protects the people from the government just doing whatever it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5826)|
| 1:37:10| wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| We have documents that have the final word on what the government can and cannot do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5832)|
| 1:37:17| Now, sometimes we disagree on what those documents say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| They're pretty simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5840)|
| 1:37:21| I mean, I carry one of them in my pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5841)|
| 1:37:23| The Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| You see, they're on my desk or in my pocket all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| It's simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5846)|
| 1:37:27| It's not even very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5847)|
| 1:37:28| But sometimes we disagree on what they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| That's why we have a judiciary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5850)|
| 1:37:31| And I think that's why this question needs to be answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| Can Knox County, can the commission change something in the charter that was put there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5854)|
| 1:37:38| by the people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5858)|
| 1:37:39| Now, let me just say, I have no desire or intent to take benefits away from anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5859)|
| 1:37:45| None whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5865)|
| 1:37:46| I'm not interested in taking benefits away from our law enforcement people at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5866)|
| 1:37:49| In fact, the courts have already ruled that we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5869)|
| 1:37:53| And I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| I don't think we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| But this is not a question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5876)|
| 1:37:59| You know, I support our law enforcement folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| I'll support a pay increase for them next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| But this is about the rule of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| This is about whether the charter can be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| Look, if this body can change something that's been put into the charter by the people, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5888)|
| 1:38:12| we ought to vote tonight to take term limits off of ourself and everybody else in the courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5892)|
| 1:38:18| Because that was put into the charter by the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| And I don't think this body can change things that are put there by the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5900)|
| 1:38:24| So it comes down, really, to whether or not this body can and should direct the attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5904)|
| 1:38:31| that's been hired by the mayor to ask for an answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5911)|
| 1:38:36| You know, that's complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5916)|
| 1:38:37| I'm not a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| So I don't know the legal answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| I just know that I'm going to vote in such a way that hopefully that question will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5921)|
| 1:38:48| answered for the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| I think it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| I think that it's a fundamental question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| And so that's the legislative intent, is to simply have the question answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5933)|
| 1:38:57| Whether this body can change something in the charter that was put there by the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5937)|
| 1:39:01| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5943)|
| 1:39:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5944)|
| 1:39:05| Thank you, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5945)|
| 1:39:06| You had asked him the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5946)|
| 1:39:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5947)|
| 1:39:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| And I saw, and I guess in summation, you just want to know, you want an answer to the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5949)|
| 1:39:17| And that's all we want to do in an expedited manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| Not to just drag this out and drag this out and drag this out like under the previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| case where there was a lot of stonewalling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5964)|
| 1:39:28| And you know, I guess what bothers me about this whole thing is what is this body afraid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5968)|
| 1:39:33| of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5973)|
| 1:39:34| What are we afraid of that we want to hold back from the taxpayers of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5974)|
| 1:39:40| Why do we not want to have this situation answered in a timely manner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5980)|
| 1:39:45| I see on today's paper here that we now ask for two different delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5985)|
| 1:39:49| And we've appointed an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5989)|
| 1:39:52| So I just want an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| I don't want this thing delayed for another year or the legal fees just racked up like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=5994)|
| 1:40:01| they did in the previous case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| And the good thing about this lawsuit, it's against Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| It's not against the Retirement and Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6006)|
| 1:40:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6011)|
| 1:40:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6012)|
| 1:40:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6013)|
| 1:40:14| Thank you, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6014)|
| 1:40:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6015)|
| 1:40:16| So who all was on Retirement and Pension Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6016)|
| 1:40:21| Well, and when this happened and as it continues to go, because we appoint and those elect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6021)|
| 1:40:30| to be on Retirement and Pension Board, there has to be a great deal of trust from the rest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6030)|
| 1:40:35| of us commissioners to expect for you all and for you all to do the work and to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6035)|
| 1:40:43| sure that procedures are going as to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6043)|
| 1:40:48| I know Evelyn and I, we've never served on that committee the past three years we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6048)|
| 1:40:53| been on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6053)|
| 1:40:54| I never was even per se really given an opportunity, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| So this just all kind of comes up now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6058)|
| 1:41:04| Are we at legal rights to be able to ask the attorney that Mayor Jacobs has hired to tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6064)|
| 1:41:12| him to speed it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| That's only where I'm going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6074)|
| 1:41:15| I'm not afraid of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| Trust me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6077)|
| 1:41:18| This was all being done before I was apparently elected and it's been going on and we knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6078)|
| 1:41:24| nothing about it until it came to us saying that we had been sued about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6084)|
| 1:41:31| So all I want is the truth and it to be done legally and correctly for everyone involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6091)|
| 1:41:43| So I don't think anybody sitting up here on Knox County Commission is afraid of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6103)|
| 1:41:49| We want the truth and we want it done right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6109)|
| 1:41:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6111)|
| 1:41:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6112)|
| 1:41:53| Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6113)|
| 1:41:54| Let's start moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6114)|
| 1:41:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6115)|
| 1:41:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6116)|
| 1:41:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6117)|
| 1:41:58| Madam Clerk, what's the next item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6118)|
| 1:42:02| I know I want to get back to item 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| I also want to clarify for commission item 31 and 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6124)|
| 1:42:09| We discussed it to Finance Committee briefly where Commissioner Schoonmaker as Finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6129)|
| 1:42:14| Chair reminded all of us to Finance Committee that the representative from our financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6134)|
| 1:42:21| advisors would be here at the meeting next week to talk in more detail about items 31| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6141)|
| 1:42:27| and 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6147)|
| 1:42:28| So I do want to, just because it's involving the interest rates and all that, while I pulled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6148)|
| 1:42:34| it at the beginning, I would like to have a vote to make sure we are officially sending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6154)|
| 1:42:40| items 31 and 32 forward with no recommendation to be discussed at next week's meeting when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6160)|
| 1:42:47| we have the financial advisors here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6167)|
| 1:42:49| So could I get a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6169)|
| 1:42:50| Motion to send 31 and 32 without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6173)|
| 1:42:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6174)|
| 1:42:55| We have a motion from our two Finance, from the Finance Chair and the Finance Vice Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| from Commissioner Schoonmaker and Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6180)|
| 1:43:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6181)|
| 1:43:02| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6182)|
| 1:43:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6183)|
| 1:43:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6184)|
| 1:43:05| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6185)|

| 1:43:07| On page 7, item number 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6187)|
| 1:43:08| Consideration of a resolution to amend and reinstate the Knoxville-Farragut-Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6188)|
| 1:43:18| Growth Policy Plan, resolution 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6198)|
| 1:43:22| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6202)|
| 1:43:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6203)|
| 1:43:24| We have a motion for approval by Commissioner Smith and is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6204)|
| 1:43:29| Can we make it to send without recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| We haven't read it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6211)|
| 1:43:32| Completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6212)|
| 1:43:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6213)|
| 1:43:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6214)|
| 1:43:35| Commissioner Smith, would you like to revise that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6215)|
| 1:43:36| Or I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6216)|
| 1:43:37| Either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6217)|
| 1:43:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6218)|
| 1:43:39| Well, you don't have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6219)|
| 1:43:40| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6220)|
| 1:43:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6221)|
| 1:43:42| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6222)|
| 1:43:43| The motion did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6223)|
| 1:43:44| Have you revised your motion to send forward with no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6224)|
| 1:43:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| And is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6228)|
| 1:43:49| There's a second from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6229)|
| 1:43:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6230)|
| 1:43:51| Do we want to have any discussion on this one tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6231)|
| 1:43:52| Or would the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6232)|
| 1:43:53| I'm inclined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6233)|
| 1:43:54| We're coming right up at the Ethics Committee and I'd kind of like to move this one to next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6234)|
| 1:43:58| week to have some more intentional discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| What I will also do, I personally added the discussion item 47 to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6241)|
| 1:44:07| I think that next week when we're discussing item 40, those two items, while not directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6247)|
| 1:44:13| related, they're close cousins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6253)|
| 1:44:15| And I would suspect that when we cover some of the discussion on item 40, the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6255)|
| 1:44:21| item that I've added about the county growth and general plans may overlap with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6261)|
| 1:44:25| I also want to, as we've talked about Chairman's briefings, when we did our planning session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6265)|
| 1:44:31| this summer, one of the top items that we identified was updating our planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6271)|
| 1:44:37| We've got an awful lot of things that may be covered in this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6277)|
| 1:44:40| So I'll look forward to getting to it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| Knox County Planning Alliance also recently sent us a lot of information that I'd encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6282)|
| 1:44:48| the commission to review between now and next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6288)|
| 1:44:52| Now, the motion before us came from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6292)|
| 1:44:57| It was to send forward no recommendation and it was seconded by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6297)|
| 1:45:01| Commissioner Smith, any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| Not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6304)|
| 1:45:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6305)|
| 1:45:06| Commissioner Gill, sorry, that's your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6306)|
| 1:45:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6307)|
| 1:45:08| This is like a good light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| So my observation also would be, thank you, Mr. Chairman, is to make sure we have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6310)|
| 1:45:14| language from the Town of Farragut as well as the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6314)|
| 1:45:19| Wait, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6319)|
| 1:45:20| It's the same language going before all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6320)|
| 1:45:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6324)|
| 1:45:25| But if we, if I'll wait to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6328)|
| 1:45:29| Because I think those are some critical components as resolution number 47 overall, as we look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6329)|
| 1:45:36| to that growth policy plan, that we have some more information to make the best decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6336)|
| 1:45:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6340)|
| 1:45:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6341)|
| 1:45:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6342)|
| 1:45:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6343)|
| 1:45:44| All in favor of this motion, which is properly before us, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6344)|
| 1:45:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6345)|
| 1:45:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6346)|
| 1:45:47| I'm sorry, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6347)|
| 1:45:48| I didn't see his light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6348)|
| 1:45:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6350)|
| 1:45:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6351)|
| 1:45:52| John, any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6352)|
| 1:45:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6353)|
| 1:45:54| We'll save it for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| Are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6355)|
| 1:45:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6356)|
| 1:45:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6358)|
| 1:45:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6359)|
| 1:46:00| All in favor of this motion, which is properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6360)|
| 1:46:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6361)|
| 1:46:02| Ms. Poblin, if you'd like to go ahead and approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6362)|
| 1:46:03| It's Louise Poblin, 12830 Stull Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6363)|
| 1:46:06| We aren't due to speak about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| I think it's going to be on our November 14th Board of Mayor and Aldermen agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6369)|
| 1:46:13| So I'm not sure that, obviously, we won't have anything to give you for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6373)|
| 1:46:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6377)|
| 1:46:18| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6378)|

| 1:46:32| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6392)|
| 1:46:33| This was an item that was added to the agenda earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6393)|
| 1:46:34| It's an appointment of Commissioner Biggs to the 9-1-1 Board to complete the term of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6394)|
| 1:46:40| Commissioner Anders, who has resigned due to being selected as the new director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6400)|
| 1:46:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| I'd like to abstain from this vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6410)|
| 1:46:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| And Commissioner Biggs, do you want to abstain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6412)|
| 1:46:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6413)|
| 1:46:54| You can vote for yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6414)|
| 1:46:55| No, I'd say just vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6415)|
| 1:46:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6416)|
| 1:46:57| I'd love to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6417)|
| 1:46:58| I appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021?start=6418)|
