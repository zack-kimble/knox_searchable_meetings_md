| 0:02:59| Item 11M, I had a request to postpone for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| That is one of the annexations. Voluntary, I might add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=183)|
| 0:03:07| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=187)|
| 0:03:08| We only do voluntary annexations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| Okay, there's a motion and a second to postpone 11M for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=192)|

| 0:03:41| For the Mayor's report, I want to start, excuse me, start by asking our law director to introduce the person who's sitting next to him, one of our interns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=221)|
| 0:03:50| I'm delighted to introduce you to Sanjay Raman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| Sanjay is a third-year student at LMU Law School and has expressed an interest in municipal law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=234)|
| 0:04:02| and he is spending some time in the law department over the summer to discover why that was a very bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=242)|
| 0:04:10| Now, now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| Public service is a wonderful career, just for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=254)|
| 0:04:20| And this was said by somebody who's gone to council meetings for how many years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| About 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| About 35. Apparently there's something good about it, Sanjay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| Okay, so welcome, Sanjay. It's great working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| So we will hold our 11th annual business breakfast tomorrow morning, Wednesday, June 19th, at the Jacob Building in Chilhowee Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=273)|
| 0:04:42| Starts at 730 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| We'll start the program at 8, but come at 730 if you want to have breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| And it goes on until about 1130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| There's no charge to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| So note, this is a new location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| We usually have it at the Civic Coliseum, but because we have construction going on right now in the auditorium and coliseum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=295)|
| 0:05:02| we're moving it to Chilhowee Park to the Jacob Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| So we invite business folks to come learn about the $100 million or so in contracts that would be put out for bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=306)|
| 0:05:14| in the next year and a half by the city and our partners, such as CAT, KUB, KCDC, and PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=314)|
| 0:05:22| After breakfast, you'll learn about projects and services to be bid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=322)|
| 0:05:26| This event is for all businesses, but it is especially geared to help small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| and for those businesses unfamiliar with the city's bid process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| It's a good opportunity for local businesses and those owned by women, minorities, and service-disabled veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=335)|
| 0:05:42| to get one-on-one help in navigating through the red tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| Again, the free business breakfast is tomorrow, Wednesday, June 19th, at Chilhowee Park from 730 to 1130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=346)|
| 0:05:54| You can also visit KnoxvilleTN.gov slash business breakfast, all one word, for more details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=354)|
| 0:06:02| So coming up this Saturday, June 22nd, will be Knox Pride Fest and the Knox Pride Parade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=362)|
| 0:06:08| and we want to extend a warm welcome to everyone who comes downtown for that, whether you're local or from out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=368)|
| 0:06:19| I know many council members will be down there, either at the parade or at the celebration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=379)|
| 0:06:24| and I'm pleased that Chip Berry, our deputy chief of operations and my LGBT liaison to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=384)|
| 0:06:33| will be a grand marshal for the 10.30 a.m. Pride Parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| And then Deputy to the Mayor Bill Lyons will be giving welcoming remarks, as he has done in past years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=397)|
| 0:06:44| Following the parade, Pride Fest will be held at Mary Costa Plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| That's where the remarks will be, and that goes on until 8 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| It's always a great event and very well attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| And it's going to be particularly important this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| based on the hateful anti-LGBTQ plus statements that were made, that we know were made earlier, a few days ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=417)|
| 0:07:06| by a pastor and a sheriff's detective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| That made local and national headlines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| I can tell you I got a lot of e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| Mostly local people know what we as a community have done and that that does not reflect us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=434)|
| 0:07:21| but word spreads far and wide, and we got a lot of e-mails from people who said they were going to cancel their trip to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=441)|
| 0:07:28| or they were, you know, would never move their business here, or whatever it is that they were considering doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=448)|
| 0:07:35| So we've tried to be very proactive in responding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| I made a statement, which I think you all would have seen, to make it clear the kinds of steps we have taken in the last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=458)|
| 0:07:45| just in our last seven and a half years, to make sure that our community was welcoming and diverse and inclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=465)|
| 0:07:53| So a few examples that we mentioned in that press release was that in 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=473)|
| 0:08:00| council voted to expand our nondiscrimination ordinance for city employees to include sexual orientation and gender identity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=480)|
| 0:08:09| Since 2014, the city of Knoxville has offered equal health, dental, vision, and life insurance benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=489)|
| 0:08:16| for LGBTQ plus and other city employees who are registered in domestic partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=496)|
| 0:08:22| And both Chief Thomas and I have staff assigned as liaisons to the LGBT community to foster relationships and to respond to any issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=502)|
| 0:08:31| And in 2015, as a member of the Mayors Against LGBT Discrimination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=511)|
| 0:08:37| I joined with several hundred mayors across the country to sign on to an amicus brief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| and supported the marriage equality case that was before Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| and was ultimately decided in favor of marriage equality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| So we've taken these and many other steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| And if you go to our website, to KnoxvilleTN.gov slash LGBTQ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=533)|
| 0:09:01| you can learn more about some of the actions that the city has taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| So meanwhile, this year's Pride Fest commemorates the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots and the first Pride March in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=546)|
| 0:09:15| And I want people to know that our police department and Chief Thomas are committed to the safety of all those in attendance on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=555)|
| 0:09:23| So we want to encourage everyone to come down to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| And by the way, there will be many churches who will be there as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| who are walking in the Pride Parade or will be attending to show support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| And there always has been and will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| So come on downtown to the parade or to the festival or both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| All right, so moving on from there, we have a community-wide survey that is underway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| on possible future uses of Chilhowee Park and Exposition Center, and we need everyone's help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=589)|
| 0:09:55| The survey continues through June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| The easiest way to access the survey is to go to the city's website, KnoxvilleTN.gov,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| and at the top of the homepage is a red bar that says, Take the Chilhowee Park and Exposition Center Survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=603)|
| 0:10:11| Click where it says Learn More, and you'll be directed to links to the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| You can also find direct links on the city of Knoxville and on my mayor Facebook pages and tweets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=616)|
| 0:10:24| So we have a consulting team named Conventions, Sports, and Leisure International.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| They've been hired by the city to review the current uses of Chilhowee Park and existing market conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=629)|
| 0:10:36| They're gathering extensive community input and then will develop a strategic business plan and a facility plan for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=636)|
| 0:10:44| So CSL will present its recommendation at a public meeting this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| So please help them gather community input by responding to that public survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=649)|
| 0:10:55| Lastly, we have several important public meetings coming up, four this week and one next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=655)|
| 0:11:02| So the city is hosting a series of open house workshops to gather feedback from people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=662)|
| 0:11:08| and introduce the goals of our 10-month sidewalk system study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| that will evaluate existing and future pedestrian needs, including sidewalks and crosswalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| The last four open house workshops are from 5 to 7 p.m. on the following days and at these locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=678)|
| 0:11:25| So on Wednesday, that's tomorrow, June 19th, they'll be at South Doyle Middle School Library on Decatur Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=685)|
| 0:11:34| and at the Larry Cox Senior Center in North Knoxville on Ocoee Trail, 5 to 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=694)|

| 0:11:48| and then at the Cumberland Estates Recreation Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| Again, those are on Thursday from 5 to 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| Okay, and then the next meeting or presentation is on Monday, June 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=717)|

| 0:17:29| Bruce Spangler, 511 North Broadway, CEO of the Volunteer Ministry Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| In my conversations with construction companies, we look between a six-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| So as soon as I have the money, I can begin that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| So you're still doing permitting and getting estimates and stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| And just for the public, we've got a shelter, why do we need this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1073)|
| 0:18:00| Yes, it's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| As we know, the folks who were normally hanging out under the I-40 overpass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| were actually within a stone's throw of all the resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| In a survey, we found that for some who had social phobias,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| to go into a large crowd was problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| For others, thought that relative to their addiction disorder and their active addiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1098)|
| 0:18:24| the low barrier shelter would not permit for folks to use on the campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| but there is no testing relative to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| We also know that some folks have to be split up at the traditional shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1111)|
| 0:18:38| and here where folks couple up for safety reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| they'll be in the same building in the same location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| That's one of the many reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| but I think the most important thing is that this is more than just emergency shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| It is housing-focused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| So everybody who participates in this program has to be referred by a street outreach worker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1132)|
| 0:18:58| so as not to compete with the traditional shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| and second of all, they will be assigned a housing case manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| to help them find permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| As you know, the city of Knoxville has been gracious with your support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1147)|
| 0:19:12| of the street outreach program that we have been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| We have engaged over 400 people at least one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| and relative to those, we now have probably about 60% of those who have exited that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1159)|
| 0:19:27| now have housing case managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| In addition, eight of those individuals have achieved housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| So this low-barrier overnight emergency shelter is just another component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| to meet the need that often we refer to as hard-to-reach folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| I hope that addresses it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| Right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| I just think obviously we've made the difficult decision of opening the day space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| and clearing that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| and I think this is in response to that to help provide those resources that are needed for this population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1191)|
| 0:19:59| and the path to housing I think is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| Right. It's a great complimentary service that we'll provide to what's already there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| with the emergency shelter and all the other services that are provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| So thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| We really appreciate that VMC has taken this on and is taking and running with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1212)|
| 0:20:18| It's going to be a great service for the folks who need it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| We're up to the task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| I'll let Councilman Wallace go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| I just want to make a note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| I mean, this is a one-time contribution for us, $245,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| Right. This is a capital, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| This is capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| Capital fee, not for operating, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| Correct. This is capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| VMC and it would also fall on, oh, my gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1242)|
| 0:20:50| Salvation Army.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| Salvation Army.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| The two of you all combined and would come together to work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| And that's another point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| It's a partnership between Salvation Army and VMC, so it's great to see that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| Dr. Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| A couple more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| I was trying to flag you back over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| and I addressed you correctly this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| So really quickly, this also includes restrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| Was that part of the original?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| Is that to replace the porta potties that are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| So we'll see those leave, and so they'll have day access to these bathrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| That's correct. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Then one thing I would like you, because it is a component of this, the street outreach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| I've reached out to you before by email about street outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| Can you just elaborate very briefly about the street outreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| and how they identify where to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| Do they make circuits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| Because, you know, I've asked you and your response for them to go to certain locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| and the response was, oh, they've been going to that area and connecting with the homeless there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| and they were getting someone into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| That's one of the requests that I get from constituents and business owners in the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| is because things changed in the area under the bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| and by no means was what was happening thereby acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| How are they making these connections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| How are they spreading themselves out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| Because what we've seen is the homeless have moved to different areas and pockets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| because they're transient, and so we're getting a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| I'm getting a lot of requests, and I pass those on to you as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| But I'm curious how the street outreach team is working to be able to connect people to the shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| and to identify where folks are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| There's probably about three different avenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| We know that folks have moved to the Blackstock area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| and have been visiting those overpasses as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| There is a contingency that meet in the Fort Sanders area, so we go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| And oftentimes we go where other providers request us to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| One of the values that we've discovered about this is that, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| for Helen Ross McNabb has a caseworker looking for one of their clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1382)|
| 0:23:09| They will engage our street outreach to say, if you see Joe, please pass him on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| So they're just kind of making a circuit around the whole city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| and at the same time we don't know every place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| and so to get calls from you or from the Office on Homelessness is very valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| We'll be glad to reach out as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| Thank you, Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1415)|

| 0:24:49| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| Mr. Hagerman, there's a lot of properties that back up to this drainage ditch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1491)|
| 0:24:58| or you call it the cavern, right, or canyon, I think you call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| Yeah, the canyon, the Grand Canyon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| We approved one a few months ago for the Regas property down on Paper Mill, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1503)|
| 0:25:09| We gave some money for their project, for them to open that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| Again, this is private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| How do we analyze that and say these people get this much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| and these people get that much and these people don't get anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| How do you make that determination?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| What's the outline of that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| I'm Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| There's a lot of things that go into that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| The biggest one, whether or not they get funding, is the impact to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| In this particular case, it's probably the biggest pollution source in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| so it does have a big effect on the community in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| and we feel that that's worth putting city resources into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| As far as the amount goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| we're usually limited by just the resources we have available as a department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| And that's what we had to contribute to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| So it was about an $800,000 project, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| And then we're putting in $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| But a lot of deliberation was given, right, Mr. Brace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| I mean, you and I have talked about this quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| Yeah, I think the impact of the water quality, I think this is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| This isn't about quantity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| This is about water quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| The reason we're engaged is the overall big picture of quality of our streams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| and the water systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| And so the Grand Canyon is a great example of a very large project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| that is really one of the number one locations for the silt that's coming into that stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1598)|
| 0:26:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| So we've wanted to tackle that for some time, but it is on private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| It is challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| So we work with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| Anytime we work on private property, we want to make sure that we're dotting our I's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| crossing our T's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| The purchasing department helps us with the estimate, our participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| But we've got several of these, and we're really limited by the resources to put into those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| But both of these are important for this stream, especially this Grand Canyon project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| It's the most significant challenge we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| Is that right, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| And it's both the impacts on the water quality and the critters that try to live in that water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1636)|
| 0:27:24| but it also has a big impact on our infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| There is sediment that settles out in our pipes that we have to clean out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| It can cause local flooding downstream because those pipes are clogged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| It saves us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| I mean, it just has a lot of general community impacts aside from the private property impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1658)|
| 0:27:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190618?start=1666)|
