| 0:04:35| First, it's good to see you. And I am glad to be convening again here on Zoom and glad that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=275)|
| 0:04:42| have the opportunity to meet by Zoom because also we are experiencing a spike in COVID cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=282)|
| 0:04:48| which some of you I'm sure are all of you are aware of. For most of August, we kept our new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=288)|
| 0:04:54| cases down to under 100 per day. But this weekend, we saw a frightening uptick in cases. And on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=294)|
| 0:05:01| Sunday, the Health Department reported its highest single day increase ever, 222 new cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=301)|
| 0:05:07| Today, we're back down. I mean, relatively speaking, I guess we can be glad that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=307)|
| 0:05:13| down under 100, only 81 new cases today. But health officials anticipate another spike following the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=313)|
| 0:05:20| gatherings from Labor Day weekend. We've had spikes following Memorial Day weekend, 4th of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=320)|
| 0:05:27| There's been a lot of effort to curtail closed gatherings and confined spaces. And,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=327)|
| 0:05:34| you know, hopefully, we'll see, hopefully, some people were listening or that's the thing is we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| hope most people were listening and we don't see a spike in a few weeks. But things look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| they're trending in a more disturbing direction. So the city of Knoxville, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=345)|
| 0:05:51| and you've been part of has been very vigilant. And we've been following COVID safety protocols| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=351)|
| 0:05:56| since the beginning. And we encourage everybody to continue to remain vigilant and follow those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=356)|
| 0:06:02| five core actions. On the same topic of the pandemic, I want to make sure city council and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=362)|
| 0:06:09| the public are aware of two funding opportunities to help our community respond to the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=369)|
| 0:06:16| The first is the new Knox County COVID-19 response fund mini grant opportunity from United Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=376)|

| 0:07:05| partnerships comes from 2.2 million in supplemental ESG or emergency solutions grants from the Federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=425)|
| 0:07:13| CARES Act. And we hope that this opportunity will encourage innovation and partnerships between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| organizations to meet a mix of community needs and strengthen the network of area providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=438)|

| 0:25:05| you're going to be very close to the 120-day rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1505)|

| 0:25:12| it's though it's been denied regardless of how you act on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1512)|

| 0:28:35| But it's a good step, I think, into making technology be a tool that can be social but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1715)|
| 0:28:42| also productive and streamlined for us inside the city and most importantly for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1722)|
| 0:28:49| Mr. Roberto, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| Director Jensen, I had a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| Are you seeing maybe some requests for services out there that you feel like might be getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| missed from folks not, you know, using the call center right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| And do you anticipate the app helping with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| I don't know that I'd say that we're missing service requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| Russ, could you identify yourself for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| I'm sorry, Russ Jensen, 305 Portsmouth Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1763)|
| 0:29:30| I wouldn't say we're missing service requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| However, if people are on their way home and they see something, pothole, light out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1772)|
| 0:29:39| they may wait till the next morning or maybe by the next morning they forget, they get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| busy, they got to get the kids to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| So in that context, I would say it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| This gives them 24-hour, 24-7 access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| It gives them the ability to basically point, click and send via picture and it's geocoded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1793)|
| 0:30:00| by wherever their smart device or phone is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| So it's reaching out to people where they're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| When we built 311, we kind of designed it around senior citizens who really wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| talk to somebody live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| But obviously, we have a much bigger and more tech-savvy community than we did 16, 17, 18| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1814)|
| 0:30:21| years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| And people have really been asking for this for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1829)|
| 0:30:29| Mayor, I have one more question, but I see some of my colleagues have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| So I'll wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1836)|
| 0:30:36| Raise your hand if you have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| I couldn't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| Oh, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| It's kind of more general about 311, but I think it's relevant for this app and for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1845)|
| 0:30:52| described use of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| I noticed that in other cities, you can not only submit a service request or a complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1856)|
| 0:31:06| but also submit feedback about an interaction with a city employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1866)|
| 0:31:14| And I wondered about incorporating that into the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1874)|
| 0:31:21| Reason being because I, you know, I receive calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| And if I receive a call about, you know, a concerning interaction between a public service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| worker and a member of the community, I call Chad West and he's great, you know, and he'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1890)|
| 0:31:37| work on it and he'll offer to give his number out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| But there's, you know, by the time all of that happens, like you all have said, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| not the day of the incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| You know, all of the details of what happened, where it happened are often lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1910)|
| 0:31:57| What are some thoughts around incorporating that into this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| It's actually a fantastic question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| Believe it or not, we get some of that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| People put those in on the web under a miscellaneous request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| And then we pass that along to whichever department it pertains to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| But in using this app, they would be able to do that directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| We would create it and it would look something like a service request would now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| But it would be categorized specifically for employee interaction or departmental concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| or something to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| So, yes, I know several cities that use their mobile apps that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| And it's a fantastic point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| Council Member Parker, I would just say, if I could just say that when you do hear about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| things like that, please let me or one of my deputies know so we can know what's being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| reported and, you know, look into it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| Because, you know, I want to make sure we are very responsive and courteous and professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1967)|
| 0:32:54| and know what the community's interactions are like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1974)|
| 0:33:00| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| Do you have any more, Ms. Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| No, that was my only question, just my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| Well, we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| We'll look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| My last question is for Mark Parker, Chief Technology Officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| And, you know, looking at this and considering the fact that we're still going through a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| malware event, you know, we're what I want to ask you about is we're opening up another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2005)|
| 0:33:31| window into our system and just wanted to, you know, ask you about whether there's any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2011)|
| 0:33:38| potential exposure because of that and what steps we're taking to address those given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2018)|
| 0:33:45| our current circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| Councilman Roberto, I don't think Mark is on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| I'm covering for Mark today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| But the answer to your question, the vendor is hosting it on their cloud separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2032)|
| 0:34:00| So, by the time it comes to us through Accela, which is our work order asset management system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| it's already been filtered once through and they have, that was one of the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| of the RFP, they have to format it to go into our current system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| So, it's not that people can access it directly through the app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| They're going through the vendor, through the cloud, and they've got their security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| So, our IT department is very confident that the vendor that we chose has got it set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| very securely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| That was one of their big issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| Thank you, Mr. Jensen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| Mr. Jensen, what does a successful utilization rate look like for the vendor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2076)|
| 0:34:42| Something like this in other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| What percentage of our population should we hope would use it a year or two from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| Currently, you're seeing cities go from anywhere from 2% to 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| But that grows every single year as more and more people are using smart devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| In particular, I go back to our original client base, our senior citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| 15 years ago, senior citizens weren't using smart devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| Now, they're using tablets, smartphones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| Like, matter of fact, before COVID-19 broke out, O'Connor Senior Center was doing two and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| three classes for senior citizens a week, teaching them how to use smartphones and tablets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| So, we anticipate that growing more and more each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2123)|
| 0:35:23| That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| Thank you, Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| This cost is for setting up, and for the first year, are there annual costs involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2131)|
| 0:35:37| And will we be going with the same contractor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| I would have to go back to purchasing on this, but I think we're good for three years on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2150)|
| 0:35:50| Any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2150)|

| 0:40:38| When the mayor calls on her, then I'll...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2440)|

| 0:40:44| I just would like it if you guys, are your schools doing anything that you could succinctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2444)|
| 0:40:51| tell us about in response to COVID and helping the schools other than just extra manpower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2451)|
| 0:40:57| I'm just wondering how that's impacting what your staff does or how they're able to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2457)|
| 0:41:04| Well, it's interesting in schools right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| Manpower is the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| I mean, if you really want to get down to brass tacks, that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| It is manpower and having enough folks to cover all of the spots because this is impacting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2476)|
| 0:41:24| between...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| But it's not just the positive tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| It's our folks that need to be quarantined and making sure that we have the appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2487)|
| 0:41:31| coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| Our team has, throughout COVID-19, provided ongoing supports for families and students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2493)|
| 0:41:41| throughout the entire time, across section of everything that you can think of from health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2501)|
| 0:41:49| and wellness to referrals for various services and almost case management of helping families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2509)|
| 0:41:55| get what they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| But right now, physically located inside of schools, it is different in every single school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2517)|
| 0:42:04| what the needs are based on what their staff census count is for that day and that week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2524)|
| 0:42:14| Council Member Hugo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| I just wanted to go on record and say I'll be voting for this, but the Girl Scouts actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| partners with community schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| And one of the things I would say to speak to what Councilwoman Ryder was asking, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2546)|
| 0:42:33| we're doing virtual Girl Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| We typically go and do a troop meeting at their site and our staff, we pay for the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2555)|
| 0:42:42| This year, their staff is going to facilitate a virtual meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| We'll get them the supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| They'll do the Girl Scout troop meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| But our staff member will be virtually providing the lesson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| So they're being very flexible, very much trying to include those of us that are part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| of social and emotional well-being for children in addition to the academic support, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| is one of the best things that the community schools does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| It does both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| The Girl Scouts are an important partner, and we have lots of partners who are really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| working very hard to provide ongoing virtual supports and enrichments for our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2597)|
| 0:43:23| for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| And Council, you may have seen that the school system has announced that even if a particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2605)|
| 0:43:32| school has to close down due to quarantining of many staff members, they're going to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2612)|
| 0:43:38| youth service providers, maybe including the community schools people, to use the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2618)|
| 0:43:47| buildings for people who are not required to be quarantined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| So I thought that was really good news because there's a lot of buildings and a lot of kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| and families who aren't needing to be quarantined but need some place to have a safe, enriching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2634)|
| 0:44:02| experience during the school day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| So anyhow, any further questions for our friends with the Knox Education Foundation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=2644)|

| 0:51:12| Mayor, could we, before we move on this one, could we have someone just to briefly give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| an overview of the increase in the cost for the public, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| Mr. Cannon, our Director of Engineering, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| If you could give Councilmembers an overview of this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| Thank you, Mayor and Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| Harold Cannon, Director, Department of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| This change order basically has four elements to it outside of the extension of contract time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3098)|
| 0:51:45| And while it's about 8% of the original contract amount, these are things that could not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| foreseen prior to getting under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| Probably the minor one, quite frankly, is the issue with conflicts with AT&T that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3113)|
| 0:52:00| been worked around and dealt with, but it did require some change in dollars in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3120)|
| 0:52:07| contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| The major ones fall into the other three categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| First is the unsuitable soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| And basically, the unsuitable soil component is, as we got into construction, this is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| unusual in downtown situations, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| It does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| I believe it happened on the Market Square project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| But way back when, particularly given the change in elevations that our city has had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3149)|
| 0:52:34| downtown with fill and those type things, sometimes soil that was not load-bearing or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3154)|
| 0:52:41| ideal load-bearing soil was used as backfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| Some of that has been uncovered on this project and needs to be replaced with a more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3164)|
| 0:52:50| load-bearing type soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| The other material, the unsuitable, is removed and taken off site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3172)|
| 0:52:57| Second item is the, during the demolition of the ramps, the bridge supports were uncovered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3177)|
| 0:53:06| and they were found, they needed help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| They were in poor condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| This addresses that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| The final one has to do with the retaining wall to basically hold in place the armature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3194)|
| 0:53:21| building foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| That sounds like a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| Quite frankly, if it hadn't been dealt with the way it was, it would have been a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| But this is not uncommon in downtown settings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| Again, unfortunately, it just happens that the foundation of that building was shallower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3213)|
| 0:53:39| than had been anticipated, could be anticipated until we got into construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3219)|
| 0:53:47| We'd known it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| It was dealt with probably identical to the way we have dealt with it during construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| With respect to funding, this is 100% federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| No local dollars go to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| That's good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| And if you'll pardon my phraseology, it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| We're going to treat this as if it was 100% city dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| But this is a federal project and this change order will be funded through the federal system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3247)|
| 0:54:17| Thank you, Mr. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| Vice Mayor McKenzie, do you have any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| I don't know if my colleagues have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3262)|

| 0:54:36| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| I think Mr. Cannon covered the basis pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3283)|

| 0:59:12| the amount for wastewater and water is relatively small compared to the electric system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3552)|
| 0:59:20| In total, it's probably around $1.6 million, $1.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3560)|
| 0:59:27| So we do intend to absorb that, and we do that through managing our cost, through deferring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3567)|
| 0:59:35| projects over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| So we don't anticipate that there will be any rate action or further debt action associated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3578)|
| 0:59:47| that for the water and wastewater systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| You did mention that we, I think we had, well, we did have the media event last week that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3590)|
| 0:59:56| we announced that there was somewhat over $4 million in available assistance for customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3596)|
| 1:00:02| who are struggling to pay their bills as a result of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3602)|
| 1:00:06| I think good news on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| In addition, we just found out, I guess, late last week that CAC has been approved for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3608)|
| 1:00:15| grant of $600,000 for all of that to go for utility bill assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| So that will help as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| And then TVA announced a couple of weeks ago a pandemic relief credit that will be spread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3622)|
| 1:00:28| throughout the Tennessee Valley, of which KEB will get a portion of that, and our portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| should be around $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| And our plan is to use that over time to help our customers struggling with bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3635)|
| 1:00:40| So I think that there is, I would say, a fair amount of financial assistance available for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3640)|
| 1:00:46| our customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| Our focus now is to making sure all those that are struggling to pay their bills are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3648)|
| 1:00:52| aware of it and educate the customers on that and try to make it as easy as possible for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3652)|
| 1:00:58| them to get the assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| So I think working together with our community partner agencies and also with the city, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3660)|
| 1:01:05| think we can really hopefully minimize the impact of that on our customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3665)|
| 1:01:10| Great update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3670)|

| 1:01:33| Any further questions on this agenda, Ms. Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| This pandemic is going to be going on for a while, and I don't think people's financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| situation is unfortunately going to be improving too quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3703)|
| 1:01:49| I'm wondering if when the advisory council that KEB is putting together, I know it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3709)|
| 1:01:56| supposed to be together by January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| I'm just wondering where that is and if this might be a part of what they look at, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3718)|
| 1:02:04| the ongoing issue about people not being able to pay their bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3724)|
| 1:02:11| Yes, Council Member Singh, I anticipate it will be an issue that will be on the minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| and will be talked about with the community advisory panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| As far as where that is, we are still looking at the composition of the panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3739)|
| 1:02:27| As you may recall, the board at their meeting in August adopted a resolution that established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3747)|
| 1:02:34| the community advisory panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| They will come back in October and adopt a second resolution that will actually approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3756)|
| 1:02:42| the, I guess, the composition, the members of the panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3762)|
| 1:02:47| So that is currently being looked at, and I know, I think you're all aware that Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3767)|
| 1:02:52| Bill Lyons will be the facilitator for the panel, and I believe later this week, Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3772)|
| 1:02:57| Lyons and our President and CEO, Gabe Bolas, and some other staff members are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3777)|
| 1:03:03| meet with Mayor Kincannon and her staff and talk about the makeup of the panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| And then that meeting will be followed up with outreach to council to solicit your input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3787)|
| 1:03:12| and particularly for the neighborhood representatives that will sit on the panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| So it's in progress, but, yes, you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| We do anticipate the panel kicking off in January, and we certainly anticipate low income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3800)|
| 1:03:27| bill issues will be one of probably the initial topics that the panel will want to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3807)|
| 1:03:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3814)|
| 1:03:34| Thank you, Mr. Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3814)|

| 1:03:40| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| So the details in the email from Mr. Bolas, this is the final project that is specified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3822)|
| 1:03:51| under the consent decree, the borrowing for these bonds that we're specifically approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3831)|
| 1:03:58| maybe in the next agenda item, because we're approving two agenda items tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3838)|
| 1:04:05| Mr. Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| There is a resolution to approve wastewater bonds not to exceed $30 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| and then another resolution to approve water bonds not to exceed $17 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3851)|
| 1:04:17| particularly for the wastewater system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| Part of the proceeds will fund the final project that's required under the federal consent decree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3859)|
| 1:04:25| for our wastewater system, and that is a project to basically implement an alternative treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3865)|
| 1:04:31| system at our Kauai Wastewater Treatment Plant down off Naland Drive, and that is a project that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3871)|
| 1:04:36| was specifically mandated under the federal consent decree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3876)|
| 1:04:40| So the proceeds will go to help fund the final stages of that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3880)|
| 1:04:45| That's for the wastewater bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| Then that wraps up what was decreed under the consent decree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3892)|
| 1:04:52| The consent decree is due to expire in 2021, I believe by June of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3892)|
| 1:05:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=3901)|

| 1:10:26| But looking through this, it looks like the rate per ton has actually decreased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4226)|
| 1:10:31| And I guess I wanted to know if you could comment on how that occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4231)|
| 1:10:40| I'm Chad Wess, Public Service Director for City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4240)|
| 1:10:44| Yeah, the rate that was ‑‑ there were two proposals that came to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| And we evaluated those proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| And the rate per ton did decrease based on what our previous contract was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4252)|
| 1:10:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4258)|
| 1:10:58| And Director Wess, you know, looking at the amount of the tons of trash per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4258)|
| 1:11:06| have we seen, you know, all of our efforts with recycling, have we seen some decrease in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4266)|
| 1:11:12| amount of waste that's being sent to the landfill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| You know, can you comment a little bit for us on how our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| recycling program is working to affect that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4278)|
| 1:11:23| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4283)|
| 1:11:23| And Patience Melnyk is also on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| She might add some as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| We really have ‑‑ I mean, definitely we've seen a large increase in recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4287)|
| 1:11:31| We track all of our diversion rates as far as even with brush and leaves and recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4291)|
| 1:11:37| We've seen a huge increase in recycling over the years as our program has expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4297)|
| 1:11:43| As far as the amount of waste, it has stayed fairly flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4303)|
| 1:11:47| And that is not just household waste, but also waste coming out of our transfer station as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4307)|
| 1:11:53| And again, Patience, if you're on the call and want to add anything to that, please feel free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| Patience Melnyk, Waste and Resources Manager for Public Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4319)|
| 1:12:04| And I just want to say that just overall, the city is doing great in terms of recycling and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4324)|
| 1:12:16| you know, our leaf and brush program that's really strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| We are, you know, recycling that recycling and that green material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4340)|
| 1:12:27| That's 46%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4347)|
| 1:12:28| If we're just looking at just curbside services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| If we're not looking at what's coming in through the transfer station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| Versus the national average is 35%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4354)|
| 1:12:38| When you break it down, though, that's because our leaf and brush is really excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| It's a real bright spot in our waste program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4363)|
| 1:12:48| Ours is 37% versus the national average of 11%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4368)|
| 1:12:53| That said, we can always recycle more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| We're at 9% versus the national average of 26%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| So, overall, our waste picture is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| But people are always welcome to sign up for our curbside program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| There is a little wait list right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| But we have about 50% of households with bins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4391)|
| 1:13:16| And we're ready to serve any more that want bins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4396)|
| 1:13:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4401)|
| 1:13:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4406)|
| 1:13:26| Any more questions on this agenda item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| Council Member Huguet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| That last comment gives me a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| So, if people want to have recycling, they can't just sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4414)|
| 1:13:39| There's a wait list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| Because did our contract limit us to a certain number of people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4421)|
| 1:13:45| And how much would it cost us to increase the number of people we could serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| I mean, that's not a conversation for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| That's just a philosophical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| I think we need to go ahead and approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| But it does beg the question, if we really want to get the recycling numbers up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4439)|
| 1:14:04| then how much more would it cost us to make it available to more than 50% of our citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4444)|
| 1:14:11| It's available to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| The wait list right now is actually due to COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4453)|
| 1:14:17| Our cart supplier is having a supply chain issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| So, usually, when people request a cart, we deliver it between 4 and 12 weeks after they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4461)|
| 1:14:29| request it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| And that's just for efficiency, kind of batch delivering and batch routing and getting them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4470)|
| 1:14:36| you know, as a group on board at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| But it's not a long wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| And we have the resources to provide that for anyone who requests it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| So, if anybody in the city wanted to do it, if they could do it, it just might take them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4485)|
| 1:14:50| a little while to get the cart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4492)|
| 1:14:52| And I should say that we do, of course, only provide those services and trash services to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4492)|
| 1:14:59| you know, parcels that have four or fewer units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4499)|
| 1:15:03| So, we don't provide them to, say, large apartment buildings because those are commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4503)|
| 1:15:08| entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4508)|
| 1:15:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4513)|
| 1:15:14| Council members, I just want to just mention, you know, I had the third meeting of the Mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4514)|
| 1:15:20| Climate Council today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| And our next meeting, the topic is going to be on waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| And they're public meetings, and you're all invited to attend if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| But we can, obviously, the Director of Sustainability, Brian Blackman, you know, can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4529)|
| 1:15:34| share with you any summary of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| Obviously, Patience Malnick can continue to provide information at this meeting and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4535)|
| 1:15:41| between meetings, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4541)|
| 1:15:42| But that might be a good opportunity, something if you have a keen particular interest in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4542)|
| 1:15:47| this topic of waste and recycling and sustainability, the next Climate Council meeting might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4547)|
| 1:15:53| be a good opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| Council Member Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| Did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| Just quickly, we had a previous discussion about downtown trash collection and was wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4559)|
| 1:16:07| if that was a continued service under this contract or if conversations have gone elsewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4567)|
| 1:16:13| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4573)|
| 1:16:13| Wondering an update on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| Yes, downtown trash is not changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| The City of Knoxville and our employees have always handled downtown trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| And it's really simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| Whenever we did bid that out, it's really difficult for other contractors to even do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4585)|
| 1:16:31| it cheaply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4591)|
| 1:16:32| We provide that service seven days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| And our staff will continue to provide that service for within the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4595)|
| 1:16:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4601)|
| 1:16:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=4605)|

| 1:24:41| review process for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5081)|

| 1:24:49| both at the state level and at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| the city engineering level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5093)|

| 1:25:41| Could you address that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5141)|

| 1:25:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| And those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| typically kick in when you are looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| at industrial mixed use, but industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| general, those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| do not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| There are some minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| interior side setbacks that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| are greater when you're adjacent to residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5169)|
| 1:26:11| If you are, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| an industrial general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5173)|

| 1:26:17| it's 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| If it's not, it's only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| So there are some additional buffering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| requirements in terms of distance that it can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| be from the property line that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5187)|

| 1:26:43| This entire intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| I can't comment that everything was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| The zoning that it was given was commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5209)|

| 1:26:53| to probably what it historically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| Way, way back when the neighborhoods were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| originally built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| Unfortunately, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5221)|

| 1:27:07| when they purchased it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| It doesn't have anything built on it, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| to my knowledge, they haven't applied to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| build anything here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| The only thing that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| available is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| tractor trailers there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| is all the parcels being used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| It's certainly not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| necessarily what we want at the edge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| of our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| an entrance next to people's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5251)|

| 1:27:35| greenway, but it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| what they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| And this is an example of where whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| areas, including some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| commercial areas, were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| zoned as industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| The only area that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| near the railroads, plain and simple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| everything was rezoned as industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| And so we had a lot of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| and struggle with this during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| recode, because people bought it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| as industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| They invested on it as industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| even though it should have never really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| been industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| It just was industrial, because in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| 60s, that's the development pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| And so if she wants to comment on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| that more, she can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| We've had a few of these, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| that's why it was near a railroad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| track is why it got zoned to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| industrial in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5303)|

| 1:28:43| of these, even though we made a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| commitment to review these requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5325)|

| 1:28:51| out, but these are all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| individually looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| They're looked at on a case-by-case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| basis and evaluated individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5337)|

| 1:29:01| you get to go back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200908?start=5341)|
