| 2:35:42| and Knox County is considered a regional health department on their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9342)|
| 2:35:46| But if they do, if they, the state, does the distribution as they have been doing the funding also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9346)|
| 2:35:53| it will be by population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9353)|
| 2:35:56| So we will get our fair share based on our population of the amount that Nashville gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9356)|
| 2:36:03| I saw where 10 UT students were diagnosed with having H1N1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9363)|
| 2:36:07| What is the prediction for the Center for Disease Control as to what kind of flu?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9367)|
| 2:36:14| And I don't want to scare people, but I'm just wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9374)|
| 2:36:16| what are they predicting for this flu season for the swine flu?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9376)|
| 2:36:20| You know, I don't know that I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9380)|
| 2:36:23| Certainly there is a lot of concern about the number of cases this early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9383)|
| 2:36:30| I'm not sure that the students were confirmed H1N1, and most of the testing is not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9390)|
| 2:36:37| the testing is unnecessary and it's not being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9397)|
| 2:36:41| But the belief is that that is the H1N1 virus that's in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9401)|
| 2:36:47| You know, the recommendations are to treat this flu pretty much like the seasonal flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9407)|
| 2:36:55| And Dr. Briggs, I hope you'll help me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9415)|
| 2:36:58| I know you're on top of all this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9418)|
| 2:37:00| But that is the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9420)|
| 2:37:02| But it is quite concerning that we have this much flu in our community already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9422)|
| 2:37:07| I mean, it's a big concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9427)|
| 2:37:10| I don't have a whole lot to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9430)|
| 2:37:12| Usually the peak of the flu season, it can vary, is in the winter when people are more confined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9432)|
| 2:37:17| and that's the vector of transmission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9437)|
| 2:37:19| It's generally person to person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9439)|
| 2:37:21| I'm not aware of any predictions that the CDC makes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9441)|
| 2:37:25| You know, the vaccine, even for the seasonal flu, every year is a guess as to which, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9445)|
| 2:37:32| which they call it the antigens you put in the vaccine to evoke the response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9452)|
| 2:37:37| Last year they didn't make a very good guess, but that was most of the time they're pretty effective at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9457)|
| 2:37:42| But that's really all I've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9462)|
| 2:37:46| Everything right now is a guess as to what it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9466)|
| 2:37:49| I think it's probably important to note that the people that seem to have been affected the worst by the H1N1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9469)|
| 2:37:58| or swine flu virus are younger people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9478)|
| 2:38:00| You think that the older people are at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9480)|
| 2:38:02| And it appears to be an immunologic reaction that occurs in the lungs of those people that have caused the fatalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9482)|
| 2:38:09| So in this particular case, there may be some advantages to being old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9489)|
| 2:38:13| and not having such a good immune system because it's been the people in their 20s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9493)|
| 2:38:18| that have seemed to have had the highest fatalities from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9498)|
| 2:38:25| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9505)|
| 2:38:27| Yeah, actually they're saying now there's 50 students at UT campus with flu-like symptoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9507)|
| 2:38:33| But as we all know, we don't know that that's particularly the H1N1 because they send it off to CDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9513)|
| 2:38:39| and it takes several days to get those results back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9519)|
| 2:38:42| But, Mark, will you reemphasize because it has been in the past that if you took a flu shot, as they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9522)|
| 2:38:49| earlier in the year that you would have to get a booster shot later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9529)|
| 2:38:52| And I know some doctors believe that and some don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9532)|
| 2:38:56| But as they've gotten better through the years with these vaccines, this one today that we had the opportunity to take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9536)|
| 2:39:04| I understand is not, we're not going to have to do a booster shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9544)|
| 2:39:09| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9549)|
| 2:39:11| Based on listening at home and the older population and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9551)|
| 2:39:14| I'm sure they've been told the same thing with taking a booster depending on when you take the original shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9554)|
| 2:39:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9561)|
| 2:39:22| I think we better distinguish between the H1N1 and the seasonal flu vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9562)|
| 2:39:29| The belief is, and Dr. Briggs, you can help here, too, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9569)|
| 2:39:33| the belief is that the seasonal flu one shot now will, you'll have immunity throughout the flu season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9573)|
| 2:39:41| With the H1N1, there is a belief that there may have to be a booster shot with that 21 to 28 days afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9581)|
| 2:39:50| So there may be some confusion there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9590)|
| 2:39:53| But as Dr. Briggs said, the biggest message I think that we need to get out is the importance of getting the seasonal flu shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9593)|
| 2:40:02| And, again, there's going to be plenty of vaccine available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9602)|
| 2:40:07| And we would really, from the public health perspective, really encourage everyone to get this shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9607)|
| 2:40:16| Mr. Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9616)|
| 2:40:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9617)|
| 2:40:18| Thank you, Mark, for the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9618)|
| 2:40:20| This has, I think, been exhaustive and very thorough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9620)|
| 2:40:24| I do hope that as we face especially the H1N1, apparently that's going to be not generally available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9624)|
| 2:40:34| And I hope that we, this commission, as a body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9634)|
| 2:40:37| will try to ensure as best we can that those in the endangered population, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9637)|
| 2:40:43| get the shot first before others like us that probably are going to be not in that population for a change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9643)|
| 2:40:51| as Dr. Briggs indicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9651)|
| 2:40:53| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9653)|
| 2:40:54| We hope, again, if the delivery, there's still an expected delivery of 195 million doses in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9654)|
| 2:41:03| The country has never given over 100 million flu shots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9663)|
| 2:41:08| So in any year ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9668)|
| 2:41:10| So there should be plenty of H1N1 vaccine available if the projections hold still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9670)|
| 2:41:18| It just won't all come in at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9678)|
| 2:41:20| So everyone in this country should be, that wants to get one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9680)|
| 2:41:24| everyone in this county that wants to get a vaccine, to be vaccinated for H1N1 should be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9684)|
| 2:41:30| Maybe not at the beginning, but certainly before the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9690)|
| 2:41:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9694)|
| 2:41:38| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9698)|
| 2:41:41| Mark, you rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9701)|
| 2:41:43| Have you been able to find out anything about a hand washing protocol at the schools for this fall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9703)|
| 2:41:50| I can tell you, and I know you and I have had this discussion and there's been a lot of comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9710)|
| 2:41:57| a lot of questions, there's some questions from the media about the hand washing sinks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9717)|
| 2:42:01| in the schools that don't have hot water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9721)|
| 2:42:03| Dr. McIntyre and I have had the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9723)|
| 2:42:05| He's committed to putting hot water at the hand sinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9725)|
| 2:42:11| It's just going to take a little bit, it's going to take several years because of the expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9731)|
| 2:42:16| But there are, I think, 21 schools that's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9736)|
| 2:42:20| I can tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9740)|
| 2:42:21| We have constantly had the discussion about hand washing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9741)|
| 2:42:25| and having the hand sanitizers available for all school, for all of our school students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9745)|
| 2:42:31| And we're going to stay on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9751)|
| 2:42:33| It's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9753)|
| 2:42:34| Do you think it would be economically feasible to put one of those automatic dispensers on the wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9754)|
| 2:42:40| next to every classroom door like they have in the hospitals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9760)|
| 2:42:44| I know back in the spring when we first had this novel virus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9764)|
| 2:42:50| the school did go out and they did purchase some of the sanitizers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9770)|
| 2:42:55| I don't have all the details, but I know that they were going to make it available to all the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9775)|
| 2:43:00| A lot of those have them right now, the ones I've been in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9780)|
| 2:43:03| They've got them in each classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9783)|
| 2:43:05| And before the kids go to lunch, okay, kids, line up, get a squirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9785)|
| 2:43:10| Our school health inspector, I can promise you that is one of her highest priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9790)|
| 2:43:17| And that's to make sure that the students are able to either wash their hands or sanitize their hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9797)|
| 2:43:23| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9803)|
| 2:43:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9804)|
| 2:43:27| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9807)|
| 2:43:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9808)|
| 2:43:29| I would just add that the University of Tennessee is proceeding apace on this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9809)|
| 2:43:35| Provost put out a note to all faculty and staff this very day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9815)|
| 2:43:40| And a vaccination for the seasonal flu is going to occur at UT September 16th, 11 a.m. to 4.30 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9820)|
| 2:43:48| cost of $20 for those in the university community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9828)|
| 2:43:52| And details on the H1N1 from them is forthcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9832)|
| 2:43:56| But they also are quite aware, and the health folks there are acting as proactively as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9836)|
| 2:44:04| And we've been in contact with Jim Broyles over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9844)|
| 2:44:07| And that certainly about Dr. Buchanan has talked to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9847)|
| 2:44:12| She talked to them last week a couple different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9852)|
| 2:44:16| We've also met with the school, public school, also on the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9856)|
| 2:44:26| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9866)|
| 2:44:28| Thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9868)|
| 2:44:29| May I make one more comment, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9869)|
| 2:44:33| It's a comment for people as we get into the flu season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9873)|
| 2:44:36| particularly if you have not taken the shot either for the seasonal flu or for the H1N1 virus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9876)|
| 2:44:45| is that the Tamiflu, which is a prescription drug, is sensitive, we believe, against both of those flus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9885)|
| 2:44:51| So if you do develop the flu and start to develop flu symptoms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9891)|
| 2:44:55| and immediately can get a prescription for the Tamiflu, it appears to be, from what we know now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9895)|
| 2:45:01| it appears to be susceptible to the Tamiflu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9901)|
| 2:45:05| And so if you haven't had the vaccination, if you start to get sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9905)|
| 2:45:08| is that it will really attenuate your symptoms significantly with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9908)|
| 2:45:14| So people who may get sick before the vaccine for the swine flu is completely available, that is an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9914)|
| 2:45:22| And it's widely available, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9922)|
| 2:45:24| And it's widely available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9924)|
| 2:45:25| You can call your doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9925)|
| 2:45:27| You've got to get to your doctor quickly and start treating it early for it to be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9927)|
| 2:45:30| Mr. Chairman, can we take a ten-minute break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9930)|
| 2:45:34| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9934)|
| 2:45:37| Ten-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9937)|
| 2:45:48| While we were on break, Dr. McIntyre has given us the information that I think you wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9948)|
| 2:45:55| So I'm going to pass a copy out to each commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9955)|
| 2:46:01| There's some tea back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9961)|
| 2:46:13| Brad Mays still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9973)|
| 2:46:16| Right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9976)|
| 2:46:17| Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9977)|
| 2:46:19| Brad, were you wanting to talk when 401 comes up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9979)|
| 2:46:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9985)|
| 2:46:26| Are the WIMs here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9986)|
| 2:46:27| I think you want to talk when the districting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9987)|
| 2:46:33| The WIMs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9993)|
| 2:46:36| WIMs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9996)|
| 2:46:37| WIMs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9997)|
| 2:46:38| W-E-M.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9998)|
| 2:46:39| Do you see them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9999)|
| 2:46:42| I think they wanted to talk on when the districting comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10002)|
| 2:46:45| We'll go to 802 on page 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10005)|
| 2:46:51| This is a resolution adopting a certified tax rate for the Forks of the River Industrial Park Fire District for fiscal year 2009| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10011)|
| 2:46:58| through 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10018)|
| 2:47:06| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10026)|
| 2:47:09| No recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10029)|
| 2:47:13| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10033)|
| 2:47:16| Where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10036)|
| 2:47:17| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10037)|
| 2:47:18| I think I'm 8-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10038)|
| 2:47:19| No recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10039)|
| 2:47:20| Commissioner Armstrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10040)|
| 2:47:26| Mr. Chairman, I think that the parties are interested in deferring 802 and 804 for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10046)|
| 2:47:35| Do you want to make a motion to that effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10055)|
| 2:47:37| I'll make a motion to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10057)|
| 2:47:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10059)|
| 2:47:40| That's for both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10060)|
| 2:47:41| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10061)|
| 2:47:43| Yes, that's 802 and 804.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10063)|
| 2:47:46| Property moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10066)|
| 2:47:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10069)|
| 2:47:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10070)|
| 2:47:51| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10071)|
| 2:47:52| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10072)|
| 2:47:55| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10075)|
| 2:47:58| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10078)|
| 2:48:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10080)|
| 2:48:03| Lee Tramwell is here, and he has placed a packet in front of you, in front of all the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10083)|
| 2:48:12| and he was wanting to get this added to the agenda today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10092)|
| 2:48:17| And he could give us a real brief synopsis of what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10097)|
| 2:48:25| The biggest thing is it's pass-through money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10105)|
| 2:48:28| It won't cost Knox County any additional dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10108)|
| 2:48:31| So, Lee, if you could just give us a brief description of what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10111)|
| 2:48:35| and then I'll ask that it be added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10115)|
| 2:48:38| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10118)|
| 2:48:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10119)|
| 2:48:40| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10120)|
| 2:48:42| Thank you, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10122)|
| 2:48:43| Lee, do you have one more copy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10123)|
| 2:48:45| Yes, I have this one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10125)|
| 2:48:47| Well, the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10127)|
| 2:48:50| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10130)|
| 2:48:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10132)|
| 2:48:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10133)|
| 2:48:54| This is an extension on the lease for the drug court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10134)|
| 2:48:57| This lease has been in existence since 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10137)|
| 2:49:00| They're three months into this year's lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10140)|
| 2:49:03| There are minor changes that are spelled out in the lease agreement that's been there since 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10143)|
| 2:49:12| Mr. Bumgarner asked that I bring this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10152)|
| 2:49:14| He is, as you know, in a double murder trial upstairs awaiting a jury's response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10154)|
| 2:49:18| So, if I could get this added to the agenda and pass today, it would be much appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10158)|
| 2:49:24| There is no Knox County tax dollars involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10164)|
| 2:49:27| It's all pass-through money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10167)|
| 2:49:31| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10171)|
| 2:49:32| I'd like to move that we add this to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10172)|
| 2:49:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10175)|
| 2:49:36| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10176)|
| 2:49:38| Property moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10178)|
| 2:49:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10179)|
| 2:49:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10180)|
| 2:49:42| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10182)|
| 2:49:43| We'll probably have to get this at the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10183)|
| 2:49:47| I'll also give the law director at least a chance to review it real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10187)|
| 2:49:50| I think the law director has this already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10190)|
| 2:49:54| It was conveyed to me by Judge Bumgarner that you all have this and it has been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10194)|
| 2:49:59| Do you want to take this matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10199)|
| 2:50:01| We can take this matter up now if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10201)|
| 2:50:03| That's fine with me if that's the pleasure of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10203)|
| 2:50:06| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10206)|
| 2:50:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10208)|
| 2:50:10| Everyone understands what they're going to be voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10210)|
| 2:50:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10213)|
| 2:50:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10215)|
| 2:50:16| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10216)|
| 2:50:17| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10217)|
| 2:50:18| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10218)|
| 2:50:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10219)|
| 2:50:24| 908 page 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10224)|
| 2:50:29| This is a resolution approving the reorganization of the Office of Pretrial and Probation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10229)|
| 2:50:35| by transferring the personnel, duties, responsibilities, and funding of the pretrial section of said office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10235)|
| 2:50:41| from the Knox County Mayor's Office to the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10241)|
| 2:50:45| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10245)|
| 2:50:46| 801 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10246)|
| 2:50:48| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10248)|
| 2:50:49| Intergovernmental 8-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10249)|
| 2:50:51| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10251)|
| 2:50:52| I'd like to make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10252)|
| 2:50:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10254)|
| 2:50:57| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10257)|
| 2:51:00| I'm sure the sheriff is looking to take over this pre-filed version here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10260)|
| 2:51:08| I believe that he was approached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10268)|
| 2:51:11| He's doing a great job as a sheriff and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10271)|
| 2:51:14| but in this case I think the sheriff's office and the citizens are being dumped on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10274)|
| 2:51:19| Now, could anyone please explain to me how this is going to help retrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10279)|
| 2:51:27| and the citizens of Knox County with this going in under the sheriff's department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10287)|
| 2:51:32| Now, we've been up here and we've been merging things and they're more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10292)|
| 2:51:37| Now we're breaking up something that's been together ever since it's been established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10297)|
| 2:51:43| Now, you have to realize if we put this in the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10303)|
| 2:51:48| the sheriff has no control over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10308)|
| 2:51:54| The judges determine who gets out, not the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10314)|
| 2:51:59| The sheriff cannot go pick them up if they do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10319)|
| 2:52:03| The judges have to write a warrant on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10323)|
| 2:52:06| So what are we solving here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10326)|
| 2:52:08| We're creating another bureaucracy here to where it's just going to grow and grow and grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10328)|
| 2:52:14| It hadn't been too many years ago that we had one man doing this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10334)|
| 2:52:20| Now this budget's up over a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10340)|
| 2:52:25| When we split them, if we aren't careful, we're going to be putting more burden on the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10345)|
| 2:52:31| Now, it seems to me like that we're breaking every rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10351)|
| 2:52:37| that we've got to protect the people that are employed by the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10357)|
| 2:52:44| We've already determined that these people are going to work for the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10364)|
| 2:52:51| They're going in at the grade of chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10371)|
| 2:52:55| The rehires, according to merit boards, don't think this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10375)|
| 2:52:59| Former employees, those meeting reinstatement provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10379)|
| 2:53:03| who are rehired within one year of leaving employment with the department at the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10383)|
| 2:53:09| or a lower grade must be appointed to the step in range equivalent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10389)|
| 2:53:12| to what they were being paid when they left employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10392)|
| 2:53:16| The sheriff shall make all openings in the department known to employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10396)|
| 2:53:22| by posting them a minimum of seven days on bulletin boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10402)|
| 2:53:27| and by other means deemed appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10407)|
| 2:53:30| Advertisements shall include the following as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10410)|
| 2:53:33| So these jobs are really supposed to be put out for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10413)|
| 2:53:38| But this isn't being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10418)|
| 2:53:41| We're going against our whole system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10421)|
| 2:53:43| Here lately, it seems like we just vote on these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10423)|
| 2:53:46| and we don't know what we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10426)|
| 2:53:48| just like it was inappropriate for us to put the internal audits budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10428)|
| 2:53:53| in under the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10433)|
| 2:53:56| I think this is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10436)|
| 2:53:58| I think this is going to cost the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10438)|
| 2:54:02| And I don't believe that it's going to make anything any more efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10442)|
| 2:54:08| if the sheriff cannot go out and pick anyone up until they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10448)|
| 2:54:13| Now we have a problem in our justice system with pretrial and work release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10453)|
| 2:54:20| Right here is a man that went into work release the 14th of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10460)|
| 2:54:28| They're hunting him now if they haven't already found him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10468)|
| 2:54:31| This guy has a rap sheet here of about 12 pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10471)|
| 2:54:36| He committed aggravated robbery, shot one man, robbed him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10476)|
| 2:54:40| took a necklace off of him, child rape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10480)|
| 2:54:44| I mean, this doesn't have anything to do with the pretrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10484)|
| 2:54:48| I want you to understand that, Mr. Armbrough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10488)|
| 2:54:50| I'm telling you, we need a jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10490)|
| 2:54:54| Now we have blown away every 55 cents that we had in the tax thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10494)|
| 2:55:00| We're giving our property away where we had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10500)|
| 2:55:04| $38 million on pods and that jail was only going to cost $38 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10504)|
| 2:55:08| We need to keep these people in jail instead of letting them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10508)|
| 2:55:13| Now that's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10513)|
| 2:55:15| I know this is going to go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10515)|
| 2:55:17| but I cannot go against the readings that we have right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10517)|
| 2:55:22| from the merit department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10522)|
| 2:55:25| and knowing that the sheriff will have no control over pretrial or picking them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10525)|
| 2:55:32| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10532)|
| 2:55:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10534)|
| 2:55:36| I think Commissioner Pinkston is right in some of what he said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10536)|
| 2:55:39| and when he talked about our justice system is flawed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10539)|
| 2:55:42| and I completely understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10542)|
| 2:55:45| But also, it's going to take a multiple prong approach to complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10545)|
| 2:55:50| or to make it close to right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10550)|
| 2:55:51| We do need to build another jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10551)|
| 2:55:53| We need to build an intake center and a pod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10553)|
| 2:55:58| But I think the pretrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10558)|
| 2:56:03| deputies can pick up people that violate pretrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10563)|
| 2:56:07| without a warrant in the middle of the night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10567)|
| 2:56:09| if the judge writes the order correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10569)|
| 2:56:12| Now, getting the judges to correctly write the orders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10572)|
| 2:56:16| and be careful as to who they put out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10576)|
| 2:56:19| is something that they'll have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10579)|
| 2:56:26| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10586)|
| 2:56:29| But pretrial is going to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10589)|
| 2:56:32| Our society has decided that instead of building more jails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10592)|
| 2:56:36| they would rather criminals walk the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10596)|
| 2:56:39| Going back to England,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10599)|
| 2:56:43| when the first police department was ever put together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10603)|
| 2:56:47| Robert Peel had ten laws that have lived forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10607)|
| 2:56:53| And one of those laws were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10613)|
| 2:56:55| that the police department shall have the power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10615)|
| 2:56:57| deemed by the society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10617)|
| 2:57:00| Whatever the society will allow them to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10620)|
| 2:57:03| is the power that they'll have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10623)|
| 2:57:06| And currently, in our current political climate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10626)|
| 2:57:09| in our current state of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10629)|
| 2:57:13| somewhere, somehow, we've decided to let criminals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10633)|
| 2:57:16| walk the street that kill people, that rape people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10636)|
| 2:57:20| As a commission, we can do about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10640)|
| 2:57:23| But I think that we can make pretrial an effective program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10643)|
| 2:57:28| if we build a jail, move pretrial to the Sheriff's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10648)|
| 2:57:32| work with the judges, and work with the DA's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10652)|
| 2:57:35| in prosecuting and expediting prosecution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10655)|
| 2:57:39| And I'm voting for this because I think it may grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10659)|
| 2:57:43| It may grow bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10663)|
| 2:57:45| But I think we need to make it a more effective pretrial program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10665)|
| 2:57:49| And where it's at now, it will not flourish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10669)|
| 2:57:51| as a pretrial program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10671)|
| 2:57:53| So that's why I'm voting for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10673)|
| 2:57:56| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10676)|
| 2:57:59| Thanks. I agree with Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10679)|
| 2:58:02| I'm supporting this because I think it actually will end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10682)|
| 2:58:05| saving the taxpayers some money in the long run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10685)|
| 2:58:08| if the pretrial program is expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10688)|
| 2:58:11| And I hope it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10691)|
| 2:58:14| And I think that it's going to need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10694)|
| 2:58:17| The deputies can go pick people up in the middle of the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10697)|
| 2:58:20| And I think that's why another reason it's very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10700)|
| 2:58:23| for pretrial to be under the Sheriff's jurisdiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10703)|
| 2:58:26| so that they can go do that when they need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10706)|
| 2:58:29| The way it's set up now, they have to call somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10709)|
| 2:58:32| to come help them when someone violates their...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10712)|
| 2:58:35| So yeah, it is more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10715)|
| 2:58:38| And I think it will end up saving money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10718)|
| 2:58:41| Initially, I was opposed to it because I wasn't happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10721)|
| 2:58:45| piling more people onto the Sheriff's pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10725)|
| 2:58:48| But actually, I think this will...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10728)|
| 2:58:51| Don't you think, Brad, end up saving some money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10731)|
| 2:58:54| in the long run by having people out on pretrial release| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10734)|
| 2:58:57| instead of having them incarcerated during that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10737)|
| 2:59:00| If you pretrial release the correct people, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10740)|
| 2:59:03| Yes. And that's the key, is the correct people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10743)|
| 2:59:06| And what do we need to do to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10746)|
| 2:59:09| that it's the correct people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10749)|
| 2:59:13| Run for judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10753)|
| 2:59:16| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10756)|
| 2:59:19| Sheriff has no control whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10759)|
| 2:59:22| But they can go and pick them up in the middle of the night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10762)|
| 2:59:25| if the order's written correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10765)|
| 2:59:28| Yes, ma'am, they do that now when they call them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10768)|
| 2:59:31| when they write the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10771)|
| 2:59:34| So I don't see how it's going to save any money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10774)|
| 2:59:37| because they're doing it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10777)|
| 2:59:41| And so they have to call a deputy to go handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10781)|
| 2:59:44| Whereas if it's under the Sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10784)|
| 2:59:47| they are deputies and they can handle it themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10787)|
| 2:59:50| But most of these...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10790)|
| 2:59:53| Brad will tell you that most pickups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10793)|
| 2:59:56| on people like that are at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10796)|
| 2:59:59| These people won't even be working at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10799)|
| 3:00:02| There's no need for these people to be deputies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10802)|
| 3:00:05| that are over that department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10805)|
| 3:00:09| Now, what would be wrong if we had to send them over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10809)|
| 3:00:12| Of course, I'm for keeping both of them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10812)|
| 3:00:15| But if we send them over there, why are they becoming deputies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10815)|
| 3:00:18| when they won't be doing the pickup?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10818)|
| 3:00:21| Brad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10821)|
| 3:00:24| Well, if you make them deputies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10824)|
| 3:00:27| you don't need the same...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10827)|
| 3:00:30| You can have a civilian and a deputy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10830)|
| 3:00:33| and then you've got to take both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10833)|
| 3:00:37| If both of them are deputies, they have arrest powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10837)|
| 3:00:40| and instead of two deputies and one civilian going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10840)|
| 3:00:43| you can have two deputies going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10843)|
| 3:00:46| I don't think it's going to be saving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10846)|
| 3:00:49| an enormous amount of money on personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10849)|
| 3:00:52| but the program's going to grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10852)|
| 3:00:55| until society decides they want to put people in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10855)|
| 3:00:58| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10858)|
| 3:01:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10861)|
| 3:01:05| It is, as Mr. Anders said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10865)|
| 3:01:08| it's a need that we have that we grow this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10868)|
| 3:01:11| and that's where we're headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10871)|
| 3:01:14| We can't deny that there are, on recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10874)|
| 3:01:17| we had a paid consultant to do the study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10877)|
| 3:01:20| Kalmanoff, I believe was his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10880)|
| 3:01:23| He may recommend that this goes under the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10883)|
| 3:01:26| We've got eight judges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10886)|
| 3:01:29| three criminal court judges, five session judges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10889)|
| 3:01:33| that this is what we're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10893)|
| 3:01:36| I find it very hard to go against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10896)|
| 3:01:39| the weight of that kind of recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10899)|
| 3:01:42| so I'll be in favor of it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10902)|
| 3:01:45| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10905)|
| 3:01:48| You know, this is a tough one for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10908)|
| 3:01:51| because, honestly, I do not agree with this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10911)|
| 3:01:54| I do not believe that the government should be involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10914)|
| 3:01:57| in anything that private enterprise can handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10917)|
| 3:02:01| I believe that when we do, we start making mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10921)|
| 3:02:04| If these people can make bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10924)|
| 3:02:07| and go through a traditional bonding company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10927)|
| 3:02:10| then I believe that being released| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10930)|
| 3:02:13| before their trial is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10933)|
| 3:02:16| We have hundreds of years that bond has been used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10936)|
| 3:02:19| But what this is about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10939)|
| 3:02:22| it's going to do one or two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10942)|
| 3:02:25| It is going to allow people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10945)|
| 3:02:29| to get out of jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10949)|
| 3:02:32| that have no business getting out of jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10952)|
| 3:02:35| It's going to allow people to get out of jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10955)|
| 3:02:38| who can't make bond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10958)|
| 3:02:41| who the bonding company doesn't trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10961)|
| 3:02:44| to let them out on bond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10964)|
| 3:02:47| who their family will not put up money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10967)|
| 3:02:50| or property to get them out on bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10970)|
| 3:02:53| And if their family won't sign for them to get out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10973)|
| 3:02:57| then why should government step in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10977)|
| 3:03:00| and say we're going to let you out of jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10980)|
| 3:03:03| before your trial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10983)|
| 3:03:06| If the bonding companies won't do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10986)|
| 3:03:09| there's a reason why, and the reason why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10989)|
| 3:03:12| is probably because they're high risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10992)|
| 3:03:15| So I don't believe this program should exist at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10995)|
| 3:03:18| I believe that we need a jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=10998)|
| 3:03:21| I believe that we need to keep bad people locked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11001)|
| 3:03:25| Because the decision today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11005)|
| 3:03:28| is not whether we have the program or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11008)|
| 3:03:31| I believe it's a bad program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11011)|
| 3:03:34| and I believe it's a program that we should not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11014)|
| 3:03:37| But we have the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11017)|
| 3:03:40| and if we have the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11020)|
| 3:03:43| and the mayor's office wants to give it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11023)|
| 3:03:46| and if the sheriff's office wants to take it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11026)|
| 3:03:49| then I'm not going to argue with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11029)|
| 3:03:52| But I want to make it very clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11032)|
| 3:03:55| that this is a bad program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11035)|
| 3:03:58| It is government competing with private enterprise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11038)|
| 3:04:01| if we're letting people out on pretrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11041)|
| 3:04:04| that could bond out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11044)|
| 3:04:07| It is the government engaging in business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11047)|
| 3:04:10| and competing with private business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11050)|
| 3:04:13| which is never a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11053)|
| 3:04:16| This whole housing crisis that we're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11056)|
| 3:04:20| had no business buying homes at that point in their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11060)|
| 3:04:23| They probably needed to clean up their credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11063)|
| 3:04:26| before they got a housing loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11066)|
| 3:04:29| But instead the government decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11069)|
| 3:04:32| they were going to create some programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11072)|
| 3:04:35| to help folks qualify for loans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11075)|
| 3:04:38| that probably had no business getting those loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11078)|
| 3:04:41| And here we are in a financial crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11081)|
| 3:04:44| And I believe that we're going to have a crisis here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11084)|
| 3:04:48| And we're going to be unfairly competing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11088)|
| 3:04:51| against the private bonding companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11091)|
| 3:04:54| that should be getting the people out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11094)|
| 3:04:57| that should be out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11097)|
| 3:05:00| But anyway, I'm going to vote for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11100)|
| 3:05:03| and I'm going to vote for this for the simple reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11103)|
| 3:05:06| that we're not deciding whether we have this program today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11106)|
| 3:05:09| We're deciding where this program's going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11109)|
| 3:05:12| and if the mayor wants to give it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11112)|
| 3:05:16| Yes, I just want to make a couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11116)|
| 3:05:19| I don't know if this thing's going to save money or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11119)|
| 3:05:22| And I really have a lot of the same concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11122)|
| 3:05:25| that Commissioner Pinkston had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11125)|
| 3:05:28| I did want to make a couple of comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11128)|
| 3:05:31| about the jail situation, so this has come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11131)|
| 3:05:34| And I agree that we need to keep anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11134)|
| 3:05:37| that can harm society locked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11137)|
| 3:05:40| Those people should not be out under bail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11140)|
| 3:05:44| The problem is in Knox County right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11144)|
| 3:05:47| we're under a federal order that puts limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11147)|
| 3:05:50| on the number of people we can put in our prison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11150)|
| 3:05:53| And we have people who are not a danger to society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11153)|
| 3:05:56| that are not making bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11156)|
| 3:05:59| and they're not paying for their own bracelets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11159)|
| 3:06:02| that we have two ways of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11162)|
| 3:06:05| We can keep them locked up at a very high expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11165)|
| 3:06:08| to the taxpayer and risking the $5,000 a day fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11168)|
| 3:06:12| or we can find ways to let those people out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11172)|
| 3:06:15| and save the taxpayer's money when they're not a potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11175)|
| 3:06:18| to harm society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11178)|
| 3:06:21| The second issue is that it appears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11181)|
| 3:06:24| that there's 20 or 25% of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11184)|
| 3:06:27| that we have locked up out in the county jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11187)|
| 3:06:30| are people who are mentally ill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11190)|
| 3:06:33| and there's less expensive ways to treat those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11193)|
| 3:06:36| than to lock them up and expect the jailers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11196)|
| 3:06:40| We talked about having maybe a mental health crisis center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11200)|
| 3:06:43| when they pick someone up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11203)|
| 3:06:46| all they're doing is just acting crazy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11206)|
| 3:06:49| and we lock them up, they may not have any families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11209)|
| 3:06:52| so there are alternatives to the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11212)|
| 3:06:55| At some point we are going to need to have a new jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11215)|
| 3:06:58| but in the meantime and even after we get to that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11218)|
| 3:07:01| we need to find a less expensive way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11221)|
| 3:07:04| of dealing with them and keep the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11224)|
| 3:07:08| to handle them in a different way and I'll stop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11228)|
| 3:07:11| Commissioner Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11231)|
| 3:07:14| Thank you. Mike Arms, I'm glad you're at the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11234)|
| 3:07:17| because I was going to ask you to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11237)|
| 3:07:20| How many people do we have on pre-trial right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11240)|
| 3:07:23| Approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11243)|
| 3:07:26| We sent a memo to you just this past week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11246)|
| 3:07:29| that gave both of those numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11249)|
| 3:07:32| the numbers on probation and the numbers on pre-trial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11252)|
| 3:07:36| 676 last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11256)|
| 3:07:39| So that's around 676 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11259)|
| 3:07:42| 18 of those were on probation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11262)|
| 3:07:45| on ankle bracelets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11265)|
| 3:07:48| Electronic monitoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11268)|
| 3:07:51| and I think we've discussed this before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11271)|
| 3:07:54| but just for the public's understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11274)|
| 3:07:57| it started as a pilot program in the probation office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11277)|
| 3:08:00| we never had pre-trial before the electronic monitoring piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11280)|
| 3:08:04| and you've received the correspondence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11284)|
| 3:08:07| and letters from I think maybe 8 judges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11287)|
| 3:08:10| who endorsed this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11290)|
| 3:08:13| and think it's a way to relieve overcrowding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11293)|
| 3:08:16| Our probation pre-trial office and the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11296)|
| 3:08:19| is not going to question the judgment of the judges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11299)|
| 3:08:22| on who should be on this program or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11302)|
| 3:08:25| What we're saying is this program has grown to a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11305)|
| 3:08:28| that we think it needs to be under the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11308)|
| 3:08:32| It's not a civilian probation office job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11312)|
| 3:08:35| It's a sheriff's department job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11315)|
| 3:08:38| and if the sheriff wants to make these people deputies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11318)|
| 3:08:41| he can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11321)|
| 3:08:44| We're not telling the sheriff how to manage this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11324)|
| 3:08:47| once it goes to the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11327)|
| 3:08:50| but the reason I came up on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11330)|
| 3:08:53| we do have a memo, I think it's been distributed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11333)|
| 3:08:56| from the sheriff's merit council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11336)|
| 3:09:00| where the sheriff's merit council heard this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11340)|
| 3:09:03| I think June 10, 2009| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11343)|
| 3:09:06| they looked at these positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11346)|
| 3:09:09| and I'll just read the last sentence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11349)|
| 3:09:12| that this transfer is not contrary to any policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11352)|
| 3:09:15| or procedures of the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11355)|
| 3:09:18| The merit council voted unanimously to approve this action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11358)|
| 3:09:21| and approve position descriptions for these positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11361)|
| 3:09:24| So we did take this by the merit council in June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11364)|
| 3:09:28| We discussed it with the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11368)|
| 3:09:31| He agreed that this program had grown to a point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11371)|
| 3:09:34| that it was a program that should be managed by the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11374)|
| 3:09:37| How he manages that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11377)|
| 3:09:40| We're not telling the sheriff how to manage it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11380)|
| 3:09:43| We're giving him these positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11383)|
| 3:09:46| He will decide who becomes deputies, who doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11386)|
| 3:09:49| and at 3 in the morning when that bracelet does go off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11389)|
| 3:09:52| and we have had people in Todd Cook's area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11392)|
| 3:09:55| But we think the program has reached a point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11395)|
| 3:09:58| where this is a law enforcement responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11398)|
| 3:10:01| and not an administrative responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11401)|
| 3:10:04| I just want to make sure I understand on the pretrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11404)|
| 3:10:07| and how it works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11407)|
| 3:10:10| So a judge will determine who gets to be on this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11410)|
| 3:10:13| Judges make that determination, yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11413)|
| 3:10:16| And then the judges can recommend people for electronic monitoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11416)|
| 3:10:19| So we have a pretrial program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11419)|
| 3:10:23| that you want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11423)|
| 3:10:26| that we monitor where they are 24 hours a day, 7 days a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11426)|
| 3:10:29| And they wear these bracelets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11429)|
| 3:10:32| And they have a GPS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11432)|
| 3:10:35| If they're supposed to be in their home at night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11435)|
| 3:10:38| between 7 to 7 and they're not, we know it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11438)|
| 3:10:41| So if someone were to commit a crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11441)|
| 3:10:44| while they're out on pretrial or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11444)|
| 3:10:47| that's not really what the sheriff's department is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11447)|
| 3:10:51| Now can the sheriff's department have input with the judges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11451)|
| 3:10:54| about who gets to be put out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11454)|
| 3:10:57| or is it just basically the judge's decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11457)|
| 3:11:00| He says to the sheriff's department or to your office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11460)|
| 3:11:03| These people are on pretrial, take care of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11463)|
| 3:11:06| The pretrial people meet at the point of arrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11466)|
| 3:11:09| and do an evaluation on who they would recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11469)|
| 3:11:12| and who they would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11472)|
| 3:11:15| So they make recommendations to the judges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11475)|
| 3:11:19| More cases than not, the judges are saying yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11479)|
| 3:11:22| And sometimes, I'll be candid with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11482)|
| 3:11:25| There's people who have been put in this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11485)|
| 3:11:28| that we would prefer not to be in that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11488)|
| 3:11:31| But we're not questioning the judge's judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11491)|
| 3:11:34| How many bracelets do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11494)|
| 3:11:37| I've got those numbers right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11497)|
| 3:11:40| We currently have 664 persons who are in the pretrial program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11500)|
| 3:11:43| with 18 on electronic monitoring and SCRAM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11503)|
| 3:11:47| 158 on probation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11507)|
| 3:11:50| Would it be the sheriff's responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11510)|
| 3:11:53| Again, I'm trying to figure out how this works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11513)|
| 3:11:56| You have 18 electronic monitoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11516)|
| 3:11:59| so that leaves 600 plus that are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11519)|
| 3:12:02| Are these people responsible for checking in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11522)|
| 3:12:05| with these people on pretrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11525)|
| 3:12:08| to know what they're doing, where they are, etc| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11528)|
| 3:12:11| Remember, the people on pretrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11531)|
| 3:12:15| Those people are dealing with an attorney to set a court date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11535)|
| 3:12:18| And you know the issue with court dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11538)|
| 3:12:21| Sometimes court dates can be drawn out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11541)|
| 3:12:24| So that person who is on pretrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11544)|
| 3:12:27| versus being in a jail at $72 a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11547)|
| 3:12:30| is at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11550)|
| 3:12:33| Some of them are going to work every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11553)|
| 3:12:36| But the reality of it is some of them are bad characters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11556)|
| 3:12:39| And those are the ones that we feel like the sheriff should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11559)|
| 3:12:43| That's the real impetus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11563)|
| 3:12:46| behind moving this to the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11566)|
| 3:12:49| Electronic monitoring and the fact that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11569)|
| 3:12:52| is and probably will grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11572)|
| 3:12:55| And I think Commissioner Anders made a good point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11575)|
| 3:12:58| that if it doesn't grow our jails are going to be overcrowded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11578)|
| 3:13:01| And we're not here to argue today or debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11581)|
| 3:13:04| Whether we need to build a new jail or new pod| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11584)|
| 3:13:07| We're simply presenting a program that we feel like should go to the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11587)|
| 3:13:11| And budgetarily we're going to do it for less money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11591)|
| 3:13:22| Commissioner Lucco| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11602)|
| 3:13:25| Thank you Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11605)|
| 3:13:28| Mr. Law Director, I have read the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11608)|
| 3:13:31| And nowhere within the resolution does it say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11611)|
| 3:13:34| these employees are to become underneath the merit program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11614)|
| 3:13:38| The pension that the sheriff employees have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11618)|
| 3:13:41| And it's not all sheriff employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11621)|
| 3:13:44| It's those that are deputies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11624)|
| 3:13:47| When the people of Knox County, at least the way I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11627)|
| 3:13:50| They voted, they wanted the deputies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11630)|
| 3:13:53| The uniformed officers to have this pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11633)|
| 3:13:56| Not for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11636)|
| 3:13:59| For the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11639)|
| 3:14:02| Or Knox County to start expanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11642)|
| 3:14:06| And adding more and more people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11646)|
| 3:14:09| Just to add them to this plan which is very expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11649)|
| 3:14:12| Is there any reason why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11652)|
| 3:14:15| These employees when they get transferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11655)|
| 3:14:18| Should come underneath this uniformed pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11658)|
| 3:14:21| And who would make that determination if they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11661)|
| 3:14:24| Would it just simply be the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11664)|
| 3:14:27| Would it be the merit board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11667)|
| 3:14:30| How would that happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11670)|
| 3:14:34| And I may be wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11674)|
| 3:14:37| But I think this is more of an administrative type of position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11677)|
| 3:14:40| Instead of them needing to have arrest powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11680)|
| 3:14:43| I think if they're going to fall underneath the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11683)|
| 3:14:46| Then the sheriff has the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11686)|
| 3:14:49| Department to go pick them up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11689)|
| 3:14:52| When they need to be picked up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11692)|
| 3:14:55| And you don't necessarily need someone underneath the pretrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11695)|
| 3:14:58| That has to go out there and get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11698)|
| 3:15:02| Why do these folks need to come underneath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11702)|
| 3:15:05| This pension plan if they do get transferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11705)|
| 3:15:08| Because we have lots of employees in the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11708)|
| 3:15:11| That do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11711)|
| 3:15:14| Commissioner Letho, I'm not sure if they will or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11714)|
| 3:15:17| We just made sure that the sheriff's merit plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11717)|
| 3:15:20| Which is how new employees go to the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11720)|
| 3:15:23| That they have no problem with this transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11723)|
| 3:15:26| So I assume it would be up to the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11726)|
| 3:15:29| It's no different from the sheriff hiring a new employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11729)|
| 3:15:32| And making a decision whether they're going to be a deputy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11732)|
| 3:15:35| Or in an administrative role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11735)|
| 3:15:38| So I think the pension plan lays out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11738)|
| 3:15:41| Who is under this plan and who's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11741)|
| 3:15:44| So it won't be our decision, it will be the sheriff's decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11744)|
| 3:15:47| On who's going to be deputized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11747)|
| 3:15:50| And if he elects to deputize certain people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11750)|
| 3:15:53| It would be no different than going out and saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11753)|
| 3:15:57| But I think we're getting back to that issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11757)|
| 3:16:00| At what point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11760)|
| 3:16:03| Just as Commissioner Pinkston read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11763)|
| 3:16:06| That when an employee leaves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11766)|
| 3:16:09| And they've been gone for over one year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11769)|
| 3:16:12| To come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11772)|
| 3:16:15| And if they had prior years of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11775)|
| 3:16:18| I mean are we bending some rules here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11778)|
| 3:16:21| Or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11781)|
| 3:16:25| You know, I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11785)|
| 3:16:28| I don't want to put words in the sheriff's mouth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11788)|
| 3:16:31| He's not here but he has told us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11791)|
| 3:16:34| That only two of these would be deputized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11794)|
| 3:16:37| And only two then would go under the pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11797)|
| 3:16:40| But I think you're beating around the bush| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11800)|
| 3:16:43| With something we've got to address someday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11803)|
| 3:16:46| Do you ever cap this pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11806)|
| 3:16:49| Because there's no difference in the sheriff saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11809)|
| 3:16:53| And decides to hire two more deputies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11813)|
| 3:16:56| So I don't want to confuse a pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11816)|
| 3:16:59| That may be out of whack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11819)|
| 3:17:02| With the fact that we're putting a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11822)|
| 3:17:05| That we think needs to be in the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11825)|
| 3:17:08| And apparently he's made a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11828)|
| 3:17:11| That two of these should be deputized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11831)|
| 3:17:14| That's what he's told us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11834)|
| 3:17:17| I don't want to be misquoted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11837)|
| 3:17:21| The sheriff called me from Scotland, England yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11841)|
| 3:17:24| And he told me to tell everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11844)|
| 3:17:27| That he was 100% behind this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11847)|
| 3:17:30| He said if his name came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11850)|
| 3:17:33| He wanted me to tell you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11853)|
| 3:17:36| I'm not doubting the sheriff is for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11856)|
| 3:17:39| I'm just concerned that within the department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11859)|
| 3:17:42| That we're not deputizing extra employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11862)|
| 3:17:45| Just so that they can fall underneath this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11865)|
| 3:17:49| They wanted it to be for the uniformed officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11869)|
| 3:17:52| That were out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11872)|
| 3:17:55| Out on the beat, protecting them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11875)|
| 3:17:58| And I know it expands a little further than that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11878)|
| 3:18:01| I guess we're just going to have to trust the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11881)|
| 3:18:04| Because evidently, Mr. Arms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11884)|
| 3:18:07| It falls underneath the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11887)|
| 3:18:10| Gets to decide who would be deputized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11890)|
| 3:18:13| And who wouldn't and therefore would fall underneath the pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11893)|
| 3:18:17| To Wood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11897)|
| 3:18:20| What are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11900)|
| 3:18:23| Commissioner Pinkston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11903)|
| 3:18:26| Yes, Dwight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11906)|
| 3:18:35| I found something very interesting here a while ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11915)|
| 3:18:38| Commissioner Norman said that he had received a study on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11918)|
| 3:18:41| I was told that there were two studies on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11921)|
| 3:18:45| And I've asked for them twice, I know of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11925)|
| 3:18:48| And I believe three times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11928)|
| 3:18:51| And I've never gotten them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11931)|
| 3:18:54| There's one study, Commissioner, that I'm aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11934)|
| 3:18:57| And it's the Kalmanoff study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11937)|
| 3:19:00| I do have that available for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11940)|
| 3:19:03| I've asked for it twice, I know of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11943)|
| 3:19:06| And I've never gotten it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11946)|
| 3:19:09| I can give you portions of that today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11949)|
| 3:19:13| Why did I not get this when I've been asking for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11953)|
| 3:19:16| And Commissioner Norman, I don't know that he asked for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11956)|
| 3:19:19| But he's gotten it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11959)|
| 3:19:22| We delivered 19 copies to the commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11962)|
| 3:19:25| That was a long report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11965)|
| 3:19:28| We pulled out the pages that were associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11968)|
| 3:19:31| With the pretrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11971)|
| 3:19:34| Mike, could you speak on the mic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11974)|
| 3:19:37| This is a jail counter assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11977)|
| 3:19:41| Where is it being more efficient for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11981)|
| 3:19:44| That this is to save the taxpayers money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11984)|
| 3:19:47| I'm not here to argue what a concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11987)|
| 3:19:50| The study said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11990)|
| 3:19:53| Dwight and John Troyer said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11993)|
| 3:19:56| That studies said this would be more efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11996)|
| 3:19:59| They had two studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=11999)|
| 3:20:02| And I asked for them and I haven't received one yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12002)|
| 3:20:05| We were asked for a summary of the study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12005)|
| 3:20:09| And that's all we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12009)|
| 3:20:12| We have what the consultant said about pretrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12012)|
| 3:20:15| And again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12015)|
| 3:20:18| We're not here to argue efficiencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12018)|
| 3:20:21| As much as we're going to do the probation office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12021)|
| 3:20:24| For less money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12024)|
| 3:20:27| And at some point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12027)|
| 3:20:30| I think Commissioner Andrews made the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12030)|
| 3:20:33| That sometime over the next few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12033)|
| 3:20:37| Whether we build a jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12037)|
| 3:20:40| Or this electronic monitoring is going to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12040)|
| 3:20:43| One or the other is going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12043)|
| 3:20:46| But that's not what we're trying to debate today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12046)|
| 3:20:49| And I think the size of the pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12049)|
| 3:20:52| May be something worth debating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12052)|
| 3:20:55| And whether we build a jail or more pods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12055)|
| 3:20:58| Is something worth debating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12058)|
| 3:21:01| But we're trying to present a transferable program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12061)|
| 3:21:05| Last week, a month ago we had 21| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12065)|
| 3:21:08| Now we have 18| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12068)|
| 3:21:11| Our job is not to question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12071)|
| 3:21:14| The criminal background of these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12074)|
| 3:21:17| Once the judge assigns them to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12077)|
| 3:21:20| Our job is to make sure to keep the bracelet on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12080)|
| 3:21:23| And follow the rules that the judge gives us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12083)|
| 3:21:26| Commissioner Brown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12086)|
| 3:21:29| Yes, one quick question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12089)|
| 3:21:32| When the judges make this determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12092)|
| 3:21:35| Do they have access to previous records on these folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12095)|
| 3:21:38| Then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12098)|
| 3:21:41| Commissioner Pinkston had one here a while ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12101)|
| 3:21:44| That was like four pages long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12104)|
| 3:21:47| Single spaced on one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12107)|
| 3:21:50| But yet, I mean everything from rape run on down the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12110)|
| 3:21:53| But he's still out on pretrial or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12113)|
| 3:21:56| So that's scary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12116)|
| 3:22:00| Our gym system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12120)|
| 3:22:03| Which is used by the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12123)|
| 3:22:06| Has the track record of everyone going into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12126)|
| 3:22:09| So when you're arrested, that track record is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12129)|
| 3:22:12| And we assume it's accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12132)|
| 3:22:15| So the judges, police, sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12135)|
| 3:22:18| All have access to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12138)|
| 3:22:21| Information management system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12141)|
| 3:22:24| That Dick Moran maintains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12144)|
| 3:22:28| Commissioner Ivan Harmon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12148)|
| 3:22:31| We've discussed this for 20 or 30 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12151)|
| 3:22:34| I'm ready to call for a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12154)|
| 3:22:37| We just have one more light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12157)|
| 3:22:40| Can we get one more right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12160)|
| 3:22:43| Nobody has to turn a light on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12163)|
| 3:22:46| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12166)|
| 3:22:49| Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12169)|
| 3:22:52| Just real quick, I'm sitting here thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12172)|
| 3:22:56| And I'm in charge of going out and getting some of these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12176)|
| 3:22:59| I'd want to be deputy task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12179)|
| 3:23:02| It's almost in some situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12182)|
| 3:23:05| Like some domestic cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12185)|
| 3:23:08| Some of these officers may not like to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12188)|
| 3:23:11| It's not like they're going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12191)|
| 3:23:14| Come on boys, let's go on back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12194)|
| 3:23:17| There's going to be cases where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12197)|
| 3:23:20| You might want to take some other people with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12200)|
| 3:23:24| If I was in that position, I'd want to be deputized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12204)|
| 3:23:27| Well I'm just saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12207)|
| 3:23:30| He's got the whole department full of deputies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12210)|
| 3:23:33| That can go out and get these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12213)|
| 3:23:36| When they start going off the bad way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12216)|
| 3:23:39| And to think that this administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12219)|
| 3:23:42| Is going to be available 24-7, 365| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12222)|
| 3:23:45| Is ridiculous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12225)|
| 3:23:48| Now, does he need to be able to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12228)|
| 3:23:52| And be able to arrest him when he is on duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12232)|
| 3:23:55| I guess we could argue that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12235)|
| 3:23:58| Whether he needs to be the one to go and do it or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12238)|
| 3:24:01| But he could only do so much anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12241)|
| 3:24:04| I just think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12244)|
| 3:24:07| To me, it sounds like an administrative job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12247)|
| 3:24:10| I don't have a problem with it being underneath the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12250)|
| 3:24:13| But I just see that as an administrative job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12253)|
| 3:24:16| Not as a deputy's job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12256)|
| 3:24:20| If they're trying to lock him up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12260)|
| 3:24:23| Why do we need a deputy that's going to be in charge of releasing him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12263)|
| 3:24:26| So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12266)|
| 3:24:29| Or handling the program that releases him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12269)|
| 3:24:32| I just think it's an administrative job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12272)|
| 3:24:35| Not a deputy's job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12275)|
| 3:24:38| That's just my opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12278)|
| 3:24:41| Everyone ready to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12281)|
| 3:24:44| The motion is to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12284)|
| 3:24:48| All in favor say aye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12288)|
| 3:24:51| Opposed no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12291)|
| 3:24:54| How many no's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12294)|
| 3:24:57| Now that doesn't happen every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12297)|
| 3:25:00| Who knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12300)|
| 3:25:03| Harman and Pinson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12303)|
| 3:25:06| 16 ayes and 17 ayes and 2 no's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12306)|
| 3:25:09| Motion passes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12309)|

| 3:25:28| With Knoxville Excavating LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12328)|

| 3:25:42| So moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12342)|
| 3:25:46| Brad, you've got 5 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12346)|
| 3:25:49| My name is Bradley J. Mays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12349)|
| 3:25:52| I live at 1817 Plum Branch Road, Knoxville, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12352)|
| 3:25:55| 37932| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12355)|
| 3:25:58| I first mentioned concerns over these ponds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12358)|
| 3:26:01| At the Solway facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12361)|
| 3:26:04| In March of 2008 at a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12364)|
| 3:26:07| I informed this commission that those ponds were contaminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12367)|
| 3:26:10| That there was serious concerns over them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12370)|
| 3:26:14| Basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12374)|
| 3:26:17| Throughout last year I was portrayed as a liar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12377)|
| 3:26:20| Now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12380)|
| 3:26:23| What's interesting is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12383)|
| 3:26:26| I've got some of the counties on test on these ponds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12386)|
| 3:26:29| Here is one from February 21, 2008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12389)|
| 3:26:32| Which was one that was only a few days before that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12392)|
| 3:26:35| Or a few weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12395)|
| 3:26:38| If you notice the fecal coliform count is 24,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12398)|
| 3:26:42| Usually beaches and lakes get shut down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12402)|
| 3:26:45| When they hit a count of 200| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12405)|
| 3:26:48| If you also notice there is an arsenic count| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12408)|
| 3:26:51| Of 50 mg per liter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12411)|
| 3:26:54| The legal limit is 10 mg per liter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12414)|
| 3:26:57| This far exceeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12417)|
| 3:27:00| Any discharge regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12420)|
| 3:27:03| Under Section 505 of the Clean Water Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12423)|
| 3:27:06| I'm going to show you another test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12426)|
| 3:27:09| After they quit taking biosolids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12429)|
| 3:27:12| It's right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12432)|
| 3:27:15| And you can see that a county employee has wrote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12435)|
| 3:27:18| A limit to the right of that 10 parts per billion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12438)|
| 3:27:21| And to the left you'll see that the results were 26 parts per billion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12441)|
| 3:27:24| On arsenic so it's 2.5 times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12444)|
| 3:27:27| The EPA regulatory limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12447)|
| 3:27:30| And your fecal coliform count is over 5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12450)|
| 3:27:33| Now I informed this commission of concerns over this pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12453)|
| 3:27:37| And everybody made me out to be a liar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12457)|
| 3:27:40| Now here's the other problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12460)|
| 3:27:43| When I first told you about these was in March of 2008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12463)|
| 3:27:46| At the exact same time I was telling you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12466)|
| 3:27:49| About these problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12469)|
| 3:27:52| Your engineering department during that exact same month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12472)|
| 3:27:55| Spent $11,900 paying tanker trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12475)|
| 3:27:58| To haul out tanker truck semi-loads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12478)|
| 3:28:01| Of contaminated water to a water treatment facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12481)|
| 3:28:05| At the taxpayer's expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12485)|
| 3:28:08| Like I've been telling you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12488)|
| 3:28:11| This facility has been ran improperly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12491)|
| 3:28:14| You have some contamination issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12494)|
| 3:28:17| Now everybody told you I was a liar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12497)|
| 3:28:20| But who now is coming to you asking for a $125,000 pipeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12500)|
| 3:28:23| To run a mile and a half of sewage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12503)|
| 3:28:26| To transport this contaminated water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12506)|
| 3:28:29| To a water treatment facility to be treated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12509)|
| 3:28:33| I've been telling you the truth on everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12513)|
| 3:28:36| Since day one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12516)|
| 3:28:39| Now we need this pipeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12519)|
| 3:28:42| Unfortunately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12522)|
| 3:28:45| I wish we didn't have to spend $125,000 of my money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12525)|
| 3:28:48| Because this facility was ran improperly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12528)|
| 3:28:51| But now we're going to have to spend it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12531)|
| 3:28:54| And it's needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12534)|
| 3:28:57| It's going to be a lot cheaper than the alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12537)|
| 3:29:01| Or B, when the ponds were spilling into a sinkhole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12541)|
| 3:29:04| And the neighbors were never warned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12544)|
| 3:29:07| Who were on drinking water wells| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12547)|
| 3:29:10| And some of those neighbors have ran a test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12550)|
| 3:29:13| And found arsenic in their wells| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12553)|
| 3:29:16| And they were never notified to test their well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12556)|
| 3:29:19| Through countless failures of these ponds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12559)|
| 3:29:22| That are indisputably contaminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12562)|
| 3:29:25| But I've been telling you the truth all along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12565)|
| 3:29:29| There's going to be a lot more problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12569)|
| 3:29:32| That's going to come out in the next six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12572)|
| 3:29:35| But now that they're asking for this sewer pipeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12575)|
| 3:29:38| I think that's a good opportunity to point out to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12578)|
| 3:29:41| Just an example that I've been telling you all the truth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12581)|
| 3:29:44| Commissioner Carrington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12584)|
| 3:29:47| I just wanted to state for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12587)|
| 3:29:50| Brad, I've never said you were a liar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12590)|
| 3:29:53| And I just want to remind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12593)|
| 3:29:57| We're not on here March of 2008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12597)|
| 3:30:00| So I just want to let you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12600)|
| 3:30:03| I've never thought that about you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12603)|
| 3:30:06| And I do not overlook this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12606)|
| 3:30:09| Let me correct my statement a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12609)|
| 3:30:12| Commission has never called me a liar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12612)|
| 3:30:15| Whenever I've been betrayed by a liar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12615)|
| 3:30:18| It's been by particular county employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12618)|
| 3:30:21| That I'm not going to name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12621)|
| 3:30:25| But I'm just letting you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12625)|
| 3:30:28| I've been honest with you all since day one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12628)|
| 3:30:31| And given time, everything I've told you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12631)|
| 3:30:34| Commissioner Briggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12634)|
| 3:30:37| I guess we may need to address this to the engineering people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12637)|
| 3:30:40| And I think that what Brad says is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12640)|
| 3:30:43| About the contamination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12643)|
| 3:30:46| But that was also a time when they were still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12646)|
| 3:30:49| Doing composting on the solid waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12649)|
| 3:30:53| I think many of us went out there and visited the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12653)|
| 3:30:56| On the pad that they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12656)|
| 3:30:59| They were drained into those ponds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12659)|
| 3:31:02| But there was bio-waste or really fecal material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12662)|
| 3:31:05| That were being composted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12665)|
| 3:31:08| Maybe it's not supposed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12668)|
| 3:31:11| But it doesn't surprise me that there was high fecal counts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12671)|
| 3:31:14| Coliform counts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12674)|
| 3:31:17| And maybe a high arsenic count| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12677)|
| 3:31:21| And I think all they're doing out there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12681)|
| 3:31:24| Is mulching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12684)|
| 3:31:27| So I guess the question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12687)|
| 3:31:30| Why do we need a pipeline there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12690)|
| 3:31:33| I could understand it if they were still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12693)|
| 3:31:36| Undergoing composting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12696)|
| 3:31:39| These ponds were designed about 10 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12699)|
| 3:31:42| When the facility first came online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12702)|
| 3:31:45| And they were always designed as a containment pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12705)|
| 3:31:49| This is a containment pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12709)|
| 3:31:52| Initially they were not lined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12712)|
| 3:31:55| There was a failure in that pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12715)|
| 3:31:58| You came back and put a liner in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12718)|
| 3:32:01| And the reason I say that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12721)|
| 3:32:04| When they were first designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12724)|
| 3:32:07| They were designed on a 100 year storm basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12727)|
| 3:32:10| So it was felt like that volume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12730)|
| 3:32:13| Plus the fact you can incorporate this water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12733)|
| 3:32:17| So the total size had to be decreased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12737)|
| 3:32:20| Once we put the liner in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12740)|
| 3:32:23| Eliminating some of that volume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12743)|
| 3:32:26| There was also a concern about cross-contamination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12746)|
| 3:32:29| As you water these piles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12749)|
| 3:32:32| Using sprinkler systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12752)|
| 3:32:35| That can blow onto other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12755)|
| 3:32:38| That are not being treated properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12758)|
| 3:32:41| So we tried a variety of methods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12761)|
| 3:32:45| We put in aerators, put chlorine in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12765)|
| 3:32:48| To get the fecal and so forth levels down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12768)|
| 3:32:51| At the end of the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12771)|
| 3:32:54| And in meeting with TDAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12774)|
| 3:32:57| We felt like the best and most environmentally safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12777)|
| 3:33:00| Thing to do was to put in a treatment system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12780)|
| 3:33:03| Essentially a sewer line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12783)|
| 3:33:06| So these ponds could be drained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12786)|
| 3:33:09| We need to drain them down about 2.5 million gallons a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12789)|
| 3:33:12| This year we've had to go in there and pump that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12792)|
| 3:33:15| And haul it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12795)|
| 3:33:18| So it's economically infeasible to do it that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12798)|
| 3:33:21| Hence the sewer line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12801)|
| 3:33:24| In fact, knowing what we know now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12804)|
| 3:33:27| We would have designed it originally with a sewer line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12807)|
| 3:33:30| To begin with and the containment pond too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12810)|
| 3:33:33| You need both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12813)|
| 3:33:36| You need a place to gather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12816)|
| 3:33:40| Even though we are not taking in biosolids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12820)|
| 3:33:43| Even the mulching operation has some contaminants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12823)|
| 3:33:46| And we're concerned about discharging those contaminants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12826)|
| 3:33:49| So they insisted upon us putting it in the sewer line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12829)|
| 3:33:52| So really what you're saying is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12832)|
| 3:33:55| Since you've had to put the liner in the ponds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12835)|
| 3:33:58| They're smaller and they're not sufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12838)|
| 3:34:01| To contain the runoff from it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12841)|
| 3:34:04| And we have to get rid of it another way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12844)|
| 3:34:08| Plus in the original operations plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12848)|
| 3:34:11| They anticipated using the water in that pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12851)|
| 3:34:14| As part of the composting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12854)|
| 3:34:17| That turned out not to be a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12857)|
| 3:34:20| So therefore we're backed with the sewer line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12860)|
| 3:34:23| So it's really a volume issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12863)|
| 3:34:26| Bruce, I had a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12866)|
| 3:34:29| I don't know if you want to stick around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12869)|
| 3:34:32| After we pump this or pipe this water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12872)|
| 3:34:36| The cost of treatment will run roughly about $10,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12876)|
| 3:34:39| To treat 2.5 million gallons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12879)|
| 3:34:42| And that's what we're looking at right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12882)|
| 3:34:45| This is all dependent on rainfall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12885)|
| 3:34:48| The more rain we get out, the more we've got to treat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12888)|
| 3:34:51| Now, to do it any other way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12891)|
| 3:34:54| The pump and haul method to treat that same amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12894)|
| 3:34:57| Is roughly $150,000 to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12897)|
| 3:35:00| So essentially the system will pay for itself within a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12900)|
| 3:35:04| Commissioner Lutho| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12904)|
| 3:35:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12907)|
| 3:35:10| Bruce or Brad, whoever wants to answer this question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12910)|
| 3:35:13| Talk about the different contaminants that are in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12913)|
| 3:35:16| In the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12916)|
| 3:35:19| Is a sewer treatment plant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12919)|
| 3:35:22| Adequate place to treat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12922)|
| 3:35:25| These types of contaminants that would be in this water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12925)|
| 3:35:28| We've already been in discussion with West Knox Utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12928)|
| 3:35:32| And I'd just like to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12932)|
| 3:35:35| For an odd thing, I'm agreeing with Bruce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12935)|
| 3:35:38| In that this is the most economically feasible way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12938)|
| 3:35:41| To treat these ponds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12941)|
| 3:35:44| It has to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12944)|
| 3:35:47| I'll agree with him on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12947)|
| 3:35:50| And it beats paying the tanker trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12950)|
| 3:35:53| But I just wanted to come here and go on the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12953)|
| 3:35:56| To show you that there was in fact some problems with those ponds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12956)|
| 3:36:00| The alternative in the treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12960)|
| 3:36:03| West Knox should be more than adequate to treat this type of contamination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12963)|
| 3:36:06| That sewer water that hits them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12966)|
| 3:36:09| Other than the heavy metals contamination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12969)|
| 3:36:12| Well that's what I was concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12972)|
| 3:36:15| For an EPA 505 standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12975)|
| 3:36:18| If they diluted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12978)|
| 3:36:21| The highest of those tests I showed you was a 50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12981)|
| 3:36:24| If they were to dilute that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12984)|
| 3:36:27| Roughly six parts to one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12987)|
| 3:36:30| By diluting it down with a non-arsenic water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12990)|
| 3:36:33| Then it will dilute it down to an acceptable level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12993)|
| 3:36:36| So what they do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12996)|
| 3:36:39| When they accept this water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=12999)|
| 3:36:42| It goes in and it's co-mingled with other water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13002)|
| 3:36:45| And that other water dilutes down the arsenic count| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13005)|
| 3:36:48| To an acceptable level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13008)|
| 3:36:51| That will fall down below your 505 standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13011)|
| 3:36:54| The treatment plant will then dump it into somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13014)|
| 3:36:57| We've met with West Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13017)|
| 3:37:00| They're very much aware of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13020)|
| 3:37:03| And I'm concerned about after they treat it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13023)|
| 3:37:06| And they discharge into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13026)|
| 3:37:09| I don't know, where does West Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13029)|
| 3:37:12| Beaver Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13032)|
| 3:37:15| What is their end product that they're discharging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13035)|
| 3:37:18| And if this is going to possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13038)|
| 3:37:21| Contaminate Beaver Creek even more than what it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13041)|
| 3:37:24| One thing to keep in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13044)|
| 3:37:27| Based on the type of operation that is up there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13047)|
| 3:37:30| Some of these contaminants may be in the sludge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13050)|
| 3:37:33| In the bottom of the pond which can be dealt with differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13053)|
| 3:37:36| But as it stands now we're no longer taking biosolids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13056)|
| 3:37:39| So over time the ponds will become cleaner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13059)|
| 3:37:42| However they will not become clean enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13062)|
| 3:37:45| Just to discharge into a creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13065)|
| 3:37:48| That's what they've always been up there for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13068)|
| 3:37:51| So the assumption was it was going to be contaminated water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13071)|
| 3:37:54| That's not a big surprise here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13074)|
| 3:37:57| And the reason we're taking this route is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13077)|
| 3:38:00| Because of the rainfall and so forth to prevent overflows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13080)|
| 3:38:03| And we've had a couple overflows which we notified TDEC for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13083)|
| 3:38:06| We need to put this sewer line system in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13086)|
| 3:38:09| Commissioner Brown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13089)|
| 3:38:12| Yes, just one question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13092)|
| 3:38:15| One more observation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13095)|
| 3:38:18| Brad, the $11,900 for the month you showed us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13098)|
| 3:38:21| Was August of last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13101)|
| 3:38:24| The billing was on August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13104)|
| 3:38:27| Let me pull that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13107)|
| 3:38:30| March 08| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13110)|
| 3:38:33| It was for the month of March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13113)|
| 3:38:36| The bill was actually sent in on April 1, 2008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13116)|
| 3:38:39| The one thing I just wanted to point out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13119)|
| 3:38:42| Last year was probably one of the driest years we had in the last 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13122)|
| 3:38:45| So if that much is coming in on a dry year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13125)|
| 3:38:48| Then if we keep pumping this stuff out every month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13128)|
| 3:38:51| It's not going to be $11,900| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13131)|
| 3:38:54| It could be $20,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13134)|
| 3:38:57| And something else that's going to help us in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13137)|
| 3:39:00| Is previously the contractor had been taking bottom ash from Y-12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13140)|
| 3:39:03| And I guess you've seen in the news about arsenic problems with bottom ash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13143)|
| 3:39:06| The particular bottom ash that they took from Y-12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13146)|
| 3:39:09| Was extremely high in arsenic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13149)|
| 3:39:12| It had an arsenic count| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13152)|
| 3:39:15| I remember seeing one test of 196 mg per kg| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13155)|
| 3:39:18| Which is very, very high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13158)|
| 3:39:21| That arsenic laden ash has been cut off last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13161)|
| 3:39:24| Right about the time I started asking questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13164)|
| 3:39:27| But basically that ash has been cut off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13167)|
| 3:39:30| So you're still going to have some residual on the pad possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13170)|
| 3:39:33| That gets picked up by rainwater and carried into the pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13173)|
| 3:39:36| And over time that will clean itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13176)|
| 3:39:39| It just takes a long amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13179)|
| 3:39:42| For instance, some of those pond tests were as high as 50 at one point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13182)|
| 3:39:45| And they've dropped down to 26| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13185)|
| 3:39:48| So given time as the water goes through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13188)|
| 3:39:51| That will cure it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13191)|
| 3:39:54| But this is just one of those examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13194)|
| 3:39:57| And one of my concerns was taking in all this arsenic laden ash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13197)|
| 3:40:00| That now we've got arsenic in our pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13200)|
| 3:40:04| It will cure itself over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13204)|
| 3:40:07| By sending this water down to be diluted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13207)|
| 3:40:10| And further treated at a water treatment facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13210)|
| 3:40:13| It's absolutely fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13213)|
| 3:40:16| The West Knox Utility is regulated by EPA 503 standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13216)|
| 3:40:19| EPA 505 standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13219)|
| 3:40:22| They have to test that water they discharge very carefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13222)|
| 3:40:25| They have to certify it to meet certain standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13225)|
| 3:40:28| There is an EPA 503 certification statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13228)|
| 3:40:32| That must be signed on all of this material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13232)|
| 3:40:35| It will be clean when West Knox leaves there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13235)|
| 3:40:38| I know the engineer at West Knox Utility personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13238)|
| 3:40:41| This guy is a stickler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13241)|
| 3:40:44| He runs that place like a tight ship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13244)|
| 3:40:47| And just knowing some of the people at West Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13247)|
| 3:40:52| That I personally know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13252)|
| 3:40:55| I would have no concern at all at sending it to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13255)|
| 3:40:58| But it was just like the origin of some of this material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13258)|
| 3:41:01| Was my concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13261)|
| 3:41:04| We should have never took this arsenic laden ash in the first place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13264)|
| 3:41:07| It was just alarmingly high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13267)|
| 3:41:10| And that's part of the problem we're dealing with now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13270)|
| 3:41:13| Did you have something else, Bruce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13273)|
| 3:41:16| Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13276)|
| 3:41:19| Bruce, you've talked to the people at West Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13279)|
| 3:41:22| And you're real comfortable with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13282)|
| 3:41:25| Yes, I'm comfortable with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13285)|
| 3:41:28| And the engineer that did the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13288)|
| 3:41:31| Worked very closely with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13291)|
| 3:41:34| To make sure, because this is not a huge sewer line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13294)|
| 3:41:37| Worked very closely with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13297)|
| 3:41:40| The type of pump that we're going to be installing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13300)|
| 3:41:43| Cleanouts, and even coming up with a schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13303)|
| 3:41:46| When they actually want us to discharge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13306)|
| 3:41:49| Brad, while you're there, what else is going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13309)|
| 3:41:52| I'm having to do with the halls of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13312)|
| 3:41:55| Of course, you know, I guess a lot of y'all have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13315)|
| 3:41:58| I filed a lawsuit, another lawsuit this past Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13318)|
| 3:42:04| This one kind of hit close to home to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13324)|
| 3:42:07| Because it was a very humiliating situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13327)|
| 3:42:10| Last year when I went in to do mediated settlement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13330)|
| 3:42:13| I can't discuss what happened in the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13333)|
| 3:42:16| But I was a humiliated person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13336)|
| 3:42:19| Apparently, before this mediated settlement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13339)|
| 3:42:22| Some emails were circulated from a Brad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13342)|
| 3:42:25| With Plum Creek email address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13345)|
| 3:42:28| And I was blamed for these emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13348)|
| 3:42:31| And they were filthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13351)|
| 3:42:34| Stupid mother blank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13354)|
| 3:42:37| Lazy a-hole this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13357)|
| 3:42:40| I later received information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13360)|
| 3:42:43| And I think that it's accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13363)|
| 3:42:46| We'll eventually determine in court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13366)|
| 3:42:49| But I received information that Mr. Salter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13369)|
| 3:42:52| Sent these emails in my name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13372)|
| 3:42:55| I sent an open records request to Mr. Salter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13375)|
| 3:42:58| For any of these emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13378)|
| 3:43:01| He's acknowledged in a response that some of these emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13381)|

| 3:43:19| I've seen one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13399)|
| 3:43:22| It was absolutely humiliating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13402)|

| 3:43:28| To collect your funds at mediation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13408)|

| 3:43:34| To get copies of emails sent in my name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13414)|
| 3:43:37| And sue Knox County under the open records act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13417)|
| 3:43:40| I'm used to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13420)|
| 3:43:43| It comes with the territory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13423)|
| 3:43:46| I knew this when I stepped in the deep end of the pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13426)|
| 3:43:49| You know, just like last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13429)|

| 3:44:13| Watching me with binoculars for hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13453)|
| 3:44:16| Sitting down the street from my house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13456)|
| 3:44:19| Emails sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13459)|
| 3:44:22| And the department head has not done a dadgum thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13462)|
| 3:44:25| We'll see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13465)|
| 3:44:28| People wonder why I spend my money to file ouster suits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13468)|
| 3:44:31| Y'all will see when we go to court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13471)|
| 3:44:34| This is no way to treat a citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13474)|
| 3:44:37| But I appreciate you asking me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13477)|
| 3:44:40| Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13480)|
| 3:44:43| I've spent a lot of time and money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13483)|
| 3:44:46| And I don't try to cost the county money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13486)|
| 3:44:49| I try to save you all money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13489)|
| 3:44:52| Just for what I've done alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13492)|

| 3:44:58| To the better this county's off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13498)|
| 3:45:01| In your solid waste department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13501)|
| 3:45:04| We stopped the embezzlement of your hall's green waste money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13504)|
| 3:45:07| Right now you're collecting revenue sharing you never would have got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13507)|
| 3:45:10| We stopped the payment of hiring people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13510)|
| 3:45:13| To grind the contractor's mulch for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13513)|
| 3:45:16| And there's a couple of more deals for thousands and thousands of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13516)|
| 3:45:19| I've never told you all about yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13519)|

| 3:45:25| I know in the end I'll be proven right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13525)|
| 3:45:28| There's a pesky thing called facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13528)|
| 3:45:32| But I appreciate you asking me Larry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13532)|
| 3:45:35| It means a lot that I get to voice some of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13535)|
| 3:45:38| A whistleblower goes through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13538)|
| 3:45:41| And that there's absolutely no accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13541)|
| 3:45:44| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13544)|
| 3:45:47| I still go back to when Commissioner Hammond brought this up years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13547)|
| 3:45:50| And we were talking about it and I didn't think much of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13550)|
| 3:45:53| But I think every month you're gaining more and more credibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13553)|
| 3:45:56| And people are saying you do your homework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13556)|
| 3:46:00| You have nothing to gain from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13560)|
| 3:46:03| And all you're trying to do is save Knox County taxpayers money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13563)|
| 3:46:06| And I applaud you for doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13566)|
| 3:46:09| If there's any way I can help you do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13569)|
| 3:46:12| And I think several commissioners up here are seeing the light with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=13572)|
