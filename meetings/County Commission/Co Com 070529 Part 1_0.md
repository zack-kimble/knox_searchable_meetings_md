| 0:00:34| the pledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=34)|
| 0:00:38| Attention, salute, pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=38)|
| 0:00:43| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=43)|
| 0:00:50| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=50)|
| 0:00:59| You have your minutes that were sent before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=59)|
| 0:01:06| Do I hear a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=66)|
| 0:01:08| I'll make your motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=68)|
| 0:01:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=70)|
| 0:01:11| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=71)|
| 0:01:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=72)|
| 0:01:13| Mr. Law Director, if we could, we went ahead and said let's have this meeting today at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=73)|
| 0:01:19| 1.30, and a lot of things came up, and I think we just need to stay to 1 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=79)|
| 0:01:25| What do you other commissioners think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=85)|
| 0:01:27| Comment on that, Mr. Cate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=87)|

| 0:01:29| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| I believe that we need to be consistent in our meetings, so if we could just say 1 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=90)|
| 0:01:33| even if we finish early, that gives us plenty of time to get ready for the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=93)|
| 0:01:38| Whatever you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=98)|
| 0:01:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=101)|
| 0:01:43| Whatever you all want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=103)|
| 0:01:48| Sometimes we may only have one item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=108)|
| 0:01:49| U.K., do you have anything you want to contribute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=109)|
| 0:01:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=110)|
| 0:01:51| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=111)|
| 0:01:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=114)|

| 0:02:08| Anybody who is going to testify here today and any of the matters that are before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| Beer Board, please stand and raise your right hand and be sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=132)|
| 0:02:18| Each of you affirm or swear to your testimony here today that you will tell the truth, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=138)|
| 0:02:25| The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=145)|
| 0:02:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=149)|
| 0:02:32| Okay, first item, application is number five, William Barry Robinson, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=152)|
| 0:02:39| I need to recuse myself and turn over to the Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=163)|
| 0:02:44| Do we need to read this into the record, Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=164)|
| 0:02:46| Item 5A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=166)|
| 0:02:47| This is an application for Target Golf Practice and Training Facility at 5311 West Beaver Creek Drive for on-premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=167)|

| 0:02:55| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=175)|

| 0:03:03| we'll be hearing from you, but if you would give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=183)|
| 0:03:07| Barry Robertson, 5321 West Beaver Creek Drive, Powell, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=187)|
| 0:03:14| In light of the community responses to our application to have on-premise beer consumption at Target Golf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=194)|
| 0:03:22| which we did in response to a lot of our customers, we feel like that at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=202)|
| 0:03:30| as a result of the community and the responses against it, we will withdraw our application for a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=210)|
| 0:03:38| I'll make a motion for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=218)|

| 0:04:22| I've got a series of questions to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| First of all, what's your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| Michael R. Schultz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| And what's your address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| 8531 Widener Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| All right, Mr. Schultz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=275)|
| 0:04:37| Have you or any of your employees at this location been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=277)|
| 0:04:44| sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquor or of any crime involving moral turpitude within the past ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=284)|
| 0:04:51| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| Has beer been sold here before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| Yes, a previous owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| Is there an outstanding license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=300)|
| 0:05:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| When was your license surrendered, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| I'm not sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| They haven't bought beer up here, Mr. Law Director, since February of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=310)|
| 0:05:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| This is a matter that went before BZA, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=320)|

| 0:05:22| And you received a variance for the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| This is an application for on-premise consumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| Do you own the premises, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| I'm leasing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=332)|
| 0:05:33| Who do you lease it from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| Ralph Schultz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=334)|
| 0:05:44| And are you going to be operating the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| Does anyone else have an interest in your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| I have a partner, Christy Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| You don't show that on your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| Tell us about Christy Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| Who is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| Christy Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| She was a young lady that was the manager of Daniel's Bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=363)|
| 0:06:10| and she wanted to go into business for herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| Well, that's about all I know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| When you say your partners, is it 50-50, or what's your arrangement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| Well, originally it was supposed to have been 50-50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| but evidently she didn't have enough money to put anything in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=383)|
| 0:06:28| So I'm having to foot all the bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| But you're the one that's going to be operating the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| You're familiar with the beer laws of the state of Tennessee and of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| and you agree to conduct your business in conformity with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| Have you completed a server training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| Yes, I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| How about Christy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| How about her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| I believe she was a manager at Daniel's, so I think she had a five-year license or whatever it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=409)|
| 0:06:58| And you know that under our beer laws and procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| you're required to also get training for any other employees that you might have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| Health Department report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| It's pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| I have a problem until I run this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| I didn't have a chance to run a background check on Christy Allen because she wasn't on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=437)|
| 0:07:23| I didn't find anything in the gentleman's background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| But I do wish that we could run this Christy Allen and have a chance to run her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| to see if there's anything that we need to be checking on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| So your report is pending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=457)|

| 0:08:24| It's an application for Tennis Partners, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| Tennis Partners, Inc. doing business at Cedar Bluff Racket Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| 701 Racket Club Way, on premises formerly Cedar Bluff Racket Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=510)|
| 0:08:37| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| Come forward and give your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| David Price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=525)|
| 0:08:50| Law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| Mr. Price, we may be able to cut this somewhat short today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| What is the zoning for your property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| Agriculture, but we got grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=538)|
| 0:09:04| Says who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| The lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| Kim, not Kim Aylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| We've been zoned that since 1978 and fell under that grandfathering clause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=552)|
| 0:09:18| because when I came before, I guess it was Angie in the commission library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=558)|
| 0:09:24| and she informed me that we were within 500 feet of a residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| Then she spoke to the lady that she was supposed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| and we got grandfathered in from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| Bruce, can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| As best we can tell, the Racket Club isn't allowed use out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| It was evidently at the time that they initially went into business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| First of all, I was under the impression they were zoned residentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| They are zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| At the time that they went in, evidently a use on review was not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| So they are, as far as the business aspect of it, they are considered legal by our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| They're a legal business in an ag zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| but what in our code says that you can sell beer in an ag zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| It's silent on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| It doesn't say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| Which means that it's prohibited unless it is otherwise permitted elsewhere in the code, as I interpret it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=618)|
| 0:10:28| What that means to me, sir, is that you need to, first of all, be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=628)|
| 0:10:36| I don't find any exception to an ag property, even one that's gone through a use on review in our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=636)|
| 0:10:46| As far as being grandfathered in, from my information that I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=646)|
| 0:10:58| tells me that this business changed hands three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| What the law says is within 15 days of that occurrence, you have to turn in your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=663)|
| 0:11:10| And actually, on the day that you shake hands on your deal, you no longer have a valid permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=670)|
| 0:11:19| So from what I understand is you've been selling beer at this location for three years in violation of our code and of the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=679)|
| 0:11:33| Since it's been longer than six months, you wouldn't qualify for a nonconforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=693)|
| 0:11:42| Board, I just don't know that this applicant is in a position today for this board to really act on his application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=702)|
| 0:11:52| because, number one, he's not properly zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=712)|
| 0:12:00| And, number two, even if he were properly zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=720)|
| 0:12:06| you may run into an issue as far as your setback requirements because you have a school within a stone's throw of your building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=726)|
| 0:12:19| So there's some other steps that you need to go through first is what I'm telling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=739)|
| 0:12:25| That's the way that I read it, and that's the way that I have interpreted the Knox County zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=745)|
| 0:12:33| and the beer laws and Knox County Beer Board procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| Okay. What are those steps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| You will need, first and foremost, to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| So you would need to get on commission's zoning agenda, or you've got to go through the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=765)|
| 0:12:53| I guess your next step would be to go to MPC and file a rezoning application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=773)|
| 0:13:02| Okay. And if we wish to not be rezoned, then there will be no beer sales allowed then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=782)|
| 0:13:09| Then I don't see a legal way under our law that you can sell beer at your establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| Anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| Just for the record, Mr. Chairman, I, too, spoke with Kim and the codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| and she did tell them that they were grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| Tell me the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| And that may be Kim's interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| It may be Bruce's interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| It's not the legal interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| I mean, I understand where they're coming from, but I don't view the law that way at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| We are just a tennis club that sells less than 200 beers a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| Just to our members, but whatever that's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| There has to be a provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| Even with an approval through a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| there has to be a provision to allow you to sell the beer in that zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=843)|
| 0:14:09| or there has to be some other exception in the beer laws that would allow you to sell beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=849)|
| 0:14:15| at that establishment, even in an ag zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| Was that allowed three years ago prior to our?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| I don't know what your circumstance was three years ago, but looking at it today with fresh eyes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=862)|
| 0:14:30| I don't see that you qualify for a beer license at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=870)|
| 0:14:36| There's a couple more steps that I think you need to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| Would he be allowed to withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| The board may wish to defer it, whatever the board wishes to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| But he's got a couple of other steps, I believe, that he needs to go through first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| And I would start with MPC for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| You'll go before commission at next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| And you may also need to be on the Board of Zoning Appeals agenda if you're rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=904)|
| 0:15:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| If we defer this, the application that he's filed will still be good when it gets back to us, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=914)|
| 0:15:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| Can he do this in 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| I mean, I would think he would probably need more than a 30-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| Or would it be better to just withdraw it and you come back when you're ready to bring it back before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=929)|
| 0:15:36| I mean, could we do that, just withdraw it, and then he could re-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| You can, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| Without having to pay another fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| You can do that, whichever way you want to work it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| I'm sorry, Commissioner Cate, did you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| Well, either way is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| I'm just trying to keep him from having to go back through the application process and pay the fee again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| That took me a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| Mr. Chairman, could we help him anyway on saving some money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| If he goes and gets it rezoned, what's that going to do on that school down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| Is it going to approve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| The way I look at it, he hasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| It will be up to Knox County Commission ultimately whether it's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| You and I don't have a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| What would you like for us to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| First of all, let me say I live very near the Racquet Club and have for 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| These are good corporate citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| They do a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| They've given back a lot to the community through tournaments and that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| I can't recall a single incident where we've had issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| So I don't think he's trying to do anything illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| I think it's just one of those things that fell through the cracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| But what would you like for us to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| Do you want us to withdraw it or do you want us to defer it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| I think you're going to need at least 60 days at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| Then let's withdraw it then, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| I'll make a motion that we withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| And refund his money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| And refund his money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| We'll be able to refund his money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| Normally we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| Normally we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| Well, I mean, the point of that was to try to keep him from having to pay another fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| So maybe we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| I'll be happy to withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| And if someone wants to do a 60-day deferral, we can see where we are in 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| Move we defer it for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| Mr. Chairman, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| They are a private club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| Is there any way, being a private club, they could survive in that zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1054)|
| 0:17:44| I mean, if there's some legislation, I haven't seen it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| but if there's some legislation that would permit you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| Most of the times that legislation is generic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| but then it's so specific that it really applies to only one location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1074)|
| 0:18:00| And so I don't know that you fall in any of the exceptions for yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1080)|
| 0:18:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| Next item, number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| We need to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| Is that me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| Yeah, they voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| We didn't vote on deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| It passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| As far as the LLCs and corporations, let's withdraw that from the agenda for a couple months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1101)|
| 0:18:29| Next month I have arranged for the Alcoholic Beverage Commission to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1109)|
| 0:18:36| and to make a presentation to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| It is something that they have done in Shelby County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| I think it will be very beneficial to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| They are going to tell you all about the new law as it was just passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1126)|
| 0:18:59| And in addition to that, I have a member of my staff going back through our beer laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1139)|
| 0:19:09| and procedures and making sure that we are in total compliance with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1149)|
| 0:19:15| Hopefully we'll have that available in a month or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| So we may want to revamp part of our process and procedures after we've done a study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1159)|
| 0:19:29| I don't see anything really out of line with state law, but we're going to study it and make sure that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1169)|
| 0:19:35| It hasn't been amended in a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| But next month at 12 o'clock, I know there's a lunch for commission at 1130,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| but that was about the best we could do at 12 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| The ABC will be here to give you a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1186)|
| 0:19:54| Is there a motion to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| Motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| Any other items to come before the beer board at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1216)|

| 0:21:13| This month's devotional will be by Commissioner Phil Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| Commissioner Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1276)|
| 0:21:24| Commissioner Phil Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1284)|
| 0:21:38| Dear Lord, our heaven and Father,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| thank you for allowing us to be here and conduct the business that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1300)|
| 0:21:45| Let us do it in a way that you've been an example for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| And, Lord, let us live our life right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| There are so many people that are affected by so many decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| And, Lord, we ask for your wisdom and your discernment here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| Lord, we want to remember the veterans and the people that are fighting overseas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| And, Lord, we want to remember the loved ones in our life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| In your name we pray, amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| Thank you, Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| If everyone will remain standing, Commissioner Mark Harmon will lead us to the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1333)|
| 0:22:20| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1350)|
| 0:22:36| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| Okay, we're on amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| And I'd like to go ahead and, if I can get it out, add everything to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1362)|
| 0:22:48| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1368)|
| 0:22:54| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| We had a lady appear before us last month asking questions about the pension program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| and I believe Social Security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| And we had said that we would get some information on that this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| I'm wondering if that's going to be heard on our commission agenda this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1385)|
| 0:23:11| Are you talking about the FACA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| Yes, the ladies who address these concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| I guess I can address that since I'm the chairman of the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| We did discuss that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| Bill Mason and Richard Wheeler did discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| And they're going to get with the finance department to see what actually needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| So, Johnny, I'll be coming to you, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| Thank you, Mr. Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| I would like to add a resolution to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| Send to Nashville to ask the legislature to give us permission to work these prisoners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| not just the ones that volunteer to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| I've talked to the sheriff about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| And they can't even get volunteers out there even though they get two to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| And I put credit, you know, on their day's time in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| And I feel like that since we've got this overcrowding in our jails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| that the big deterrent to keep people out would be to make them work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1443)|
| 0:24:09| And I'd just like to get that added, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| We have no objections to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| Ms. Laura Cole had an issue a month ago that got added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1462)|
| 0:24:29| And I'd like to call on her to speak to the issue of stormwater in reference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| particularly to her property sometime during the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| We have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| I think we have a stormwater issue on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| Would that be an appropriate time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| First I want to ask, is Coach Holt here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| The rugby team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| I was just going to pull that if he was able to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| But if not, I'll just leave it part of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| I have a couple of things I'd like to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| I'd like to add this Christian Newman Rapid Response Reward Fund to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1507)|
| 0:25:14| And I'd also like to have some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| Is the law director in the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| Right behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| Law director, I have been monitoring some of the communications on the Internet of the hate groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1524)|
| 0:25:32| that have started targeting Knoxville as a place to protest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| And they are talking about the next time they come to Knoxville actually hanging a mannequin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1537)|
| 0:25:45| Is there any way we can put some sort of an ordinance on the agenda to stop that from being?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1545)|
| 0:25:53| I mean, I understand we've got free speech,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| but we certainly can control things like people carrying heavy mannequins and ropes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| and things like that around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| Is there any ordinance that we could pass to keep that from being legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| Today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| Well, they're coming middle of next month, so they'll be here before the next commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1570)|
| 0:26:16| So if we're going to act on this, I think today would be a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| We usually like to have a little bit of time to study the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| and make sure that whatever ordinance it is that we are basically recommending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| that we're putting before your eyes is number one constitutional and basically well thought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1590)|
| 0:26:42| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| I just learned about this last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| So I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| Well, it's 210, and I just learned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| I guess what we probably need to work on is maybe calling some sort of special call meeting before that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1611)|
| 0:27:00| And that may be the way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| You know, the only way that you could do it before mid-next month, mid-June, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| Would be to pass it as an emergency ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| So it would need to qualify as that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| I'll look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| Look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| And Sheriff Jones may already, there may already be laws on the books that prevent things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1638)|
| 0:27:24| I mean, we had a protester, you know, look like he was going after people with his sign that got arrested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1644)|
| 0:27:31| And I just hate for these folks to have heavy mannequins and ropes and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| that they could hurt someone with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| We wouldn't have any control over that, would we, John, if that's inside the corporate city limits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| Knox County would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| That's what I was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| You know, does the city have anything that deals with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1671)|
| 0:27:58| I mean, I don't know that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1678)|
| 0:28:16| Commissioner Pinkston, you still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| You done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| If we have no objections, we'll add Christian Newsome Rapid Response Fund to our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1702)|
| 0:28:32| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| I need to get Resolution 101 moved to the July meeting, if I could, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| We have no objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| We'll move 101 to July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1724)|
| 0:28:44| Chairman, I'd like to take 104 off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| We have no objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| We'll take 104 off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| Getting back to the 102, if we can move that to next month, I'd appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1733)|
| 0:29:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| Without objections, we'll move 102 to next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| Do we have any other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| I'd like to make one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| I'd like to make a motion to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| Let me explain myself first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| The administration has presented a budget on May 9th, and today is May 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| We've had 20 days to look over our budget, and I've looked over some of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| and I still have some questions, and I think we still have some issues with school funding coming from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1766)|
| 0:29:33| and some other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| I'd like to make a motion to anything to deal with the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| and the budget itself that we postpone until the June meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1778)|
| 0:29:45| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| Second by Mr. Cramer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| Would you list exactly which ones you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| I don't know which ones in here it deals with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| I guess as we go through the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| Well, 801, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| I mean, three of them are bond issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| One, the 801 is the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| 802 is the tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| 803 is the capital project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| And 4, 5, and 6 are having to do with capital bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| And I'd also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| You still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| Mr. Chairman, I think we ought to take up the budget and those other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1828)|
| 0:30:35| And after we take them up, if that's the wish of the commission to move it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1835)|
| 0:30:41| well, then we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| But I think we should bring them up and discuss it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| and then have any motion whether we're ready to act on it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| So I'm opposed to your motion to delay until such time as we've had a chance to bring it up and discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1848)|
| 0:30:57| And I think particularly the bond issues are separate from that and ought to be acted on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1857)|
| 0:31:03| Well, I'll amend my motion if the second will allow me that we go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| and approve $57 million of the bonds to go ahead because we know that has to deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| with the Sheriff's Department pension that voters in Knox County approved it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| and also dealing with the Powell Middle School renovation since the kids are out of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| I think the administration wanted to get as much done while the kids are out of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| So those two issues, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| I'm not sure you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| You're not sure I can amend it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| Well, no, I'm not sure that you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| We haven't heard whether you can separate those out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| and what's the impact of separating them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| That's what I'm not sure about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| Because one is a general obligation issue that's part of the 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| and the other one is separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| But there's a package deal there that we need to hear from bond counsel as to the impact of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| And I'm not sure what the impact is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| Mr. Powell, Director, do you think we can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| I'd like to hear from bond counsel as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| From what I understand, the $57 million bond purchase does need to take place this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1920)|
| 0:32:06| because there is a quarterly meeting of a state board that will be meeting in the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1926)|
| 0:32:16| And so it's almost imperative that that bond issue be taken up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1936)|
| 0:32:23| The other two, I'll let Mr. Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| Mr. Beeler, if you could give your name for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1947)|
| 0:32:34| Yes, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| My name is Richard Beeler with Robertson Overby Wilson and Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| We're bond counsel for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| I'd be glad to try to address any specific questions you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| The $57 million is specifically authorized as a separate issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1963)|
| 0:32:49| to fund the sheriff's pension program that, as you mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| was approved by the voters in the referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| An additional $30 million is part of funding the general capital plan, which Mr. Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1977)|
| 0:33:05| or the board of directors can speak better to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| but I'm sure that they've anticipated debt service in the budget for the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1988)|
| 0:33:16| So your debt service is part of the budget that they've submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| And I'm sure that Mr. Troyer or Mr. Warner can explain that better to you than I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2001)|
| 0:33:28| But the specifically on the you asked about the pension bonds timing, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2008)|
| 0:33:35| yeah, the state funding board, there was an amendment adopted on this bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| because it passed the general assembly that requires approval of the state funding board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2019)|
| 0:33:45| after this body approves the issuance of the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| I think the question, and I don't know if you're the right person to answer it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| I think it's in the book here, is an $87 million bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2032)|
| 0:33:58| Can we separate today $57 million to go ahead and hold the 30 until next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2038)|
| 0:34:04| Well, we didn't prepare it that way, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| The initial and the detailed resolution anticipate both issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2047)|
| 0:34:14| So, no, the initial resolution anticipates the total gross amount of $87 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2054)|
| 0:34:22| the total principal amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| So they're joined together on the same initial resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| The resolution just authorizes us to basically bond up to that amount, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2068)|
| 0:34:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| And the final sizing always takes place when you actually start actually issuing the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2075)|
| 0:34:41| As for timing, market conditions, that kind of thing, I'm sure you could ask Mr. Gibson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2081)|
| 0:34:47| or Mr. Warner or Mr. Troyer could answer those kinds of questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| But this is just, I mean, the $30 million, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| is just continuing your capital program that you already have, that you've previously adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2095)|
| 0:35:01| We have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| Commissioner Trammell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| The bond issue, the $87 million bond issue is from 57 for the deputy's pension fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| and then we're doing another $30 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| And that's for capital projects we already have in place working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| Yes, that are already part of your capital plan, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| For the five-year capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| So the $87 million in bonds that we're getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| is that $7 million that's going into the sheriff's budget to pay for the $87 million in bonds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2123)|
| 0:35:30| The $30 million is in operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| The $57 million is the operating component to pay for the $57 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| The $57 million represents the total unfunded pension liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| And that's just for the $57, the $7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| And the $30 million is a separate amount of money that will be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| And that comes out of capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| Yes, those are G.O. bonds that are used for general county purposes, your schools, libraries, roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2152)|
| 0:35:59| senior centers, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| And that's going to be for this year's capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| It doesn't cover anything in years two, three, four, and five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| Only year one, which is the upcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2168)|
| 0:36:14| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| I just want to concur with Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| I see no reason why we can't have some discussion on the budget today to merely say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| let's not discuss the budget until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| I'm sure other people may have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| I think we have people in the audience here who have come here with specific reasons to maybe ask questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| or hear this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| Whether we vote it up or down, whether we hear it today is a whole other matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| But I think that to shut off debate, I would be against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| Well, I really wasn't intending to shut off debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| What I was trying to do is I think we ought to have another workshop after we get some questions answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2199)|
| 0:36:45| We've submitted some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| And I think that's an appropriate thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| And also I would like to meet with the school board one more time before we approve a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| to make sure that the school system is in favor of this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| not knowing if the state's going to come through with additional money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| I think we've got $6 million worth of state funding in the $12 million that we're giving them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| And I think those are all valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| My point is, according to your motion, as I understood it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| we were just going to go ahead and defer everything for the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| I'm saying that we need to at least have some discussion if anyone wants to discuss today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| and have any questions today rather than passing a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| that we're just going to defer everything the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| I think we need to have some discussion during this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| Well, there's no way we can get the questions we want answered today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| There's no way to get the school board here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| Well, you said we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| I have questions that they may be able to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| And there are 18 other commissioners here who may have questions that could be answered today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| And, again, I appreciate what you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| and understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| I'm just saying if we're not going to have any discussion today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| I just don't think that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| We've got a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| We've still got some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| I'm really new at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| This is the first budget that I've ever dealt with for a municipality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| And I've just been kind of watching what the city has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| And, you know, they don't have nearly as large a legislative body as we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2282)|
| 0:38:09| And they still took several days and had a budget hearing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2289)|
| 0:38:15| And I think I would be --I mean, I understand, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2295)|
| 0:38:20| I'm speaking in favor of the chairman's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2300)|
| 0:38:26| I think we need to have some budget hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| and have some time to discuss these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| And I think we've got enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| I mean, it's a pretty thick book today to work with to where I think maybe if we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| we should put this off until next month and during the interim have the budget hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| have some discussion about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| and that that would be a more appropriate place for the discussion of the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| when we can dedicate our time just to talking about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| The only thing I'm concerned about is I'm no accountant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| but if we defer this, we can't vote on 802, the tax rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2342)|
| 0:39:08| because our budget's based on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| And if we go back into this budget and add things to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| we're going to have to have a higher tax rate or something, you know, to cover the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| I'm wrong then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| But not by much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| Well, I'd like to know how much I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| Well, now, Commissioner, if you added substantially to this budget, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| But we've got some budget amendments prepared after talking to the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| and also after the public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| So we can handle those adjustments, those amendments within this tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| But on the other hand, let's say, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| we decided to go out and build another new high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| and add many more road projects or whatever the case may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| then that would impact our tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| Well, if we don't get this money from the state and we have to give the school six more million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| would that not affect it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| The $6 million that we're getting from the state I don't think is going to be dependent on any type of tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2396)|
| 0:40:02| I think that money's coming anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| I do think there'll be additional dollars coming to the school system as a part of BEP reform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| So that $6 million I don't see going away under any circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| The other day I had the opportunity, well, in fact, I've had multiple opportunities to meet with Dr. Mullins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2412)|
| 0:40:18| and members of his team, not only his financial team, but his academic team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| And they've assured me that they're fine with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| I think they made the same statement when you were here the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| And it looks like a pretty good year for the school budget, particularly with the BEP reform coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2428)|
| 0:40:34| So what we're appropriating right now, I think, would serve them well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| If they need additional money, I think they can spend it in an area that's going to help our 53,000 kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2438)|
| 0:40:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| A couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| Back to the $57 million and the $30 million again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| The $7 million is to service the debt on the sheriff's pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| Where does the money come from to service the $30 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| Out of the general county budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| And now, one thing I want to make clear, the sheriff's budget looks higher this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| And part of that reason is because of the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| The money is in there to fund the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| So while the sheriff's budget may look skewed, there's a very good reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| The debt retirement money is in his budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| That's going to skew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| The $30 million would help us go forward with the Carter Senior Center, Powell Middle School, some road projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2481)|
| 0:41:27| And also, if you remember from the state of the community address, we are going to go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| with planning some additional school projects at New Hopewell, Adrian Burnett, in deep southwest Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2490)|
| 0:41:39| and also at Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| We've also made some commitments to look in doing a feasibility study for a skate park in the Powell community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2501)|
| 0:41:48| There were some additional dollars for some road planning projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| In fact, I want to look at that as it relates to Emory Road and its extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| And also, we're meeting Thursday with the sheriff to talk about the challenges that he has on his intake center currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2516)|
| 0:42:04| We're going to be looking next year how we want to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| So I'd like to use some of that planning money in that regard as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| So if we could split these bond issues out, and I'm not sure I got the answer to that, Richard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| The answer is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| I don't think you should approve the bond issues unless you're going to approve the budget that funds it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| Well, that was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| The other money is in the rest of the budget, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2546)|
| 0:42:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| Mr. Mullins, could you come forward and address real quick, are you comfortable with the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2556)|
| 0:42:44| I think they called your doctor a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| He is a doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| I did not know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| No, I hadn't made the doctor yet, but I appreciate it just the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| I told Mr. Thomas back there, I said, hey, listen, I think you need to upgrade my salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2583)|
| 0:43:09| I think we do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| He's done a great job since he's been in this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| You were almost right, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| Yes, as far as the commitment of the dollars that's coming to the budget right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| it makes sure that we can continue doing what we've been doing and continue doing that next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2606)|
| 0:43:32| I'm certainly looking forward to some additional dollars from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| which will allow us to do our excellence in literacy program that we're anxious to get started in the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| So, at this time right now, I feel I'll be doing okay if everything comes through as proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| Mr. Superintendent, while you're there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| talking about the budget right up here, 6.5 million, I guess, is from the Great School Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2630)|
| 0:43:57| And I think this morning we heard from the chairman of the school board saying that if the priorities are not met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2637)|
| 0:44:05| with the school system in their budget that they could use the 6.5 million set out through the Great School Partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2645)|
| 0:44:11| and what all the implementation teams have come up with about TAP and birth to kindergarten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2651)|
| 0:44:17| They could use that money elsewhere, wherever they deem fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| Are you saying you're happy with the budget for the school system the way it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| and it will fund everything that you need it to fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| It will fund our continuation budget, but it will not fund everything the board approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| The board approved $368 million, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| and certainly it won't approve everything that the current revenue that is projected will not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2677)|
| 0:44:44| But as I indicated earlier, the $344.2 million, which will take care of our continuation budget, yes, that will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2684)|
| 0:44:51| As far as the Great School Partnership is concerned, the board has to approve that budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| and it's certainly their option to look at that budget as it relates to the total school budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| and make any decision accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| Is the $344.2 million, will that cover the literacy program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| That was something I think they believe very strongly in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| and so that money could come out of the Great School Partnership money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| out of either TAPs or birth to kindergarten to fund the literacy program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2716)|
| 0:45:22| If we don't fund it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2722)|
| 0:45:23| Commissioner, yes, if the board so chooses to do that, they could, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| Back to the $30 million, may you please bear with me, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| I've got New Hopewell, Powell Middle, did you say Southwest Knox County Elementary School?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2736)|
| 0:45:41| And we've got to do, again, the school board is saying another rezoning for middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2741)|
| 0:45:47| Should we not wait before we start planning these schools to make sure we do put them where we need them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2747)|
| 0:45:55| Well, when you look at three of the four, Commissioner, the replacement facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| regardless Carter Elementary needs a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| And basically what this money will do, it will allow us to size it, to get started on design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| so next year we can have a budget that's real, not a budget that's a gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| We need to work with the board on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| The same is true of Adrian Burnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| It needs a new facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| The New Hopewell has been looking for a new, it was built as a temporary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| They already have land that's adjacent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| It may have to be built in phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| But those three schools are replacement facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| and they need to be designed that way and size determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| The Southwest Elementary School has been brought to our attention by the board in terms of overcrowding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2789)|
| 0:46:36| in that part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| We've visited with the superintendent and his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| We've got some options there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| But what I'd like to do next year is to present you with what it's going to cost to actually build these schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| what size they're going to be, and at least have part of the planning and design work done on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| Same thing with the other projects that I mentioned as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| What I'm very reluctant to do is just say, okay, here's Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| We don't know how much it's going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| And then we get into, in the past we've had some troubles with busting budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| I don't want to do that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| So that's why that money is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| But it seems like we've got $30 million and we're not having a tax increase, and that's just wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2825)|
| 0:47:11| But how do we pay for $30 million without a tax increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2831)|
| 0:47:15| We've not had that much revenue growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| Well, you pay for it in, we have had good revenue growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| We pay for it in bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| We're spending a little bit of our debt, or rather not our debt, our fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| But in working with the bond people, we've accumulated an additional fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| We're spending it in that kind of a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| I think it's a very physically sound budget without a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| And I think that's why our citizens really want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| And it just looks like it's pay me now or pay me later kind of deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| I mean, I think we're going to get into, you know, a couple of years down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| where we're going to have another $0.55 tax increase or something, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| That is, without a question, not my intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| And we've worked very, very hard to grow the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| We're going to continue to do that, and we're going to push diligently in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| Also, if you recall, our percentage of money contributed to schools has continued to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| The state's has contributed to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| I want school funding from the state to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| It looks like we have that opportunity thanks to a lot of people, including this body working with us on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| and the General Assembly and the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| I think right now we're in good shape, or I wouldn't propose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| We're not going to leave a budget that's physically irresponsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| or we're not going to put a budget in place that's going to cripple future generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| That's why I was absolutely committed to funding the $57 million on the pension plan this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| That way it gets us even going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| The fund balance you mentioned, how much money are we using out of our funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| That's like our savings account, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| So we're using how much money out of our fund balance this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| And that is going into operating our budget, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| When you're talking about general fund balance, what we're going to be using is $3 million out of this year's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| end-of-the-year funds are going to be rolled forward into the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| For the lack of a better term, it parks for one day in the fund balance and then gets moved back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| The other $3 million is from the money that we accumulated in the previous year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| which we had anticipated to draw down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| And we're going to implement it in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2949)|
| 0:49:15| These are some questions that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| And that's why I seconded Chairman Moore's motion to put this off for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| And there's more questions like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| And, you know, I'm one of 13 that's never voted on a budget like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| And I think we need to understand what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| And, you know, dialogue like this certainly helps you understand what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2971)|
| 0:49:37| $600 million budget, it takes more than 20 days for me to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2977)|
| 0:49:44| And I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| And it's nothing against what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| It's just, you know, I think we need to slow down and take our time and make sure we know what we're voting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2987)|
| 0:49:53| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| Hey, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| I want to make sure I understand this school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| The $344.2 and then I had read where there was $5 million in textbooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| Now, is that in addition to the $344.2 or is that part of the $5 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| Is that $5 million part of the $344.2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3007)|
| 0:50:14| There has been an amendment in their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| And what they're going to do is take the funds in this year's budget to buy the textbooks in this period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3015)|
| 0:50:21| Otherwise, they would have rolled that money forward into the next budget, which is to buy the textbooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| Such is not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| So the $344.2 will not include the textbooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| That will be bought in this year's funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| Yes, sir, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| The $6 million round figure on the Great Schools Partnership, that money has to be approved by the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3032)|
| 0:50:39| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| So if they wanted to do a literacy program, they could talk with the Great Schools Partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3040)|
| 0:50:45| and have it funded through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| So that's nothing that we would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| We would have fund the money for the partnership program, but then the school board works with the partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| as I understand it, and they approve it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| And I'm very hopeful that we end up doing both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| But I think that that's going to work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| So when you add the six and a half to that, you're really looking at around $350 total dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3064)|
| 0:51:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| And also what we've made a commitment to working with the board a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| If you'll recall in the past, the board paid their own debt on projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3078)|
| 0:51:23| In other words, if they built a new school, they had to pay the debt service on it out of their own budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3083)|
| 0:51:29| Going forward, a couple of years ago, we've been picking up the majority of that in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3089)|
| 0:51:34| So that frees up more of their budget for operating expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| and that was done at the request of two board chairs, initially Chairman Anderson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| and followed by that Chairman Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| And I don't want to speak for Chairman Carson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| but she hasn't given me any other indication that that's not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3113)|
| 0:52:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3121)|
| 0:52:02| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| I don't know if Mike or John, if you want to answer this, get into our tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3127)|
| 0:52:14| Our tax rate is made up of basically three components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| We've got $1.24 going towards our general operation budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| We've got $0.22 going towards debt and $1.23 going towards the general schools, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3143)|
| 0:52:33| I believe we've got the $0.22, if I'm right, I believe that equates to about 17 point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3153)|
| 0:52:44| million dollars towards our $60 million of debt that we're going to have this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3164)|
| 0:52:51| I'm sorry, the 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| Say the question one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3173)|
| 0:52:54| $0.22 on our tax rate brings in a little over $17 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| Yes, that's about right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| I guess which means the remainder of the $60 plus million must come out of the general operating fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3184)|
| 0:53:11| Is that not right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| For our operation, I mean, for our debt service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3193)|
| 0:53:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| I mean, we've got a $60 million bond payment, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3198)|
| 0:53:23| We're going to have to pay that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| And we only have within our property tax rate, we only have $17 million of that being paid by property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3206)|
| 0:53:34| The next big chunk of that $60 million that pays for the overall debt service comes from the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3214)|
| 0:53:40| and an operating transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| That's going to be about $18.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| And then they're also going to put in another $4.8 million out of their operating budget to meet their school debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3226)|
| 0:53:55| Well, I think we need to move some of the money out of the general operating to better reflect our true statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3235)|
| 0:54:05| of what our debt is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| I think we need to move some of that money out of that $1.24 towards that $0.22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3249)|
| 0:54:19| And one of the reasons for that, as we found out, is that when we do a TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| and we're giving money, tax dollar money, away to help out a private individual do a project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3264)|
| 0:54:34| we're not allowed to give that money away by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3274)|
| 0:54:40| We must keep that money that's generated by the $0.22 or the debt service amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3280)|
| 0:54:49| whereas the rest of the tax rate can go towards the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3289)|
| 0:54:55| And I think we need to move some of that out of here because we still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| if it's within our $0.22 of going towards debt or if it's moving 40s, making it 46, making it an even dollar for general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3301)|
| 0:55:14| then when we do do a TIF and if this body feels that it's a good idea to do a TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3314)|
| 0:55:20| then the money that the taxpayers are paying towards debt will remain with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3320)|
| 0:55:28| I think that is a very good point, and we're working on some of the math right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| We should have it in a couple of minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3332)|
| 0:55:33| But we appreciate you bringing it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3333)|
| 0:55:34| I think you're on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| And if you could figure out, you know, what that should be, you know, just looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3335)|
| 0:55:42| if we go down to the dollar for the general, which means the $0.24,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| I think that comes up a little bit to, I don't know, somewhere between $18 million and $19 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3346)|
| 0:55:52| which would take us somewhere to about $36 million total coming out of property tax going towards our debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3352)|
| 0:56:02| And I think that would be a little more reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| But if you can come up with something, I'd appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3364)|
| 0:56:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| Commissioner Boatles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| I just want to reiterate something here, and I want to make it very clarified just to make sure on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3375)|
| 0:56:21| We're talking $344.2 on the school budget plus $6 million on great schools partnership, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3381)|
| 0:56:27| That is without any, that's without one single cent of cigarette tax, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3387)|
| 0:56:33| Cigarette tax comes in at 20 cents, for example, we would adjust the figure upward, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3393)|
| 0:56:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| Or if they spend surplus revenues, we adjust the figure upward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3403)|
| 0:56:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| Let me see if I can get in my mind the BEP, the potential BEP money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3420)|
| 0:57:05| Obviously the low-end zero, we could get none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3425)|
| 0:57:10| I'm hearing from different places it could be as much as $12 million this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| And even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| What's the upper end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| I think if you're, I think we're probably looking at something between 10 and 12 this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3440)|
| 0:57:26| So, and then if I'm not mistaken, not that we would want to, but we can never fund the schools less than we did the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3446)|
| 0:57:33| previous year, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| One more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| What we have on before us right now is to defer this until June, but also have some public hearing workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3461)|
| 0:57:48| And I would suggest meeting with the school administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| and the school board prior to our next meeting to make sure everybody is okay with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3471)|
| 0:57:58| Also, I think by then the legislature will be out of session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| We'll know what the state's going to do for us as far as BEP coming to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3481)|
| 0:58:07| So, I think, as you've seen, we've spent about 40 minutes talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| And I don't think this was the end of the discussion if we had to vote on it right this minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| Mr. Chairman, would this take 13 or 10 votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3495)|
| 0:58:20| Ten votes because we're going to defer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| It's not a change to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| Right, just ten votes, isn't it, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3503)|
| 0:58:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| Mr. Mullins, could you come back to the podium real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3511)|
| 0:58:41| When you had us as individual commissioners come before the school, your people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| administration and Mr. Thomas and whatnot, have you all made any changes since then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| Because you gave us open invitation at that time to where we met with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| Has anything changed since then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| We've made no changes since those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| Mr. Chairman, a clarification on your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| Do you intend, is it to defer items 801, 802 and 803?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| And does it also intend to defer items 804, 805 and 806?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3548)|
| 0:59:14| It is to defer anything that has to do with next year's budget, including the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| So that would include all six items I just mentioned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| Without looking at it, I would say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| So that would include the 57 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| Well, I think that's something we need to ask the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| We can divide the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| I think the resolution is just authorizing up to 87 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3571)|
| 0:59:36| I think we can say we're ready to pull the trigger on 57 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| and then we could do the renovation to Powell Middle School and say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| start getting the contracts ready because we know we're going to do those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| Well, the Powell Middle School would come out of the 30 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3594)|
| 0:59:55| Because that's part of the overall capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| So I guess you'd have to divide it to a point where how much is the Powell Middle School?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| Is it about 16?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| It's $15 million in the five-year capital plan for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3605)|
| 1:00:11| Would there be any expenditures prior to July 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| If the contractors have the way, yes, there would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| Could you go ahead and start construction today if we approve the budget that goes into effect July 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3621)|
| 1:00:26| and then go ahead and expense monies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| I can't speak on behalf of the contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| That's a business risk that he'd have to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| So we could do nothing on it, and he could go ahead and start if he chose to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3632)|
| 1:00:39| That would be his risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| I guess my question is, can we line item out the 15 million out of the 30 million within the overall capital plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3643)|
| 1:00:53| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| Is that proper to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| Well, it may not need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| I mean, if they cannot dispense the money prior to July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| Well, the only thing I've heard that we absolutely had to have was the 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| I mean, Richard, you're saying that we really need to approve the 57 million today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3664)|
| 1:01:11| Well, the entire agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| I mean, what does it do to us if we postpone the 57 million until next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3673)|
| 1:01:19| I'm not certain, Commissioner, but I think it may kick us into not having funding for the pension obligations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3679)|
| 1:01:26| until as late as December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| It depends on when the state funding board meets again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| The 87 million initial resolution that you have before you is the initial resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3692)|
| 1:01:39| for the entire amount that was brought to you as part of your ordinary capital funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3699)|
| 1:01:45| The 30 million and the 57 million follow the initial resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3705)|
| 1:01:50| So what I'm saying is, no, they can't really readily be divided out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| That's separate issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| There's one initial resolution that speaks to both the 30 and the 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| And so they're all part of the same transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| I guess my question is, is within the 30 itself, can we still divide out the 15 to do the PAL?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3724)|
| 1:02:11| I mean, is that possible to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| I mean, is it possible that we do 15 and then next month come back with another 15 to take care of everything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3734)|
| 1:02:19| Would that be proper to do it that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| I think that's a question of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| And to go back to Commissioner Moore's point, we may not receive a bill from the contractor until July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3743)|
| 1:02:30| which is when you say expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| That's what I'm thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3752)|
| 1:02:33| But as far as appropriating, you definitely need to appropriate some money today so that he knows that the work that he does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3753)|
| 1:02:39| starting, you know, as soon as possible, he'll be paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3759)|
| 1:02:48| I guess I still don't have a clear answer to my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| Can we do just the 15 million for the PAL?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3770)|
| 1:02:56| Because I think everybody here would like to see that project go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3776)|
| 1:03:01| Can that be done today and still, I mean, can that be pulled out of the 30 million today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3781)|
| 1:03:08| and then come back and do the rest of the 15 next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3788)|
| 1:03:13| I mean, would we have to adjust the capital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| You're talking about going to the market twice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3796)|
| 1:03:21| Well, are we just talking about authorization or are we talking about actual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| We're talking about authorization up to the 87.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| Well, I think we should go ahead and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| This is that I think we ought to go ahead and do the full 87 million, if that's what we're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| so that we can take care of all these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| And then maybe come back and if that's what you're trying to do, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3819)|
| 1:03:46| is defer the actual budget until next year, for next year's until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3826)|
| 1:03:53| But I think we've got our --I'm hearing from bond counsel that the 57 million really needs to be done today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3833)|
| 1:04:00| And I find it hard to pull the 15 million out to take care of a PAL project that needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3840)|
| 1:04:06| So I'm thinking maybe we should go ahead and approve those today regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| What if I amend the motion that we go ahead and authorize up to 87 million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3849)|
| 1:04:15| and we defer the rest of it until next month with having a public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3855)|
| 1:04:20| and then also a workshop or a meeting, whatever you want to call it, with the Knox County School Board to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3860)|
| 1:04:27| what the money is coming from the state because I think the legislature will be done into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3867)|
| 1:04:33| probably end of the month or sometime in the first week of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| So if that makes the commissioner, Commissioner Luthor, happy to go ahead and appropriate the 87 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| Well, I think we probably need to just go ahead and divide up the question on each of these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3882)|
| 1:04:47| and then vote on them whether we want to postpone them to next month or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| I think that might be the best way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3891)|
| 1:04:52| I'm going to ask that we divide up each of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| You want to divide on the up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| I want to divide the question on all the items that you want to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3898)|
| 1:05:03| So let's just you want to start with deferring the budget until June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3903)|
| 1:05:09| Well, I mean, that's the first one listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| So we might as well just take them in order if we want to vote on whether or not we're going to defer until next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3911)|
| 1:05:17| or I guess hear it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| That's all we're voting on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| We're not on the actual item yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3922)|
| 1:05:23| If we do that right now, vote on deferring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| If it doesn't pass, then there's no use going to the 87 million because we'll discuss it later on in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3931)|
| 1:05:32| If you vote on deferring it, you're deferring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| You need to list what your item is, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| Or you'll defer everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3939)|
| 1:05:40| We're going to defer everything except come back if it passes to defer it until June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| We will come back and vote on going ahead and approving the bond up to $87 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| Well, we still have like the tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| We still have some other items here that we need to vote either to defer or not to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3951)|
| 1:06:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3961)|
| 1:06:02| Commissioner Bolus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3965)|
| 1:06:06| I just want to make sure here there's one other person here that may want to speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| I'm not sure to that point yet on county, on employee pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| Ms. Fogerson, I believe, wanted to address this today from human resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| Yeah, we may not be that far yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| If we postpone it, we can deal with it over the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| I just want to make sure it does not get jumped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3986)|
| 1:06:27| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| I just want to make sure that I'm not in favor of saying that you felt that we needed to be responsible in the way that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| handle the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3993)|
| 1:06:34| And I just want to make sure, and I agree with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| and I want to make sure are we being responsible if we vote just on bonds today without the budget to fund it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=3996)|
| 1:06:43| And I guess maybe that's a law director question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| I mean, can you fund a bond issue without the accompanying document to fund it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4005)|
| 1:06:52| Commissioner, if I may address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| we could authorize the issuance of $500 million in debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| But until the body also authorizes the payments, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4020)|
| 1:07:06| I'm certainly not going to be issuing any opinion letters that says that they're being duly issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4026)|
| 1:07:11| So, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| The answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| You have to have appropriations to fund that debt at the same time that in hand at the same time we go to the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4034)|
| 1:07:22| And, you know, historically, I mean, Knox County has always had a very high rating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4042)|
| 1:07:29| been very well regarded in the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| And that's the kind of reason why that we've always done them, you know, consistently, conservatively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4051)|
| 1:07:38| and with the proper appropriations, not stretching our debt out too far, those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4058)|
| 1:07:44| Richard, does that mean approving the bond issue does you no good as far as the timetable goes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| It does you no good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| You won't be getting any money because nobody is going to either issue or buy the bonds until there is an accompanying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4071)|
| 1:08:01| appropriation to cover the debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| And plus, keep in mind, with the pension bonds in particular, we do have that complication of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4085)|
| 1:08:12| you're probably looking at November or December before you could even issue those bonds because we've got to get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4092)|
| 1:08:16| state funding board approval also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| And they meet how often?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| Quarterly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| Quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| And they meet in June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| Could it be September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| They're meeting, I think, in July, early July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4106)|
| 1:08:32| So it don't matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| Late June would be the last of the quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4114)|
| 1:08:35| So they must be meeting in late June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| But I don't have their schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4117)|
| 1:08:38| But I do know that they don't meet every month or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| They meet quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| So if we approve it today or next month, it really doesn't matter because you can't go to the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4124)|
| 1:08:50| until the end of next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| You're not going to the market until there is an appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| I'm saying for the $57 million piece that requires state funding board approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4135)|
| 1:09:00| we wouldn't be getting in the market for that until well after July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| because we have to have the state funding board's approval first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| And we've got to get on their agenda, have their approval, move it through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| and then put the debt issue together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| But keeping in mind, taking you back a little bit, the two pieces of the bond issue resolutions here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4154)|
| 1:09:21| we've got an initial resolution that starts the clock on this 20-day window within which citizens can file protests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4161)|
| 1:09:28| Both of those are in the initial resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| We've got a total of $87 million in aggregate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4173)|
| 1:09:34| That's just the figure of $30 million in anticipation of your capital requirements for this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| which the mayor has based his funding on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| Add to that the outstanding commitment of this body to fund the $57 million for the sheriff's pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4181)|
| 1:09:48| Those together are in the initial resolution, starts the 20-day clock running for protests before we can go to market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4188)|
| 1:09:57| So ordinarily, we would ask very shortly after the 20 days runs, we would be immediately before the state funding board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4197)|
| 1:10:04| and then would be ready to issue the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| This debt has to be funded one way or another July 1st, the pension obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4207)|
| 1:10:12| Your obligation begins July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| So if we were to approve the bond issues today, you will be on the July meeting or the June meeting of the state funding board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4215)|
| 1:10:25| Well, Commissioner, not without, you know, without a budget that funds your debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4225)|
| 1:10:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| So you've got to have the revenue, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4234)|
| 1:10:35| If we approve it next month, you will be on the September meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4235)|
| 1:10:39| Commissioner, I haven't checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| My understanding is that it's a quarterly meeting, which tells me it's probably either September or October that they're meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4241)|
| 1:10:48| You're looking at November or December to get to market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4250)|
| 1:10:51| If we miss this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| Is the state pension board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| State funding board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4256)|
| 1:10:57| State funding board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4257)|
| 1:10:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| Richard, let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4260)|
| 1:11:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| The law enforcement pension they're going to be putting over into the UOP plan is $34 million or something similar to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4263)|
| 1:11:12| Is that number correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4272)|
| 1:11:13| Somewhere in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| The employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4274)|
| 1:11:15| The officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4275)|
| 1:11:16| Well, yeah, depending on how many decide to roll over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| So is it necessary to have this in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| We're not going to have it in place July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| If someone retires, we would have money to commit obligations that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4284)|
| 1:11:30| You're going to have to fund any current demands on the system July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4290)|
| 1:11:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| It depends on how many people retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| Hopefully, the fund will have adequate balance to cover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| But nobody is going to start getting a check until when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| If they retire in July?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4305)|
| 1:11:46| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4306)|
| 1:11:47| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4307)|
| 1:11:48| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| Commissioner Kaywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4314)|
| 1:11:55| I just wanted to point out that I work for the juvenile court clerk's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4315)|
| 1:11:59| and my husband works for Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4319)|
| 1:12:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4325)|
| 1:12:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| This body promised the voters of Knox County that if they voted for the sheriff's pension system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4331)|
| 1:12:18| and the numbers they had was that basically we would have that kind of money sitting there on July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4338)|
| 1:12:26| And the only part that will be there is basically the rollover from the employee's part of the contribution system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4346)|
| 1:12:32| to that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| We're looking now that we're going to be several months down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| and all the projections amount earnings was that this money was to be invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4359)|
| 1:12:43| By definition, the money will not be there and will not be drawn any interest whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4363)|
| 1:12:48| We also have another one, and I don't know if Richard Miller can answer the question or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4368)|
| 1:12:52| In terms of the payback, we said we were going to, in this budget, put $70 million towards paying that bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4372)|
| 1:13:00| That's the estimated cost of what we thought a year's payment would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| Richard, could you answer the question that if this is not approved for several months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4385)|
| 1:13:10| even if we approve the budget today, we probably wouldn't have the money in hand until later on in the fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4390)|
| 1:13:17| Is this going to change the amount of money that we were going to be paying against that thing and delay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4397)|
| 1:13:23| And how would this affect the pension board's calculations, how much money they're going to earn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4403)|
| 1:13:28| Because obviously they won't have that 57 to invest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| You will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| You're just delaying the opportunity to invest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| And even as taxable debt, you know, you're going to have an increased cost, ultimately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4417)|
| 1:13:45| What about the cost to Knox County in paying that back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| We would only have fewer months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| Does that lower the cost and put the debt further out at the other end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4429)|
| 1:13:53| Yeah, you would put it further out, but you would still have an increased initial funding requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4433)|
| 1:13:59| Well, is that going to change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| Is that going to change the amount of that $7 million to a lower number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| Because we're really not going to be paying that bond faster than, I guess, the issue says we're going to pay it, are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4443)|
| 1:14:09| Commissioner, I would have to get the FAs to look at an amortization schedule for that to tell you, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| But, obviously, it's not going to reduce your cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| Not automatically, but it would for this fiscal year, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| You're only paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| It's like buying a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| Oh, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| If you make a bigger down payment, you're saying that, yeah, if the county came up with X dollars to fund that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4465)|
| 1:14:31| I'm not suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| Well, what it amounts to, if we took the $7 million, we could, in fact, pay ahead of the schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4472)|
| 1:14:38| So the question is, is the intent of Knox County, if we have an amortization schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4478)|
| 1:14:44| that we're supposed to pay monthly at some regular intervals, we would have fewer of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4484)|
| 1:14:49| Will we pay fewer in this fiscal year, or would we pay more against it, like in a house mortgage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4489)|
| 1:14:55| where you reduce the principal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| So maybe that's back to the executive side of government where they would intend, even if we borrow in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4497)|
| 1:15:04| that we would go ahead and pay a year's payment so that we would reduce our obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4504)|
| 1:15:10| I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| It would be my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4513)|
| 1:15:14| Commissioner Finkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| Richard, this is for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4516)|
| 1:15:17| You just might as well stand up here, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4521)|
| 1:15:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| We think we need to look at this budget a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| I realize the voters and we've all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| You've got your paperwork in ready to go, apparently, haven't you, to the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4527)|
| 1:15:33| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| You haven't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| How long would it take you to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4535)|
| 1:15:36| Oh, for the state board funding board application, I can have that done virtually immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4536)|
| 1:15:43| Would it be possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4543)|
| 1:15:44| But understand, Mr. Chairman, part of that paperwork is the authorization adopted by the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4544)|
| 1:15:49| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| But would it be possible for us to have a special call meeting just next week and vote on this budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4550)|
| 1:15:55| If you want to have a little hearing, have another budget hearing on it, or two weeks, would that bother you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4555)|
| 1:16:00| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| I think that would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| I mean, obviously, that's still early in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| That would be the best we could do, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| And that's what I'd like to make a recommendation do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| Failing knowing exactly what the funding board schedule is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4569)|
| 1:16:14| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4574)|
| 1:16:18| We could look at that, Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| I think if we could get proper notice out and have some kind of public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4580)|
| 1:16:25| and if the school board and us could get together within the next probably two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4585)|
| 1:16:30| and then come back here within two weeks maybe if we can get everything worked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| and give some people the opportunity to go over the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| There were some people who couldn't be here in the last budget because of prior obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4597)|
| 1:16:41| And we probably need to do a better job at making sure that we get enough notice out to the commissioners as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4601)|
| 1:16:47| so they can have their plan to be here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| Well, today is Tuesday, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| I've got my days all mixed up because it's holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4615)|
| 1:16:58| You know, I can't remember my days anyway since I retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4618)|
| 1:17:01| But let's make it ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4621)|
| 1:17:06| We don't want to do anything to circumvent this deal on these people that are retired out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4626)|
| 1:17:11| And we need to get it down there as soon as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| And I think we've got the TV here, two or three papers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4634)|
| 1:17:21| Ten days would be a Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| I'd kind of like to go on into that next week maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| And also just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| It would be nice if we could have this after business hour so other people can get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4649)|
| 1:17:40| Maybe sometime we'd like the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| Mr. Chairman, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| Could we hold up on this for just a few minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| and let me check the schedule on the state funding board to make sure we're not backing ourselves out of an opportunity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4668)|
| 1:17:54| Richard, I think we've got that being checked on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| Staff's calling right now to see when they meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| We're doing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| If we could have some public meeting, Commissioner Cate said after hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4681)|
| 1:18:08| sometime between the 4th and the 8th and within those days to having a meeting with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4688)|
| 1:18:19| Hopefully the legislature will be adjourned and we'll know what they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| and then maybe come back here sometime the 11th, 12th or 13th, sometime that week in June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4702)|
| 1:18:31| with a special call meeting to approve the budget if everything's in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4711)|
| 1:18:36| Could we have the hearing and then the special call meeting right after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| I'm just trying to save the number of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| We may be able to if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4723)|
| 1:18:44| You know, I'd like to have the workshop first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| and then have maybe we could do it after the school board if we had all the questions got answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4726)|
| 1:18:53| and nobody had to go back and research anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| So we might be able to do it all before the 8th of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4735)|
| 1:18:59| I think that would give us proper notice if we started doing notification today, public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4739)|
| 1:19:08| But everyone needs to check their calendars because, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| Before we set a date on it, I think it's going to be up to Richard in the state down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| whether we've got enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| They're the ones that are going to need to arrive at the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4758)|
| 1:19:23| We don't want to have it the 11th and that doesn't give them time, you understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4763)|
| 1:19:28| Yes, depending on what they come back with from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| Mr. Chairman, if I may, it would also be beneficial if we could go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4773)|
| 1:19:39| and at least adopt Resolution 804, which is the initial resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| and that gets the 20-day clock starting for the protest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4784)|
| 1:19:52| That initial resolution still requires that you adopt the other two detailed resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4792)|
| 1:19:57| before any debt is actually issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| We could get action on that today at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| That would help us with our timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4803)|
| 1:20:10| Can we pass that subject to budget approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| Will they accept it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4813)|
| 1:20:14| It is anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4814)|
| 1:20:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4815)|
| 1:20:16| If you adopt the initial resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| it means nothing unless you come back with a budget and adopt the two detailed resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4818)|
| 1:20:29| Do we want to go on and come back to this issue, commission, as soon as we find out from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4829)|
| 1:20:35| what their meeting date is, or do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| Star is on the phone with them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| Star is talking to Joe Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| Joe Lee is going to tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4843)|
| 1:20:48| They're still for a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| We're going to take a five-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| We'll take we'll stand in recess for five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4856)|
| 1:21:26| We'll take a five-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4886)|
| 1:21:56| We'll take a five-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4916)|
| 1:22:26| We'll take a five-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4946)|
| 1:22:56| We'll take a five-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=4976)|
| 1:23:26| We'll take a five-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5006)|
| 1:23:56| We'll take a five-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5036)|
| 1:24:27| We'll take a five-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5067)|
| 1:24:33| Okay, if commissioners take your seats, we'll finish up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5073)|
| 1:24:57| Okay, commissioners, take your seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| Commissioner, Mr. Chairman, I would like you to, just for the sake of parliamentary procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| restate the motion on the floor so we know what we're about to be voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| Well, we're waiting on the Joe Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| Was it they can meet as needed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5111)|
| 1:25:23| Okay, Mr. Beeler, it's as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| Well, yes, sir, I understand that's their explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5125)|
| 1:25:30| Now, a minute ago it was quarterly, so I mean it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| Well, they're meeting June 25th, so we could, if we did, if you adopted the initial resolution today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5132)|
| 1:25:41| and took final action on the detailed resolutions, we could meet that June 25th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5141)|
| 1:25:49| When would you have to have it before, when would you need it passed before June 25th to have it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5149)|
| 1:25:54| It has to go through David Bowling's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| You're talking at least a week ahead, I would, to be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5156)|
| 1:26:01| I mean, we would want to have it there at least a week, ten days before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5161)|
| 1:26:05| So if we could get everything done by the 15th or something like that, that would be fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5165)|
| 1:26:10| We could meet the state funding board requirement, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5173)|
| 1:26:14| And I don't know when they set their agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| Joe Lee is going to check on that, but I'm sure they would let us add on to their agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5176)|
| 1:26:22| I can't guarantee that, obviously, because I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5185)|
| 1:26:26| Commissioner Harmon, my motion would be to defer any items dealing with the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5186)|
| 1:26:31| until after a public meeting set after business hours, as Commissioner Kate requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5191)|
| 1:26:41| I also have a workshop with the Knox County School Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5201)|
| 1:26:48| So in practical terms, Mr. Chairman, is that items not only the incoming, but the outgoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5208)|
| 1:26:53| So that's items 801, 802, 803, 804, 805, and 806.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5213)|
| 1:26:59| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5219)|
| 1:27:00| But you want to go ahead and make an initial approval of the $87 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5224)|
| 1:27:05| That's resolution 804.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5225)|
| 1:27:06| So all those except for 804.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| I'll accept 804.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5228)|
| 1:27:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5229)|
| 1:27:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| If we could find out when this room is available in the evening, if that's the wish of the next week or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5237)|
| 1:27:28| and then take those items up except 804, which is only really starts at 20-day window we need to get by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5248)|
| 1:27:35| It doesn't really do anything other than get that out of the way so it doesn't become a handicap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5255)|
| 1:27:41| And then we can do all the things that you wish to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5261)|
| 1:27:46| So if we can find that date and time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5266)|
| 1:27:52| And I think it might be well taken that we have a lot of things left on this agenda today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5272)|
| 1:27:56| And in June, the regular meeting, we would have a lot of things beside the budget anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| So if we have a special meeting for that, then we can devote our entire time to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5280)|
| 1:28:07| And that might be well served if we can just find a time and a date to go ahead and accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5287)|
| 1:28:12| I think so, too, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| Mr. Toley, if you could maybe get a date as we take a recess later on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5294)|
| 1:28:18| if commissioners could see if they're going to be in town, what days they'd be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5298)|
| 1:28:22| Maybe by the end of the meeting we could come up with a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5302)|
| 1:28:26| Commissioner Moore, since we're getting ready to vote on this now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| why don't we have as part of your motion be that we will have a special meeting by a certain date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5309)|
| 1:28:38| Maybe that's the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| We could always move it up later in this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5319)|
| 1:28:44| but just for the practical purposes of voting to defer right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5324)|
| 1:28:49| is that we need to say we're going to have a special call meeting by a certain date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5329)|
| 1:28:53| Yeah, I wouldn't care adding we'll have a special call meeting by June the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5333)|
| 1:28:57| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| That keeps us within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5340)|
| 1:29:01| Is that the motion now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5341)|
| 1:29:02| I'll accept 804, which we would consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5342)|
| 1:29:05| I'll accept 804.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| I'm sorry, what was the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| Special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5349)|
| 1:29:12| Special meeting on or before June the 15th to be called by the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5352)|
| 1:29:21| And we're going to have a public meeting after hours, as you requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| and also a meeting, a workshop with the Knox County School Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5365)|
| 1:29:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5370)|
| 1:29:31| I've got one piece of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| The state funding board is scheduled to meet on June 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5373)|
| 1:29:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5377)|
| 1:29:38| You're about five minutes too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5378)|
| 1:29:39| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5379)|
| 1:29:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5383)|
| 1:29:44| Is there any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5384)|
| 1:29:45| Mr. Chairman, I just want to make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| We would not meet next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5387)|
| 1:29:48| I mean, as far as the full meeting to vote on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5391)|
| 1:29:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5392)|
| 1:29:53| My camera and I will both be on vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| Yes, that's why we're not together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5395)|
| 1:29:56| Not together, mind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| I just want to go ahead that I have family at work for Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5399)|
| 1:30:04| And I work for the Knox County trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5404)|

| 1:30:08| My wife works for the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| I'm an employee at Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5411)|

| 1:30:17| My wife works for the attorney general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5417)|
| 1:30:18| That's a state office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| I have friends that work in all levels of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5421)|
| 1:30:25| You do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5425)|
| 1:30:26| My man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5426)|
| 1:30:27| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5427)|
| 1:30:29| Mr. Chairman, there are, and I don't want to take up other people's time, what we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5429)|
| 1:30:33| but we all met with the school people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| I wanted to come down here and see if anything had changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| We have all met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5437)|
| 1:30:38| Several commissioners have met with the school system and went over every line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5438)|
| 1:30:42| Do we need to bring them back into this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| I hate to bring them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| Well, Commissioner, if they don't get what they needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| they're talking about taking money out that's in the great school partnership, the 6.5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5450)|
| 1:30:55| using it for whatever they deem priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| And you have a lot of people that spent a year over in the great school partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| and different little committees recommending TAP and birth to kindergarten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5463)|
| 1:31:08| And they've got a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| And they've already seen it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5470)|
| 1:31:11| Now, if that budget gets changed, either we need to give the school system more money so they don't change it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5471)|
| 1:31:17| or hopefully the state will come through with additional funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5477)|
| 1:31:20| We don't know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5480)|
| 1:31:21| So the school system can't tell us today that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5481)|
| 1:31:25| the great school partnership money budget would stay as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5485)|
| 1:31:30| or if they need additional funds to start the literacy program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| Who do you suggest that we meet with, the school board themselves or, like, Mr. Mullins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5494)|
| 1:31:39| Mr. Thomas and that group or both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| I think the administration could come and, you know, certainly invite the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| You know, they're the people who have to approve the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| So they need to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5512)|
| 1:31:53| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5515)|
| 1:31:56| Speaking of the greater school board partnership, outside of tax dollars, how much money are they raising?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5516)|
| 1:32:05| Not very much, but I hope to improve on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5525)|
| 1:32:07| When you look at our other initiatives that we've identified and funded, we've had some great success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5527)|
| 1:32:13| One example, many of you attended our senior summit, which was held just recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5533)|
| 1:32:19| Private sector dollars were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| Our first day festival, private sector dollars again, imagination library, same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5541)|
| 1:32:28| where I think the great schools partnership has not done a fulfilling role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5548)|
| 1:32:33| and I think they've done a lot of very, very good things, has been the fact that they haven't identified projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5553)|
| 1:32:38| for the private sector to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| I'm going to be presenting them or I'm going to be working on a fundraising initiative for Beaumont Elementary School myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5560)|
| 1:32:46| beginning tomorrow, to help fund something that they're trying to do outside of tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5566)|
| 1:32:51| But we've had a couple of education summits which have been funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| We have a couple of donors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| But we haven't really done a very good job of asking, and I think that's why we haven't been successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5576)|
| 1:33:00| The projects we've had in Knox County where we've asked, like the ones I've mentioned, we've done quite well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5580)|
| 1:33:05| The others, we haven't been as successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| I just think it's a great opportunity to do some good, and I just think that we need to go out there and ask for that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5587)|
| 1:33:15| because I think we'll get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5595)|
| 1:33:16| I think that we have an opportunity if we can define specific programs and projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5596)|
| 1:33:21| So I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5605)|
| 1:33:26| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5606)|
| 1:33:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5609)|
| 1:33:30| The law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5610)|
| 1:33:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5611)|
| 1:33:32| We haven't covered this in a while, and let me just briefly go through something for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5612)|
| 1:33:39| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| We've got a tank in one ear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5621)|
| 1:33:45| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| The charter of Knox County says that any member of the commission who is also an employee of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5628)|
| 1:33:53| may vote on matters in which he has a conflict of interest arising from his or her employment with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| if the member informs the commission immediately prior to the vote as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| Quote, because I'm an employee of, wherever you're an employee, I have a conflict of interest in a proposal about to be voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5642)|
| 1:34:10| However, I declare that my argument and my vote answer only to my conscience and to my obligation to my constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5650)|
| 1:34:16| and to the citizens this body represents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| End quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| That's obviously if you're an employee of part of Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| State law provides a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5664)|
| 1:34:28| One, if you are an employee first and commissioner second, then you may vote on an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5668)|
| 1:34:42| If you're a commissioner first and an employee of county government second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| and an issue that is related to your governmental unit, you are forbidden from voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5686)|
| 1:34:52| I don't believe we have any commissioner who was first a county commissioner and then an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5692)|
| 1:35:01| If we do, let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5701)|
| 1:35:05| Finally, we have a code of ethics that was adopted by this body, which went into effect February 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5705)|
| 1:35:13| It is a little bit different in that it is with regard to a financial interest of the official or of the official or employee's spouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5713)|
| 1:35:28| So, it would either be your financial interest or that of your spouse or child living in the same household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5728)|
| 1:35:35| And if that is the case, you're not prohibited from voting, but you shall disclose prior to the vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5735)|
| 1:35:43| and that disclosure is to be recorded in the minutes of this body, any personal interest that affects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5743)|
| 1:35:49| or would lead a reasonable person to infer that it affects the official's vote on the measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5749)|
| 1:35:58| So, I offer that for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| Mr. Law Director, does each member need to go back and say the words that you just said, or have we already done that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5761)|
| 1:36:11| I would advise that you ought to each, because it is a quote that is directly from our charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5771)|
| 1:36:21| and it's also the same quote, by the way, in state law, which I'm sure this is where our charter quote came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5781)|
| 1:36:29| Basically, it is a declaration that you will, that you have a conflict of interest because you work for a certain governmental unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5789)|
| 1:36:37| and that you declare that your argument and vote answer only to your conscience and to your obligation to your constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5797)|
| 1:36:43| and to the citizens this body represents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| Okay. Do you have copies of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| I can pass it around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| Might as well start with one end and go to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5809)|
| 1:36:53| I'll start here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| Mr. Chairman, can I ask the Law Director a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| Mr. Law Director, since that provision is in the charter, and I helped draft that charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5820)|
| 1:37:08| and I think since that's the charter provision, I would think if commissioners revealed a conflict based on the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5828)|
| 1:37:17| they said this is a conflict based on our charter, and our charter is written and people should know what's in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5837)|
| 1:37:25| and then they would have a conflict under the ethics one if they would reveal those two, those are the two types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5845)|
| 1:37:32| So I would think if those were revealed at the top of a meeting, if every meeting would that cover those items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5852)|
| 1:37:43| or would it have to be specific to the item passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| It says to be recorded in the minutes, but the question is where in the minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5867)|
| 1:37:52| if it was done at the top of the meeting for every meeting and those would be standard revealing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5872)|
| 1:37:58| then it would be revealed at every time we had a meeting and would cover everything that was covered in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5878)|
| 1:38:05| Let me look at our ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| Under the charter, it appears that you could accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5887)|
| 1:38:12| But with our new ethics policy, give me just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5892)|
| 1:38:18| It says it should be in the minutes and doesn't really say where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| It will be included in the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5901)|
| 1:38:26| It says that you have to make the disclosure before the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5906)|
| 1:38:31| Stop the meeting before the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| Yes, but you would need to identify what provisions I would think that you would have a conflict of interest in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5914)|
| 1:38:41| Well, the difficulty is that this is to inform, I guess, fellow commissioners and the general public of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5921)|
| 1:38:52| There are some items that only are remotely connected to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5932)|
| 1:38:57| And somebody will say, well, it is connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| And you would make the commissioner have to say, well, that's close enough or not close enough to reveal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5939)|
| 1:39:04| Sometimes it's obvious and sometimes it's not obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| But somebody can make a case that, well, there is some connection between that item and your employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5948)|
| 1:39:14| So if it was right at the top, that would cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5954)|
| 1:39:19| Because I'm not sure everyone would understand that for every possible issue, there is a connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5959)|
| 1:39:24| Some are obvious and some are conjecture on somebody's part that there is a connection to your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5964)|
| 1:39:33| I believe the Code of Ethics is a little more specific than the Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5973)|
| 1:39:39| And I'm sure there's an argument to be made, even for the Charter, that you would need to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5979)|
| 1:39:44| It's somewhat of an inconvenience, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5984)|
| 1:39:49| But even the Charter could be read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| You could certainly argue that you would need to read it after each vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5991)|
| 1:39:56| Because even in the quote, it says, I have a conflict of interest in the proposal about to be voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=5996)|
| 1:40:04| Well, that's per matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6004)|
| 1:40:09| So it is somewhat specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6009)|
| 1:40:13| Mr. Law Director, could we not then point out each resolution or item that will be on the agenda for that day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6013)|
| 1:40:25| that you might possibly have a conflict?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6025)|
| 1:40:28| Would that not take care of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| Like, could we at the very top say, here's our standard disclosure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6031)|
| 1:40:35| and here's the items that we feel that there might be a conflict with and then proceed on from that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6035)|
| 1:40:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| I see no reason why you couldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6043)|
| 1:40:49| It would certainly require, you know, you to have some preparation in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6049)|
| 1:40:56| Well, I think we need to be prepared for each meeting anyway, so you might as well be prepared to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6056)|
| 1:41:00| For this vote, for this vote right here, for the motion that's on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6060)|
| 1:41:04| it's been made easy because you have about six or so matters that are included in the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6064)|
| 1:41:12| And then just take each one, at least today, as they come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6072)|
| 1:41:17| But for this one, I believe you, I mean, I would advise any member that has a conflict of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6077)|
| 1:41:24| has a financial interest, either a relationship to one of the matters that's up for vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6084)|
| 1:41:33| or a relationship, a spouse or a family member living with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6093)|
| 1:41:41| that might be tied into one of the budget resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6104)|
| 1:41:45| I'm an employee of the trustee's office, which is a fee office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6105)|
| 1:41:51| And salaries are not set by the budget for fee offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6111)|
| 1:41:56| It's set by a salary suit, which is heard by a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6116)|
| 1:42:01| In your opinion, does that mean that I have a conflict of interest on the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6121)|
| 1:42:05| Still, I'm not going to sit here today and issue, you know, opinions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6125)|
| 1:42:09| conflict of interest opinions for everybody here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6129)|
| 1:42:13| Your budget is included in the budget that is here before you, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6133)|
| 1:42:20| And I know that there's also a salary suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| But if you work for a governmental unit whose budget is included in the matters that were just included in the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6143)|
| 1:42:31| I would advise, certainly, to follow the dictates of the charter and of the new code of ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6151)|
| 1:42:43| The charter, if you're an employee of a governmental unit, all right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6163)|
| 1:42:47| if you are, if it is a spouse or a child living with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6167)|
| 1:42:55| then I would disclose the fact that I had a spouse that worked for a certain governmental unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6175)|
| 1:43:02| And I would state that my argument and my vote answer only to my conscience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6182)|
| 1:43:09| and to my obligation to my constituents and the citizens this body represents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6189)|
| 1:43:16| I'm prepared to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6198)|
| 1:43:19| I'll go ahead and start because my wife is an employee of the Knox County Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6199)|
| 1:43:22| I have a conflict of interest in a proposal about to be voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6202)|
| 1:43:26| However, I declare my argument and my vote answer only to my conscience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6206)|
| 1:43:31| and to my obligation to my constituents and to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6211)|
| 1:43:50| Because I am an employee of Knox County Juvenile Court Clerk's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6230)|
| 1:43:58| I have a conflict of interest in the proposal about to be voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6238)|
| 1:44:02| However, I believe that my argument and my vote answer only to my conscience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6242)|
| 1:44:07| and to my obligation to my constituents and the citizens of this body represents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6247)|
| 1:44:13| And this also includes my husband, who works for the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6253)|
| 1:44:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6268)|
| 1:44:43| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6283)|
| 1:44:58| Because my wife is an employee of the Sheriff's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| I have a conflict of interest in the proposal about to be voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6302)|
| 1:45:05| However, I declare that my argument and my vote answer only to my conscience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6305)|
| 1:45:09| and to my obligation to my constituents and to the citizens of this body represents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6309)|
| 1:45:28| It applies just if she lives with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| I don't have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6331)|
| 1:45:33| What did he say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| He's in the barn out back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6335)|
| 1:45:41| Commissioners, we'll include this in your packet, so it'll be easier from now on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6341)|
| 1:45:47| The problem with it is if you don't make the declaration and it is challenged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6347)|
| 1:45:51| then your vote on a matter is void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| Because I'm an employee of the Knox County Trustee's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| I have a conflict of interest in the proposal about to be voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6358)|

| 1:46:36| I have a conflict of interest in the proposal about to be voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6396)|

| 1:46:51| Where is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6411)|
| 1:46:59| Because I'm an employee of Knox County Schools, as well as my wife,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6419)|
| 1:47:05| the law director tells me I have a conflict of interest in the proposal about to be voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6425)|
| 1:47:13| However, I declare that my argument and my vote will answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6433)|
| 1:47:20| as it always has, only to my conscience and to my obligation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6440)|

| 1:48:06| Okay. Hopefully we're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6486)|
| 1:48:10| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| John Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| We have to read this every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| I think everybody knows what we've got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6496)|
| 1:48:20| I'll be glad to give you an opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6500)|
| 1:48:23| This, the answer is maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6503)|
| 1:48:29| It is an inconvenience, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6509)|
| 1:48:32| I mean, I feel the pressure from you, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| I'm not worried about people knowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| And the thing is, we may be able to come up with a procedure that this body could adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6516)|
| 1:48:43| that would simplify it some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| And certainly it wouldn't be as cumbersome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6525)|
| 1:48:48| But give me some time to work with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| Well, at least we've gone for almost half right to maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6531)|
| 1:48:58| Okay. We're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| Everybody understand what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| No. Haven't a clue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6542)|
| 1:49:03| Don't make us say it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6543)|
| 1:49:07| So we'll try it with a voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6547)|
| 1:49:10| All in favor of postponing the meeting until we have a public meeting and a workshop with the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6550)|
| 1:49:18| And we'll have it done before June 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6558)|
| 1:49:21| So all in favor of that say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6563)|

| 1:49:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6565)|
| 1:49:26| And Commissioner Harmon was the only no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| Mr. Chairman, if you're going to vote on a budget matter, I should have mentioned this earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6569)|
| 1:49:34| Again, I apologize, but this needs to be a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6574)|
| 1:49:39| You want to start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6579)|
| 1:49:40| It's a continuation item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6580)|
| 1:49:41| Basically what you're doing, you're moving to move the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6581)|
| 1:49:46| But out of an abundance of caution, I would have a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6586)|
| 1:49:52| All right, clerk, call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| Mr. Chairman, could I have the floor for a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| We're in the middle of a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6598)|
| 1:49:59| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6599)|
| 1:50:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6600)|
| 1:50:01| Powell Middle School, is there a provision to get going on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6601)|
| 1:50:07| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6607)|
| 1:50:09| We're going to take up the bond issue of $87 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6609)|
| 1:50:15| So that is not being deferred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| That is not being deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6617)|
| 1:50:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6618)|

| 1:51:30| Okay, we need to go back and take care of a couple of items that didn't get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6690)|
| 1:51:33| Mr. Chairman, since we've already discussed it, can we just go ahead and do the $87 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6693)|
| 1:51:39| I'll move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6699)|

| 1:51:41| 804.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6701)|
| 1:51:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6702)|
| 1:51:43| Any discussion on 804?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| Seeing none, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6706)|
| 1:51:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6708)|
| 1:51:49| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| And ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6711)|
| 1:51:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| Resolution 111 has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6715)|
| 1:51:59| Resolution 702 has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6719)|
| 1:52:03| A minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6723)|
| 1:52:11| What page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6731)|
| 1:52:14| 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6734)|
| 1:52:17| Withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6737)|
| 1:52:19| Scott, over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| Florico and they had to leave for the stormwater thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| I don't know if we could take them out of order if they're prepared to go forward now or we could defer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6746)|
| 1:52:35| If we have no objections from the commission, we could hear Ms. Cole now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6755)|
| 1:52:41| Anybody object?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6761)|
| 1:52:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6764)|
| 1:52:45| Ms. Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6765)|
| 1:52:50| Let me finish this right here that we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6770)|
| 1:52:54| Page 18, 702.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6774)|
| 1:52:57| 18, number 702.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6777)|
| 1:53:00| Withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6780)|
| 1:53:01| Withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6781)|
| 1:53:02| Withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6782)|
| 1:53:03| And 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| Withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6785)|
| 1:53:06| We need to add resolution 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6786)|
| 1:53:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6802)|
| 1:53:23| And we have two ordinances, 0-07-5-101, deferred until June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6803)|
| 1:53:29| 0-075-102, defer that until June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6809)|
| 1:53:33| Also, we need to add resolution 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6813)|
| 1:53:37| It is dealing with the arts alliance and the grants that we discussed last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6817)|
| 1:53:48| And also we need to add 105.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6828)|
| 1:53:51| It's a resolution honoring Doug Goddard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6831)|
| 1:53:54| He's the director of the County Commissioner Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6834)|
| 1:53:56| He'll be retiring, and they're going to be honoring him up in Gatlinburg on June 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6836)|
| 1:54:03| So if we could add those and withdraw those and defer the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6843)|
| 1:54:07| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6847)|
| 1:54:08| Any objections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6848)|
| 1:54:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6849)|
| 1:54:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6850)|
| 1:54:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6851)|
| 1:54:12| And the law director has one more we need to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| Gee, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| There was a resolution that this body passed last year for a study by the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6856)|
| 1:54:25| for certain elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| Elected officials by state law can participate in the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6868)|
| 1:54:36| And this body authorized an actuarial study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6876)|
| 1:54:42| I do not have the resolution before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6882)|
| 1:54:44| I was told about it at 2 o'clock when we walked in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6884)|
| 1:54:49| It was a resolution, the exact same resolution that we adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6889)|
| 1:54:55| I believe it was December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6895)|
| 1:54:57| It could have been a little earlier than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6897)|
| 1:54:58| I don't know if anybody was or if anybody remembers that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6898)|
| 1:55:09| If I had the details of it, I could certainly give you better information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6909)|
| 1:55:12| But it requires a cost of $310.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6912)|
| 1:55:18| And I believe Mike Lowe is one of the chief persons who wishes to have this study conducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6918)|
| 1:55:26| And I believe he and there's three others who wish to also have this actuarial study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6926)|
| 1:55:33| And I'm told that they are going to pay the $310 themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6933)|
| 1:55:39| And so it is going to be a resolution identical to the one that we did several months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6939)|
| 1:55:49| The study that was performed several months ago included a number of other officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6949)|
| 1:55:54| Several officials decided not to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| They decided not to do it, which then that requires another study because they come up with one number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6956)|
| 1:56:02| for all the participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6962)|
| 1:56:04| So that's why we're back before you or Mr. Lowe is back before you with another resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6964)|
| 1:56:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6972)|
| 1:56:13| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6973)|
| 1:56:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6974)|
| 1:56:15| Based on what the law director said, I would move that we would add that item to the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6975)|
| 1:56:19| and I presume he would draft something for us to take up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6979)|
| 1:56:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6983)|
| 1:56:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6986)|
| 1:56:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6987)|
| 1:56:28| Ms. Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6988)|
| 1:56:38| Laura Cole, 316 Bob Smith Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=6998)|
| 1:56:41| First, I want to say that I know some of you glaze over when I talk about stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7001)|
| 1:56:45| but after the budget discussion today, I think we're even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7005)|
| 1:56:52| Some of you may remember last month I brought you some pictures of stormwater runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7012)|
| 1:56:58| And my biggest concern was that the storm sewer system was bypassing the detention structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7018)|
| 1:57:04| and going straight into the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| There's also a concern about the sedimentation that's already occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7027)|
| 1:57:11| Any disturbance in my stream now stirs up clouds of red clay mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7031)|
| 1:57:17| Last month, Mr. Granger pointed out that by his estimation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7037)|
| 1:57:22| the developers have done everything possible and that the state or TDEC was okay with everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7042)|
| 1:57:28| And there weren't any problems that the developer had done everything that he could to take care of those problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7048)|
| 1:57:35| Today, I wanted to bring you letters that the state sent to the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7055)|
| 1:57:41| and CC Knox County Commission on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| I'm sorry, Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7063)|
| 1:57:46| Commissioner Norman has copies of those reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7066)|
| 1:57:49| and I wanted you to see them because those reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7069)|
| 1:57:52| there are five of them that were sent out at different times over the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7072)|
| 1:57:56| They cite the violations, they document the problems, and they also make recommended solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7076)|
| 1:58:04| And I wanted to point out to you that the October 20, 2006 NOV documents that the state is questioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7084)|
| 1:58:12| whether or not that storm sewer system is being routed to the detention structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7092)|
| 1:58:17| It also questions that in the next NOV, January of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7097)|
| 1:58:24| This request was repeated in the fifth NOV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| and the state also asked the developer to provide a plan for removing accumulated sediment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7107)|
| 1:58:36| To my knowledge, none of these activities have been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7116)|
| 1:58:40| The state also asked that the stormwater pollution prevention plan be updated by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7120)|
| 1:58:45| I don't know that that's been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7125)|
| 1:58:47| I don't have any evidence of that, but Mr. Grange, you may know a little bit more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7127)|
| 1:58:51| I did want to bring that to you today because I believe that it's important for you to understand what's happening in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7131)|
| 1:58:58| This is a real problem, that we have a problem with the identification, communication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| and enforcement of regulatory problems before, during, and post construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7142)|
| 1:59:09| I ask that you pay close attention to the new ordinance that will come before you in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7149)|
| 1:59:15| For Knox County, this is a growing problem and an expensive one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7155)|
| 1:59:23| It's a regulatory problem, and political solutions aren't going to take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7163)|
| 1:59:27| So I ask that you consider carefully the new ordinance as it comes before you within the next couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7167)|
| 1:59:34| And I think Chris Grange wants to update you on some meetings that we've had on site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7174)|
| 1:59:38| to talk about addressing some of the problems that you saw in the pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7178)|
| 1:59:42| So I'm going to ask Chris to give you an update on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7182)|
| 1:59:54| We met following the meeting last month, the commission meeting last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7194)|
| 1:59:59| Actually had several meetings on site at Graysburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7199)|
| 2:00:03| And following those meetings, there were repairs that were ordered to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7203)|
| 2:00:09| Things in the erosion control, the sill fence, installation of grass and grass seed and straw for ground cover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7209)|
| 2:00:18| and installation of erosion sediment control matting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7218)|
| 2:00:22| It's true that in 2006, there were a lot of problems on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7222)|
| 2:00:30| And I probably, when I spoke at the commission meeting last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7230)|
| 2:00:34| I was really talking about the current conditions and reflecting the conversations that I've had with the TDEC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7234)|
| 2:00:40| with the TDEC field inspectors and management staff who have indicated that the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7240)|
| 2:00:47| and contractor are doing everything that's been asked of them and generally following the plans and requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7247)|
| 2:00:56| And they didn't feel like they were mounting issues or reasons for notices of violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7256)|
| 2:01:02| But in fact, there were a lot of problems leading up, I guess, in the summer of 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7262)|
| 2:01:07| that led up to the original site grading contractor to leave the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7267)|
| 2:01:13| and really left it with a mess that needed a lot of cleaning up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7273)|
| 2:01:17| I did actually had requested all of the state's files from TDEC and got those last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7277)|
| 2:01:26| actually late last week, and sent an email to the commission email address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7286)|
| 2:01:31| I don't know if any of you actually got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7291)|
| 2:01:35| But it's a two-page summary of basically our department's history with the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7295)|
| 2:01:42| from the rezoning up until the commission meeting last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7302)|
| 2:01:52| Let me go ahead and add something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| I have been out there and worked with Laura and now Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7314)|
| 2:01:58| And I must say that we're working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7318)|
| 2:02:01| The good part about it is that we're working with good people, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7321)|
| 2:02:05| Laura has certainly been patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| You know, sometimes to put one of these, I guess, water runoff systems in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7328)|
| 2:02:15| you have to go out there and break the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7335)|
| 2:02:17| It's a while before those will get it in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7337)|
| 2:02:20| The improvements that I've seen is there's not quite as much mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7340)|
| 2:02:24| The water is still cloudy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7344)|
| 2:02:27| There's some, I guess, use or misuse of an existing pond versus a settlement type pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7347)|
| 2:02:40| The other thing is there's a great concern about the phase two part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7360)|
| 2:02:44| in which plans have been submitted, but they've not been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7364)|
| 2:02:48| But I think I can say that as far as the water runoff today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7368)|
| 2:02:56| it's much better than before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7376)|
| 2:02:59| Of course, we're way below rainfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7379)|
| 2:03:02| I don't know how that may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7382)|
| 2:03:04| But, Laura, would you say that there's been some improvement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7384)|
| 2:03:09| There's only been one rain event since last month, and you were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7389)|
| 2:03:22| And the water was cloudy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7402)|
| 2:03:23| It wasn't as muddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7403)|
| 2:03:24| But, again, we're in a drought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7404)|
| 2:03:26| And, I mean, I hesitate to say that it's improved until I see how it behaves under normal conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7406)|
| 2:03:31| But my hope is that it will improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7411)|
| 2:03:36| But, again, until we confirm the way that water is being routed underground, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7416)|
| 2:03:43| there's going to be a concern about how it's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7423)|
| 2:03:49| Commissioner Ivan Horman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7429)|
| 2:03:51| Chris, did you say something about an NOV?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7431)|
| 2:03:53| Have you issued an NOV, or have you thought about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7433)|
| 2:03:57| Our department has not issued a notice of violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7437)|
| 2:04:00| We've issued actually several, if you look through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7440)|
| 2:04:04| I've spent a lot of time looking at our own inspector's notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7444)|
| 2:04:07| and virtually every conversation has functionally consisted of a notice of violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7447)|
| 2:04:13| in that deficiencies were noted and corrections ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7453)|
| 2:04:17| But the fact is that at each point, corrections were made in a prompt, timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7457)|
| 2:04:23| TDAC has a slightly different process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7463)|
| 2:04:25| And so they did issue, they ended up issuing notices of violation following the events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7465)|
| 2:04:32| that led up to the contractor leaving the site in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7472)|
| 2:04:36| So the state did issue an NOV, but we have not, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7476)|
| 2:04:39| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7479)|
| 2:04:42| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7482)|
| 2:04:44| Laura, would you ñ there were five violations, I think, that TDAC issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7484)|
| 2:04:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7493)|
| 2:04:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7495)|
| 2:04:56| In your opinion, are all of those, as Mr. Grangey just said, are all those being addressed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7496)|
| 2:05:03| I guess there are probably some overlapping violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7503)|
| 2:05:08| I don't know that the SWIP has been revised, the stormwater pollution plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7508)|
| 2:05:14| I don't know that it's actually been revised by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7514)|
| 2:05:18| I can't confirm that unless I see a copy of that, and I'd have to get that from TDAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7518)|
| 2:05:24| I don't know that the developer has come up with a plan to remove the sediment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7524)|
| 2:05:29| And I also ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7529)|
| 2:05:30| You're talking about sediment that has already been deposited in your stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7530)|
| 2:05:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7534)|
| 2:05:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7535)|
| 2:05:36| Is that a requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7536)|
| 2:05:38| Is that a requirement given?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7538)|
| 2:05:40| That's a requirement from the state, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7540)|
| 2:05:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7542)|
| 2:05:43| Are there fines involved here, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7543)|
| 2:05:46| Are there fines potentially involved for the developer given, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7546)|
| 2:05:53| if he's not addressing the complaints in a proper time period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7553)|
| 2:06:01| I would say yes in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7561)|
| 2:06:03| I don't know if you mean on the part of from TDAC or from Knox County, but I guess either would be yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7563)|
| 2:06:10| Either?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7570)|
| 2:06:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7571)|
| 2:06:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7572)|
| 2:06:13| What kind of fines would we be talking about from Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7573)|
| 2:06:15| Well, using the language ñ well, actually, with the new ordinance in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7575)|
| 2:06:19| we have language that will allow us to actually state a fine amount based on the cost for mediation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7579)|
| 2:06:27| also somewhat based on a standard or a menu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7587)|
| 2:06:31| But that language isn't in place yet as to what the fine might be or what the transgression might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7591)|
| 2:06:38| All that's to be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7598)|
| 2:06:40| In general, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7600)|
| 2:06:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7601)|
| 2:06:47| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7607)|
| 2:06:49| I was just wondering if we could move this resolution on and Ms. Harve up before we go to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7609)|
| 2:06:53| That's going to be the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7613)|
| 2:06:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7619)|
| 2:07:00| Thank you, Ms. Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7620)|
| 2:07:01| Clerk, if we could do 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7621)|
| 2:07:07| This is a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, honoring Melanie Harve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7627)|
| 2:07:11| principal of New Hope Valley Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7631)|
| 2:07:15| Okay. Motion by Commissioner Pinkston, seconded by Commissioner Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7635)|
| 2:07:19| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7639)|
| 2:07:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7641)|
| 2:07:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7642)|
| 2:07:23| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7643)|
| 2:07:24| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7644)|
| 2:07:25| Clerk, if you'd read it into the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7645)|
| 2:07:29| Melanie Harve was one of 18 principals honored in Nashville as one of the state's most effective elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7649)|
| 2:07:34| and middle school principals based on value-added performance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7654)|
| 2:07:38| an assessment that measures achievement gain in a way that permits schools to be compared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7658)|
| 2:07:43| regardless of the makeup of the student body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7663)|
| 2:07:46| And whereas Melanie Harve won second place for East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7666)|
| 2:07:50| and plans to put the $2,000 prize into staff development at New Hope Valley Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7670)|
| 2:07:58| And whereas Melanie Harve exemplifies the New Hope Valley Elementary School mission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7678)|
| 2:08:02| in attempting to create a caring place to learn while doing her personal best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7682)|
| 2:08:06| to help her students become productive citizens with good character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7686)|
| 2:08:12| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7692)|
| 2:08:16| The Commission of Knox County salutes Melanie Harve for her caring and outstanding efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7696)|
| 2:08:20| which have enabled her students at New Hope Valley Elementary School to become the best they can be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7700)|
| 2:08:27| and in doing so, she has made the New Hope Valley community in Knox County better places to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7707)|
| 2:08:38| Thank you so very much for this recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7718)|
| 2:08:40| I appreciate it kindly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7720)|
| 2:08:42| But please know that it was not my work alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7722)|
| 2:08:45| I had two educators that were supposed to come down with me, Ms. Patty Hahn and Ms. Paulette Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7725)|
| 2:08:50| They've been at New Hope Valley for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7730)|
| 2:08:53| They sit on leadership teams, and they are an integral part of the success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7733)|
| 2:08:57| as well as the community, the volunteers, County Commissioner Paul Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7737)|
| 2:09:02| I know Mr. Green has already been at my school, former County Commissioner Larry Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7742)|
| 2:09:06| And, of course, it can't be said with those higher up, Superintendent Mullins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7746)|
| 2:09:11| and Dr. Donna Wright has always been supportive of everything that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7751)|
| 2:09:15| It is a group effort and a team effort, and we'll continue to do the best that we can to support the children of New Hope well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7755)|
| 2:09:20| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7760)|
| 2:09:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7763)|
| 2:09:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7772)|
| 2:09:35| Okay, Clerk, if we could do 104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7775)|
| 2:09:46| Okay, we've got a motion to approve by Commissioner Strickland, seconded by Commissioner Jordan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7786)|
| 2:10:00| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7800)|
| 2:10:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7801)|
| 2:10:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7802)|
| 2:10:03| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7803)|
| 2:10:04| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7804)|
| 2:10:05| Clerk, if you'll read it into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7805)|
| 2:10:08| Whereas many attribute the profound academic improvements at Lonsdale Elementary School in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7808)|
| 2:10:14| to the leadership of Principal Lisa Light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7814)|
| 2:10:17| and whereas Lisa Light has implemented effective strategies in curriculum and instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7817)|
| 2:10:23| that have provided a complex structure of expectations and benchmarks to help Lonsdale students improve their learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7823)|
| 2:10:30| and whereas in the three years that Lisa Light has been principal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7830)|
| 2:10:33| student scores on the Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program have increased by at least 13 percentage points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7833)|
| 2:10:40| in reading, math, science, and social studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7840)|
| 2:10:44| and whereas Lonsdale Elementary School has been recognized as a model for public education throughout the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7844)|
| 2:10:50| and was selected by Governor Phil Bredesen for the launch of his statewide pre-K program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7850)|
| 2:10:56| now therefore be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7856)|
| 2:11:00| The Commission of Knox County salutes Lisa Light for her caring and outstanding efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7860)|
| 2:11:05| which have enabled her students at Lonsdale Elementary School to become the best they can be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7865)|
| 2:11:11| and in doing so has made both the Lonsdale community and Knox County better places to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7871)|
| 2:11:19| Recognize Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7879)|
| 2:11:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7882)|
| 2:11:24| Commissioner Jordan and I have been out to Lonsdale several, several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7884)|
| 2:11:29| I would like to say that Ms. Lisa Light, she runs a tight ship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7889)|
| 2:11:34| The students, the parents, and her teachers, and Jean Anderson, I talked to her the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7894)|
| 2:11:39| and she said that the dedication, the love, and the drive that she presents to the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7899)|
| 2:11:44| this honor is a great honor for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7904)|
| 2:11:47| She's also won the Millican Award, which not many people win it, and also she was principal of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7907)|
| 2:11:53| So I applaud her efforts and thank her for everything she's doing in the community of Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7913)|
| 2:11:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7919)|
| 2:12:12| Also I want to add that she received an award of $25,000 for the Millican Award,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7932)|
| 2:12:19| and with that money was her own personal money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7939)|
| 2:12:22| She threw a block party for the community as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7942)|
| 2:12:28| I want to thank you for this honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7948)|
| 2:12:30| I wish you were third graders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7950)|
| 2:12:32| I'd be much more comfortable standing up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7952)|
| 2:12:35| But I am just honored and blessed to be the principal at Lonsdale Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7955)|
| 2:12:39| and I have the most dedicated staff and the most wonderful children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part1?start=7959)|
