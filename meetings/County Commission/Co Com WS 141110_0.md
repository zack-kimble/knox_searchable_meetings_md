| 0:07:28| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=448)|
| 0:07:38| And before we continue any further, before we call the roll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| Dr. Briggs, please come back to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| I believe that there are some people here that may not be familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| with your most recent pronouncement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| Well, this is the day that I'm going to resign for the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| and it really and truly is a bittersweet moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| Many of us, I think there's only three or four of us that are left on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| originally maybe five altogether, that came on the commission in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| At least the public's perception at that time was that we were not doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=490)|
| 0:08:15| as good a job as we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| I think over the last nearly seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| the perception of the county commission has changed a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| And I know when I say now that I'm a member of the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| and a member of the county government, I'm very proud of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| because I think that there's no self-interest on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| We play by the rules, and we're doing what we're supposed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| which is represent the interest of the citizens of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| I'm going to stop right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| I don't know where the future will take me, but I can tell you the nearly seven years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| that I spent on the county commission are some of the years that I'm the most proud of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| of anything that I've done in my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| and there'll never be a better job than what you've got right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=539)|
| 0:09:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=555)|

| 0:15:09| No, 33 is deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=909)|
| 0:15:16| Page 10, item 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| And the last page, 11, item 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=920)|
| 0:15:33| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| There may be one more to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| Mr. King told me earlier that he had sent a letter to Brad requesting postponement on number 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=940)|
| 0:15:52| That's Patrick Tracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| Should we go ahead and run that in the record, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| Is that fine with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| Be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| 60 days to the January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=960)|
| 0:16:06| And although that was to be considered Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| it's a good thing to let people know that it's not being considered Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=975)|
| 0:16:21| It's been deferred until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=981)|
| 0:16:29| I need a motion now to approve the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| Don't move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| Motion properly before us and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| The agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| Question, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| When I'm looking at the zoning agenda for next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1009)|
| 0:16:58| there's not anything left except that presentation by PBS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1018)|
| 0:17:04| Can we not add that on to the end of the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| There's another zoning item, number 39.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| Where at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| It's on page 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| Item 39, page 11, is the only standing item that's on zoning for Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1032)|
| 0:17:18| We will have to meet at that announced date and time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| John said he was deferring 39 also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| 39 is in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| So for that one item, we will meet at that appointed, announced time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| I thought he had said that one earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| I'm going to pause this for just a second, and we're going to have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| Is anyone wishing to speak before Knox County Commission on any item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1066)|
| 0:17:55| Sir, please give your name and address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1075)|
| 0:18:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| My name is Dr. Kent Van Cleve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| I live at 8506 Trout Drive, mascot 37806.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1086)|
| 0:18:14| Originally, I was going to ask the commission to consider withdrawal of security measures on the courthouse under Fourth Amendment grounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1094)|
| 0:18:24| I spoke with the security officers, and they said they turn about a gun a month away here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| So I'm withdrawing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| I do want to speak about a couple of other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| First of all, and I did a little quick research on this, Texas Transportation Institute says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1118)|
| 0:18:50| depending on where you live and where you travel, we spend about 17 to 55 hours of delay time at traffic signals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1130)|
| 0:19:01| and traffic jams and that sort of thing a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1141)|
| 0:19:08| I was looking at Missouri Route 291 in Lee's Summit, Missouri, where they have used a system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1148)|
| 0:19:16| It's called an adaptive traffic signal system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| It's a two-and-a-half-mile stretch of road with 12 signalized intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1161)|
| 0:19:27| Since they installed this NSYNC system, they estimate that they're saving 135,000 wait hours a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1167)|
| 0:19:43| about 138,000 gallons of fuel a year, 225,000 pounds of carbon monoxide emissions a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1183)|
| 0:19:54| and $3,700,000 a year through the elimination of a tremendous amount of the stops that were normally seen on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1194)|
| 0:20:06| It's like Europe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| In the European Parliament, the European Union in 2010 adopted Directive 2010-40-EU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1210)|
| 0:20:22| which sets out a seven-year time period over which the European Union would adopt these kinds of intelligent traffic control systems throughout Europe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1222)|
| 0:20:35| Here in Knox County, I was on the website for traffic engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| and there are no such initiatives that I can find on their website which are underway in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1240)|
| 0:20:48| I'm asking the Commission to consider directing the traffic engineering people to investigate these systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1248)|
| 0:20:57| and institute them where possible in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| If you look at that amount of savings over a two-and-a-half-mile stretch of road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1260)|
| 0:21:07| since that's been adopted there, it's saved the equivalent of a human lifetime in wait time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1267)|
| 0:21:17| So that's the first thing that I want to ask you about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| is to consider instituting that kind of traffic control here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1280)|
| 0:21:28| It might be good to get some cooperation from Knox City as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| Dwight Eisenhower is fondly remembered for starting the interstate system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1293)|
| 0:21:41| Knox County can be fondly remembered for having given impetus to the use of this kind of intelligent traffic control here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1301)|
| 0:21:51| It's not very expensive to install, and it produces tremendous benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1311)|
| 0:22:01| Thank you, Mr. Vanek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| Questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| Thank you for your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| I know you've called me, so I'm confident you'll probably be in touch with other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| Yes. The second issue, looking at the map of Knox County here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| back in September, I put a canoe in at the Cliff Road boat ramp in East Knox County on the Holston River| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1340)|
| 0:22:29| and canoed down to the Holston River Park just before the confluence with the French Broad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1349)|
| 0:22:36| 16 miles that I canoed that day, several hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1356)|
| 0:22:43| The whole time I was on that river, I only saw one or two other watercraft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1363)|
| 0:22:49| And this was a Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| It's a beautiful stretch of river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| It's a tremendous recreation resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| There's very poor access to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| You can get to it at the Cliff Road boat dock, and you can get to it at the Holston River Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1382)|
| 0:23:08| where 11E crosses the river just before John Sevier Highway on the east side of the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1388)|
| 0:23:17| There's a paved ramp that goes down to the water, but it's blocked off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| I want to ask, and I've left a message with Parks and Recreation about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| I want to ask that the county make a concerted effort to improve river access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1407)|
| 0:23:34| not just for the Holston, but also the French Broad and the Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| Thank you, Mr. Van Cleef.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| That will be given to the people in Parks and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| Next item on the agenda, I need a motion to accept the minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1429)|
| 0:23:57| Motion and second is properly made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| We are now into the items, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1443)|
| 0:24:10| We are now into the items of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| Moving to the front, the request of the Audit Committee for an audit of Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1453)|
| 0:24:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| This is a motion that was approved by the Audit Committee about an hour ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| The move that the Knox County Audit Committee recommend to Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| that the actions of the internal auditor in commencing a performance audit of Knox County Schools' credit card program be ratified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1474)|
| 0:24:41| and in proceeding with the audit, the extent and scope shall be developed by the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1481)|
| 0:24:47| Furthermore, move that should the internal auditor deem it necessary to conduct an audit of the Knox County Schools' purchasing program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1487)|
| 0:24:54| and its travel expenditures, that she be so authorized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1494)|
| 0:25:01| Mr. Chairman, I move for passage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| Motion before us to hear second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| Motion and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| Mr. Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| I guess there's two things in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| The first word is, and I'll ask the law director, could you define ratify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1519)|
| 0:25:25| It sounded like that motion asked us to ratify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| It's asking you to ratify our behavior or approve a behavior that's probably already taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1530)|
| 0:25:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| So is that going to hurt or harm us going forward with the behavior that's already taken place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1541)|
| 0:25:48| I just don't want that to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| So I don't want to get to where, well, you've ratified it, so we've ratified the behavior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1552)|
| 0:25:58| or the action that's probably already taken place, I want to say behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| How would that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| It only deals with this one action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| That's all that's before this body, and the motion is, you know, it's on its face what it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| and you all can discuss it and deal with it as you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| And then the second question, I don't know, I guess it's to the members of commission that were here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1577)|
| 0:26:24| and it was read fairly quickly, so the issue with travel, could you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1584)|
| 0:26:32| I just heard the word, Commissioner Brown, could you read that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| Further move that should the internal auditor deem it necessary to conduct an audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| of the Knox County Schools purchasing program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| and its travel expenditures that should be so authorized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| Let me explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| So my question, just the purchasing, I agree, I'm trying to understand how you all got the travel as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1611)|
| 0:26:58| So what's happening with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| What we're trying to get away from is the confusion we had at last month's commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1620)|
| 0:27:10| When it was voted that it had to go back to the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| to be able to allow our auditor to start work when in truth it did not have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1634)|
| 0:27:23| As I said, the buck stops here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| We can authorize it any time we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| This gives her some leeway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| and it also says in effect that three months from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1652)|
| 0:27:39| if she finds a problem in whatever department you want to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1659)|
| 0:27:47| and it's deemed to be of significance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| that she has the authority to go ahead and start checking into it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1673)|
| 0:28:01| And this is a good time, I guess, as any, Charles, to bring this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| But he's going to read you the code in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| But just to remind you that September 11th was when the nutrition supervisor was placed on leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1689)|
| 0:28:23| We did not hear about it, get an official notification until September 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1703)|
| 0:28:30| And Charles has the code here, if you want to read that, Charles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| what it says and what the obligation of the school board is in case something does come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1715)|
| 0:28:42| Okay. Let us pause for just a second at this point in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| Commissioner McKenzie was asking a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| So the first question was, was that answered by the law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| It was, and I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| And then the second question was about the scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| And I think that having sat through that discussion, we first started out saying credit card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| and it was like the scope was going to be directed only at six credit cards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1746)|
| 0:29:12| as the Board of Education requested for a five-year period forensic audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1752)|
| 0:29:20| We were advised maybe that's a little bit too long a window, unless something comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1760)|
| 0:29:25| and that we should maybe just look at two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| I think that's what's in your motion, right, two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| And it may be that something may be found that maybe leads a thread to some other credit card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1770)|
| 0:29:38| And we said credit card, I guess, at the occurrence of this could be like a fuel card| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1778)|
| 0:29:45| or any other instrument that is used in lieu of cash that then gets charged back against the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1785)|
| 0:29:53| I believe that's why it sort of went too long in trying to describe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| It's more than just the six credit cards if the six credit cards leads us in a direction, and not us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| if it leads the auditor in a direction of some other thread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| So I guess my question is, wouldn't that be done without the additional words?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1808)|
| 0:30:18| My concern is that we're giving Andrea too big of a scope, and we won't get back what we're after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1818)|
| 0:30:31| If we say credit cards, that has tentacles that can go everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| If we keep that in a box, so that to me is, this is the first I've heard of credit cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| I guess during the discussion it's the first that credit cards have come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| the first time that credit cards have come up, not non-PCARD credit cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| And I do understand the logic behind it, but if we just open it up to credit cards, again, I'll be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1849)|
| 0:31:00| My fear, my concern is that we end up going in directions that could be counterproductive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1860)|
| 0:31:12| but more importantly are not utilizing a limited resource, a very valuable but extremely limited resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1872)|
| 0:31:22| So that's my primary concern, and with the wording that I heard just now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1882)|
| 0:31:29| And not to draw it out, I think that commission, as we're facing the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1889)|
| 0:31:41| we don't need to be back and authorizing her sentence by sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| which is what we sort of got ourselves into with the nutrition program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| We may have too broad a scope, but we may be better off with a broad scope than a narrow scope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1909)|
| 0:31:57| in that the external auditor has said that this needs to happen as it is found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| and keep the ball rolling rather than coming back to commission to make sure that we're on the right track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1923)|
| 0:32:11| And I would be comfortable with those words, auditing the PCARD situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1931)|
| 0:32:18| however you phrase it, and other ancillary things as they are found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| I'm fine if she gets the thread or whoever the auditor, he or she gets the thread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| They need to run that to ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| But if we just put a category in, credit cards, then that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| Well, it says the extent and scope shall be developed by the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| So as she finds something, she has carte blanche to dig it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1961)|
| 0:32:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| Now, while we're paused, there has been a significant question come in my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1968)|
| 0:32:55| of the extent to which we commission, we authorizing this audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1975)|
| 0:33:08| we need to make sure that we do not compromise something that may come up of a legal nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| So at this particular point in time, I need to ask for a comment from Butch Bryant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| Would you give your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| My name is Carlton Butch Bryant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| I'm with the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| I'm an attorney for the sheriff as well as a certified police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| I'm actively involved in the investigation that you all are talking about right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2011)|
| 0:33:39| We are in the process, we are working with the state comptroller's office who will be doing a forensic audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2019)|
| 0:33:47| We are also working with the school's investigator as we learn various facts in this investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2027)|
| 0:33:59| And I think it's just important that you all know that there is a pending criminal investigation into this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2039)|
| 0:34:06| The state comptroller's office is doing a forensic examination of these records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2046)|
| 0:34:13| And one of the things I heard Commissioner McKenzie say was limited resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| And I just want you all to know that we are very actively investigating this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2059)|
| 0:34:29| So does anyone have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| That's the reason I wanted this brought to the front because our external auditor is also still here in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2072)|
| 0:34:38| And by the way, we are working with the external auditor also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| We're providing the external auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| I just got off the phone with one of the external auditors earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| We are providing them documentation as we uncover it as they need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2088)|
| 0:34:55| Are there other questions of Mr. Bryant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| Roy, I don't know if you've heard our dialogue about the performance audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2101)|
| 0:35:07| Is that similar to what you think you're getting at with you all and the comptroller?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2107)|
| 0:35:14| Commissioner, when you say performance audit, what do you mean by that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| We had a long conversation about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| And I guess Andrea can get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| You get into the finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| Are you just dealing with the criminal aspects of the audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| or are you dealing with the operational aspects of the nutrition department, which could be out of compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2130)|
| 0:35:38| Unfortunately, in the investigation, we are dealing with, you know, we are limited to the criminal investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| but we are going through the operational portion of the nutrition's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2144)|
| 0:35:51| I'm aware, and we have information with regard to both the credit cards that you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2151)|
| 0:36:01| and I heard somebody make reference to fleet cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| We're aware of all of that, and we're investigating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| I've got those records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| So are you working with the internal auditor also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| I have not had any conversations with the internal auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| but I have no problem with working with the internal auditor to the extent that we can with regard to criminal investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2176)|
| 0:36:25| Well, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| I think where we are right now is that we have been made aware that there is an ongoing criminal investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2187)|
| 0:36:35| and that we need to respect those lines and not compromise the criminal investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2195)|
| 0:36:45| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| That's why I think that he should be in contact with our internal auditor so that they can define their parameters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2206)|
| 0:36:53| and if he finds anything that she needs to know about, you know, he can pass that along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| and she might find something that he needs to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| I mean, there's no reason they can't work independently and together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| Right, because as Commissioner McKenzie made the point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| there's a difference here between the criminal investigation and Commissioner McKenzie's words, performance audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2230)|
| 0:37:17| meaning are the books balanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2237)|
| 0:37:25| It still doesn't preclude them from working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| Right, and now that we're getting to the point of there is an ongoing criminal investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2247)|
| 0:37:34| and you did say of two separate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| One is a nutrition program, and one is the usage of credit cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| You have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| Well, I think the nutrition program includes the credit cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2263)|
| 0:37:51| I'm not going to comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| What's facing commission is that there are two separate individuals involved in the two separate instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2273)|
| 0:38:00| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| Okay, and you have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| It's been made public, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| Okay, and then you may have other things that you may find,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| which that then bears up me saying again we do not want to compromise the investigation of law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2288)|
| 0:38:17| And that is part of my concern and why I'm before commission today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| The stuff that we gather for the criminal investigation, once it's complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2302)|
| 0:38:28| will, of course, be available to anybody under the Open Records Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| and I question whether we're going to be duplicating work that we have been very actively involved in since mid-September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2313)|
| 0:38:44| Are there any other specific questions at this time for Mr. Bryant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2324)|
| 0:38:52| No, not for Mr. Bryant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| There are lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| I was looking for a show of hands if someone had particular questions for Mr. Bryant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2334)|
| 0:39:01| I'm not seeing any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| Thank you, sir, but please make yourself available here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2342)|
| 0:39:10| I believe Commissioner Busler had the next floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| Well, this is sort of like a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| I was here at your meeting here, and what I heard the external auditor direct our auditor was in saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2355)|
| 0:39:25| if she's auditing and she finds another little stream that she needed to go down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2365)|
| 0:39:31| that she wouldn't have to come back to us for more guidance, and that's why it was left so broad in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2371)|
| 0:39:38| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| So we were advised by an external auditor this is the way it should be done, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| Commissioner Owenby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| Yeah, I was at the Audit Committee meeting too, not a voting member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| I wanted to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| And Mr. Pugh, he could probably clarify it for us if he needs to, but we were told that we needed to make it broad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2400)|
| 0:40:13| because you don't want her having to come back here because it takes away the element of surprise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| every time you have to come back here and get approval, just go there and look for another stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2418)|
| 0:40:24| From my understanding, Andrea is going to basically be looking at the processes and the policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2424)|
| 0:40:32| and what did they have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| I know they've already moved the credit cards and done away with those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2434)|
| 0:40:40| and they're on the county's credit card now system, but it's the other ones that we worry about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2440)|
| 0:40:46| It's the ones that, the gas cards, and are they being used properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| and are they filling up their own gas tanks with them and not county vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2449)|
| 0:40:56| The SAMS cards, from my understanding, there's 27 of those out there, and have they been used properly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2456)|
| 0:41:04| That's the whole point of this, and I don't think, from my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| is that Andrea is not going to be interfering with the criminal part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2468)|
| 0:41:15| It's just to go around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| I guess if she does find something, she will relay that to the pewing company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| as well as the sheriff's office as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| So she can correct me if I'm wrong on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2487)|
| 0:41:31| And she's coming down here, so I say I'm wrong on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2491)|
| 0:41:37| Give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| Andrea Addis, 1309 Woodland Ridge Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| I wasn't coming to say you're wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| I was just coming to give some context behind what are our rules about investigations and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| Under the Yellow Book, we are required to work with the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| and any other investigatory arms of the county to ensure that our audit doesn't interfere with their investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2516)|
| 0:42:03| We don't want to impede the process of what they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| because that's recovery or criminal or other charges that could be brought against individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2528)|
| 0:42:15| or departments or processes or whatever they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| We don't want to interfere with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| So as part of our audit process, we have those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| We've had them in the past to make sure that we weren't going to overstep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| or interfere with any kind of pending investigation or litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| It's not just an investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| There could be pending litigation against the county or that the county is going to put out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| So we do work very closely to make sure that those things don't happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| because that would diminish the value of the investigation or litigation, and we don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2561)|
| 0:42:48| And if we did find something that was potentially criminal in nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| we would have to turn it over at that point to the proper authorities for them to continue the investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2571)|
| 0:42:58| We don't have the subpoena power, all that stuff, to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| We want to make sure it got investigated properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| So those are our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| We cannot interfere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| We don't want to interfere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| We have to know what the parameters of the investigations are and how we can structure the audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| what information can and cannot be given out in the report that would interfere with the investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| That's all part of our audit process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| We're very careful about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| Okay, and that's what I understood from Chairman Anders' email that he sent out to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2602)|
| 0:43:28| when they discussed to go ahead and to start on this because of the nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2608)|
| 0:43:34| that you would be working with them if you did find anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| that we're not here to hinder their investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| We're actually here to help in any way we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| So thank you, Andrea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| We have a motion on the floor that is to proceed with an internal audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2631)|
| 0:43:58| And speaking to the concerns about impeding an investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2638)|
| 0:44:04| the guidelines of the book by which she operates has that included in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2644)|
| 0:44:11| So we can either add it to your motion if you wish, or we can leave it the way it stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| The motion that's before us is a good motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| What do you want to add, did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| No, I don't think there's anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| We could have added do not impede or compromise an ongoing criminal investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| Well, I think that stands as the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| That stands in what she just said out of the yellow book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| So do we have further discussion about the motion as it stands before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| We had this discussion earlier with the law director and deputy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2680)|
| 0:44:48| that this technically sets the precedent for future ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2688)|
| 0:44:56| that we do not have to do each one of these this way in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2696)|
| 0:45:04| In other words, as I said a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| if something comes up in six months and she finds it in the XYZ department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| somebody reports it, she doesn't have to wait until it comes before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| If it's of significance, she doesn't have to wait to come before the audit committee or commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| She can start in on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| Passing this authorizes future ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2724)|
| 0:45:35| Is there further discussion on the motion that's before us, Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2735)|
| 0:45:40| I guess I'm going to have to ask, because I don't agree with anything Commissioner Brown just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| and I don't think anything that he read binds us to allow her or whoever her successors are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2745)|
| 0:45:54| to audit anything that they choose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| That's my issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| That's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| It's not this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| We're going to audit this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| What I don't want is for us to just start willy-nilly calling out audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2764)|
| 0:46:10| I don't like the fact that Commissioner Norman took the job with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| so should I take that department and push her to audit them because they found $28,000 to pay him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2773)|
| 0:46:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| That's not my scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| That's not what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| That's not the point and the purpose of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| So if we're going to pass a resolution as spoken, even today, I know we'll see it next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2788)|
| 0:46:37| but if we're going to do it as spoken, we're not doing our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| We are the body that drives the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2801)|
| 0:46:47| We're the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| We need to drive the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| We need to, when I say drive the Audit Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| drive the internal auditor based on recommendations from that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2813)|
| 0:46:59| We can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| And hopefully, I didn't read any of what Commissioner Brown said into that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2822)|
| 0:47:09| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| What was the motion that was before us was to implement an internal audit of credit vehicles, devices of credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2830)|
| 0:47:22| It does not modify or amend any of the processes or procedures of Knox County as relates to the commission or the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2842)|
| 0:47:36| Other than what's specifically in this motion about this audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| All audits will stand on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| So could I introduce a substitute motion that we send this on without comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2865)|
| 0:47:54| Okay, recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| Recommendation, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| Yes, this is a substitute motion so that we can see it in print and vote on it on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2877)|
| 0:48:03| Okay, substitute motion before us to hear a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2883)|
| 0:48:08| That the item be sent to full commission, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2888)|
| 0:48:17| The motion dies for the lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| It will be pulled off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| Oh, I would definitely pull it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2903)|
| 0:48:30| Charlie Bessler, did you have a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| Excuse me, Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| I just wanted a clarification here that what we were voting on or what was added to that was on if we call for a special audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2916)|
| 0:48:47| like we've just done, that this would open it to where if the internal auditor, whoever it may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2927)|
| 0:48:56| if they find something else when they're looking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| that they have to come back to us for additional guidance if they find something different or in addition to what is being audited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2940)|
| 0:49:09| Is that what was being said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| What is happening on this audit of the credit card devices, vehicles, whatever, of the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2951)|
| 0:49:23| if there is credible need to continue the audit in other directions, that will occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2963)|
| 0:49:29| And that occurs in this audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| But it does not affect or bind us to any other type?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| Not in any future audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| All audits stand on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| Motion is before us properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=2981)|

| 0:50:20| Move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3020)|

| 0:52:54| Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3179)|
| 0:53:04| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3184)|
| 0:53:11| Page 10, item number 34, Ordinance O-14-11-101, is amending Knotts County Code, Chapter 46, Article 2, relative to the Library Advisory Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3191)|

| 0:53:46| and number three, replace Board of Public Library Directors with Library Advisory Board in Chapter 46, Article 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3226)|

| 0:54:06| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3246)|
| 0:54:11| This is a reading of an ordinance which takes two readings to pass and a public hearing to be held in between the first and second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3251)|
| 0:54:22| I believe that it will just be passed to full commission for first reading Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3262)|
| 0:54:37| Properly before us for the Monday commission meeting, all in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3277)|
| 0:54:43| Any opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3283)|

| 0:55:06| Item 38 is on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3306)|
| 0:55:10| Oh, that's Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| That will be moved to the Monday meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| Is there anyone here to address Item 38 on the regular agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3316)|
| 0:55:23| That will be moved to Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3323)|
| 0:55:40| The next item is Resolution 905, which was added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| It is approving an agreement with the City of Knoxville to receive funds in the amount of $53,546 for compliance officer position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3344)|
| 0:55:56| within the Knotts County Criminal Court Clerk's Office as part of the City of Knoxville's grant award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3356)|
| 0:56:04| to encourage arrest policies and enforcement of protection orders program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| No local match required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| Clerk of Courts, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3373)|
| 0:56:14| This is federal money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| It's a grant that was obtained by the City Police Chief and also our Knox County Sheriff from the Department of Justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3375)|
| 0:56:21| It basically would fund an individual for a limited amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3381)|
| 0:56:25| And not only do they fund their salary, but they also fund a computer, computer software, and a printer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3385)|
| 0:56:32| And this individual will operate out of the Fourth Circuit Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| Their primary responsibility will be to ensure that those who, the offenders who are involved in domestic violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3395)|
| 0:56:43| sexual assault, dating violence, orders of protection, stalking, that type of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3403)|
| 0:56:49| the compliance officer will make sure that they attend their court dates, they pay their fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| and that they attend court-mandated programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| It's my understanding that this is a first of its type in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| So, in a way, I guess people will be watching to see how well it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| And if it works, then they may expand it to other jurisdictions across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3424)|
| 0:57:09| But I also want to say that it's been made very clear that if, indeed, the funding goes away after two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3429)|
| 0:57:15| that we are under no obligation to fund this program after two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| So it is federal money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| There is no local tax dollars or any local fee money that will be associated with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| Did I hear a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| Make a motion. We approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| It's been properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| Is there any discussion, Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| Any questions of Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3459)|

| 0:57:55| I fell off the bandwagon when I didn't get a motion in front of his excellent speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| We have a motion before us properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3480)|

| 0:58:29| Someone will, and this is a board appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| Is that correct, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3513)|
| 0:58:34| The law director has informed me that this is a commission appointment to the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3514)|
| 0:58:41| That discussion needs to be held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3521)|
| 0:58:47| We need a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3527)|

| 1:00:25| I'm sure that will involve a couple of public meetings and the action of commission over a two-meeting period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3625)|
| 1:00:35| so we need to be prepared to discuss that Monday at full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141110?start=3635)|
