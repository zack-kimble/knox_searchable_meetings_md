| 0:07:40| abandoned vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=460)|

| 0:08:00| And, Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| before I end my report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| I've asked Peter Ahrens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| if he would give us a report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| on what has transpired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| since we passed the sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| about six months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| So, Peter, I'm going to turn this over to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| and we appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| Thank you, Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| I've provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| each of you a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| Well, I'll start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| We have created a database| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| of potential signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| that were abandoned. The database is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| created via email from citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| in scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| We'll go through that database| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| two signs at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| and we'll evaluate them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| to see if they are indeed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| abandoned. If they are, we follow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| with the property owner, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| first page of the sheet that you've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| given are the six signs that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| successfully had removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| We are also dealing with a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| temporary sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| complaints, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| actually we've had 119 complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| since the adoption of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| The second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| and third pages are typical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| examples of temporary signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| that we get a lot of complaints about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| Two of those we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| actually had to go to court over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| so it's not as simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| as we sometimes think or like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| But in addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| to the abandoned signs, I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| put a plug in for the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| staff. We have issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| over 345 sign permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| since the adoption, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| on top of signs, we're averaging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| about nine zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| inspections per day, which are on top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| of the work that they're doing with signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| Are there any questions? George?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| Thank you, Peter, for bringing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| Would you say that those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| complaints that you've gotten, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| normal? Is that far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| Is that greater? What have you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| seen there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| We've gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| 100-and-some-odd complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| From the previous six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| was that similar? It's about average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| I think that the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| is starting to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| a bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| action on the complaints now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| We're getting a more positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| result and more positive feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| citizenry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| Let's say that again. So you're getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| positive feedback? Well, the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| that are complaining know that we're actually following up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| Have you heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| what's been the public feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| when they come in to apply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| What have you heard on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| Those that are coming in generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| want a sign, and they're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| thrilled with the new regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| but they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| pretty straightforward, and once they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| this is the new law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| we help work them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| through any issues that may arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| Have you seen the same number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=664)|

| 0:11:24| decision in trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=684)|

| 0:15:02| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| Mr. Dellavopi. Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| Mr. Green, maybe you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| can tell us just a bit about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| 1,000-foot rule in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| of trying to spread out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| these services so they're not all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| clustered in an area and whether that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| affects alternate sides of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| In other words, how would that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| That rule would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| affect both sides of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| It would be measured from the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| line of the property on which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| an existing alternative financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| services facility is located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| to the property line of the proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| So it would basically be a radius| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| from that 1,000-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| radius from that property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| If they can't intersect, they've got to be that far apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| That would not affect existing businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| It would not affect existing businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| It would make some of those existing businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| non-conforming and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| they would not meet the separation requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| And if they were abandoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| for more than six months, they could not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| return to that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| Otherwise, it would not impact them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| So if there is a discontinuation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| then they could lose that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| non-conforming status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| If they discontinued for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| Gerald, we're sending this back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| for you all to craft the ordinance, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| Yes, sir. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| And you're going to be basing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| you've got some other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| that you're basing that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| apply this, right? That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| In the initial report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| that MPC staff did and provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| to council, we looked at Memphis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| Chattanooga, and Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| And those three cities have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| variation in the spacing requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| Some of them require up to a quarter mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| and 1,350 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| from an existing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| Some have varying standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| from existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| alternative financial services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| and from residential businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| We'll look at all those and craft one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| that meshes with our existing ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| whether there are distance requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| or separation requirements for other uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| So will it be applicable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| to other businesses or just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| On this one, just alternative financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| But could it be applied to other businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| as well? It could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| That separation requirement could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| one I'm most familiar with is adult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| businesses, the separation requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| for adult businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| We don't have anything like that now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| So we could apply that to other businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| by ordinance, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| So if an existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| financial services business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| as described in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| wants to go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| a new business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| wants to go in up against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| an existing business, there are two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| that are non-conforming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| but a third one wants to go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| the third one's got to meet the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| separation requirement. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| understand what we're trying to get to on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| but I think there's a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| of overreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| I throw caution to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| that a number of the properties that I've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| went from vacant property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| went from nearly blighted property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| to an improved property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| and the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| owners won,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| the streetscape won| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| they're legitimate businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| where some of the businesses we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| attract illicit activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| where I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| believe, even though I may not use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| the services of these businesses, I'm not sure they drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| I don't have any data that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| attract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| illicit businesses, other business, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| Or illegal business or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| They're trashy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| And there are a lot of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| that we could determine that they're trashy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| I think there needs to be some caution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| and I guess when this ordinance comes back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| we'll discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| That's a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| that's a waiting one and it's one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| that this council will have to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| We can just follow the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| directions of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| Councilman Pavley. Yeah, and I certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| intend to see it through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| the alternative is to do nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| and I think that that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| I mean, I've heard from a lot of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| to this city and our constituencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| I mean, I've heard from a lot of people in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| how these businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| have just all of a sudden just consumed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| a lot of our thoroughfares| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| and you see them not only in the first district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| down Chapman Highway, but you see them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| down Broadway, Southerland, Kingston, Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| Chapman, Clinton Highway, everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| And I think it sends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| a bad signal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| to the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| And I think it's also harmful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| It can be harmful to people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| would go into one store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| and go right next door to pay off the debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| from the original store and then the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| store's right there. It just makes it so easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| for this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| And it can, you know, ruin families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| People can lose homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| I think this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| should take action on it and not just let it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| be swept underneath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| the rug. If there's at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| illegal activities going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| we've got a police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| We've got TBI. We've got all kind of law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| enforcement. So if there's something illegal going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| those people need to handle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| you know, law enforcement needs to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| I don't put it in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| same, they are legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| businesses and they're controlled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| We also do it on the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| I mean, we deal with it all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| It's requirements on the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| So this is nothing new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| You've got three other cities out there with precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| that has not been challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| And I'm not sure how long they've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| on the books, but I know that they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| been on at least two or three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| and there's not been any challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| to it. So I feel comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| in spearheading this and bringing it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| And I'm certainly going to see it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| to the end and hopefully council will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| supportive of this when it comes back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| in its final form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| Mr. Dellavopia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| Yes, well I haven't seen the language and we're just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| sending this on to MPC, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| I think that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| want to encourage healthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| commercial districts and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| groupings of these businesses tend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| to discourage other businesses from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| locating there. And I think we do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| long-term health of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| community a disservice if we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| put some controls on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| so that it doesn't overwhelm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| a business district or an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| Councilman Starr. Thank you. I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| want to thank Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| Pavlis for bringing it forward. I think it definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| makes sense and I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| well documented the predatory nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| of some of these institutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| and it's not healthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| for the customers and to have them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| clumped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| as you said so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| throughout the commercial corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| it's not healthy for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| our neighborhoods and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| commercial centers so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| I think looking into seeing what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| we can do is the right step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1340)|

| 0:23:08| Well, if not, I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| wanted to state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| $8 million. I hope that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| that group will use some minority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1394)|

| 0:23:18| this large amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| and I see that there's no one here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| so I can't ask them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1402)|

| 0:25:38| Business Access Corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1538)|

| 0:25:44| some improvements along Marion Street as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| well. Part of these improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| involved going back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| and looking at doing the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| that there was some roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| improvements that needed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| made at the culvert at Second Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| and also some business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| accesses along Demarin and also Val| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| Street as we looked at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| right-of-way services through there. So CEI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| services are part of that contract administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| And CEI is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| the inspection? Construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| engineering and inspection. Alright, but these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| guys will get all the bid documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| ready to go working with engineering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| That's correct. Right now they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| in the right-of-way stages. They have received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| the notice to proceed with right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| and after that they'll complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| the construction documents and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| hopefully get that out to bid. That timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| is construction timeline is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| spring 2007, so hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| we can get the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| wrapped up and out to bid before that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| with the construction. 2017?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| 2017. I was going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| we're going back here. Yeah, we don't want to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| to spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| The end game of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| this is to get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| sort of used area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| and maybe partly run down area back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| into commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| and industrial use that needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| Yes, that's the goal to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| a business corridor access that runs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| parallel to I-275. You know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| when it was put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| a lot of roads like Dameron was disconnected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| and Valley Street were disconnected. This would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| provide some opportunity to put some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| parcels together along that line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| and hopefully get some light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| industrial or small warehouses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| through that area there. Job creation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| job opportunities in those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| areas in North Knoxville. So instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| going out to a vacant field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| 20 miles out from the city, you could be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| in essence center city redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| The whole idea is to complement what's there with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| Cisco and also what's been improved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| in the Baxter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| hosting gases site. We'll be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| improve an access to that site as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| and also a left turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| going westbound into Marion Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| and also complement what he's done there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| at hosting gases. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1668)|

| 0:29:32| Jim, just tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| briefly. We're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| use sort of a collective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| group that already bids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1778)|

| 0:29:42| better prices for some purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| That's my rough understanding, but maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| you can explain it a little bit more to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1786)|

| 0:29:56| several cooperative purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| agreements. These are things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| with either national or regional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1800)|

| 0:30:06| competitively bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| process and then we can in turn piggyback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| on those contracts and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| hopefully save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| This one is specifically designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| for services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1816)|

| 0:30:20| of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1820)|

| 0:30:28| that's being implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| But it's a way of sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| collectively getting a better price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| This would be again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| kind of regional prices usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| in terms of purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| more volume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| the better the pricing, and then we just join| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| in with other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1844)|

| 0:30:58| 11A is a resolution authorizing the Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1858)|

| 0:31:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| I just want to make a comment that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| I was a bit skeptical when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| went into reading this and after reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| 100 plus pages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| it's very quite organized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| to a lot more detail than I ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| thought possible and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| but anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| I left after reading 100 pages plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| very impressed with the organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| and what you're bringing together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| and I can see now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| why a four year contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| was approvable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| I just want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| good job to the Mayor for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| Thank you Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| Thank you Chair. I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| I just want to say the city does a lot of great things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| but private individuals do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| really really important things for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| and I think there's some people here from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| Knoxville tonight and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| the Farmer's Market has just been huge for downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| bringing it back, bringing people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| down there every weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| 11 months a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| 13 months a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| anyway it's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| it's a lot of volunteers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| they do a tremendous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| job and it's great for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| so I think we should just all acknowledge that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| and I'm happy to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| All those in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1960)|

| 0:32:46| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| 11 A.D. is the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| authorizing the Mayor to execute all documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| necessary to apply for and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| awarded accept a let's play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1974)|

| 0:33:08| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| Second. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| All those in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| Does that conclude the regular? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| Council we now move into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| We have 10 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| Council you'll know that our ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| says that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| members may speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| or those people that have signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| can speak up to 5 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| each. We do have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| according to the ordinance, a 30 minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| However, I think that we should give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| everyone an opportunity to speak but we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| to have a motion to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| I would move that we suspend the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| and allow these citizens to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| Okay. All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| Is there any further discussion? I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| I would ask folks if you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| talk about this topic that the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| in front of you spoke about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| try to add to it and put new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| pieces in rather than just repeating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| the same information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| I'm not restricting anyone. I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| urging you to use the time so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| more information gets out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| Any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| All those in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| First on the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| we're not sure they've checked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| Shall we find out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| Xavier Presley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| Okay. Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| Did you mean to say Xavier Jenkins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| You're on the list but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| you're further down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| Mr. Murphy, if you will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| come to the podium and give us your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| We'll begin timing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| Mr. Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| Councilmen and women, I'm here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| tonight to talk about zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| Ronnie Collins of Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| Association and Lisa Starbuck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| of Scenic Knoxville are standing with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| in support of my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| Zoning is what controls the appearance of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| The ordinances tell us how far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| back houses should be from the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| what types of uses are permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| and where they're permitted, what advertising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| guidelines look like and what type of landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| Zoning and the company overlays, districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| and such, they shape the physical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| community that we live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| Our current zoning ordinance sets a very low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| standard for our community's appearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| There's no requirement to buffer a parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| from a street with some sort of a green space or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| landscaping. Often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| sidewalks aren't required and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| most of the areas of the city don't have any kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| of design guidelines that influence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| the physical look of these buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| You can look up and down some of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| streets and you can see the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| results of low barriers. You have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| commercial lots that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| are 100% covered with asphalt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| and structures with no plants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| grass or trees. Our own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| zoning code actually encourages this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| visual blight and then we invest a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| of tax money on all the different corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| projects and improvements that we're doing around the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| Unfortunately, developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| routinely take advantage of the minimal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| standards in our zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| to maximize their own profit without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| bearing responsibility for the impact on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| the community's character and sense of place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| They follow the law and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| rules, but they don't have any skin in the game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| in our community to do what's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| Tonight I'm here with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| an example of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| Yesterday I copied all of you on a letter that I sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| to a local developer, Shod Brown Real Estate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| which is building a store next to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| Murphy Springs Farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| out on Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| They're using their basic store design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| metal and concrete stuff on the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| metal on the remaining three sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| minimal landscaping and pole signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| This store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| it's an example of how our zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| ordinance fails our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| The national chain dictates which store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| design will be used based on the local requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| Since the requirements in the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| ordinance are minimal, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| Dollar General signs a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| with the local developer requiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| their low income or their low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| end design with the cheap looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| exterior and minimal landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| The local development partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| who cares,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| they're caught between contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| terms and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| As the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| discussions goes, this one should have been a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| slam dunk. We're not opposing the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| We're not fighting a zoning battle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| This developer and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| chain have done stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| with enhanced appearances, same ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| we're requesting in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| but they require a use on review or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| a rezoning to force them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| do this higher level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| The local developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| he's from a family that cares and has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| in the community a long time. They generously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| support the organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| We've even put together a petition that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| over 920 supporters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| and about 311| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| people that have cared to comment on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| the design of the store and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| community. Their comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| which I sent to you yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| reflect that they're fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| with the use, but they want it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| to look better. They want to represent their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| Unfortunately, it doesn't look like we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| going to get these enhancements. All we've been told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| is they'll do a little bit of additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| landscaping, but they're not going to do a brick facade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| They're not going to change their signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| The developer hasn't been engaging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| with the community. I've only managed to talk to him on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| phone once since November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| This zoning ordinance, it encourages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| this low end development happens all over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| the city and all over the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| Tonight, I'm here asking you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| take a hard look at our zoning ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| We need to revamp them to give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| a city that we want to live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| We want places that look like downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| Forth and Gill, Holston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| We can do that if we set a reasonable bar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| in our zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| It's easier to convince| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| a developer. It makes financial sense, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| It's easier to convince a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| to build something that looks good if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| know that their neighbor is also going to have to build something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| that looks good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| There's another reason to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| update our zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| It's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| It's a precious resource to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| Community leaders like Lisa and Ronnie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| and myself, we spend a lot of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| working on these things that should be simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| We'd much rather be working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| issues of homelessness, education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| building new businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| enhancing our parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| Tonight, I've been running a petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| for two weeks, getting all these signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| There's nothing that you can do as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| city council, but I would ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| that if you at least know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| Michael Shaw, Gene Brown, or anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| from Dollar General, give them a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| Ask them, and then support MPC if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| look forward to making some changes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| our zoning ordinance. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| Kevin, Ronnie, Lisa, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| Boyce McCall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2420)|
| 0:40:26| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2426)|
| 0:40:44| Welcome, and if you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| And you'll have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| I'm Boyce McCall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| I live at 4710 Washington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| Park, Knoxville. I'm a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| retired city police officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| left the city under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| some unusual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| just today got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| a letter from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| Pursuit Board that I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| trying to get for 21| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| years. The city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| has withheld this from me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| deals with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| a situation where as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| was terminated, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| I upheld| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| the oath of office that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| took under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| 1405. Each one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| us has taken this oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| Each one of us are supposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| abide by this oath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| and observe it, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| this pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| board took over my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| pension system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| and they took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| under consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| the, uh, what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| have here in my hand for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| a rapist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| was run through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| and was retired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| in the line of duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| I'm talking about a rapist police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| officer, and he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| used this letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| to terminate me from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| of Knoxville. The city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| owes me for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| my service. They've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| denied me, and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| going to court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| in the next three or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| four days, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| have to come here and ask you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| people to try to resolve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| this, and if you don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| to do it, then we shall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| file a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| civil service, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| file a change of court suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| Thank you for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| Mr. McCall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| apologize ahead of time if I don't pronounce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| his name correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| Rachel Wynoki?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| Wynoki? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| If you'll come and state your name and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| address, then you have five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| when you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2592)|
| 0:43:22| Hello, my name is Rachel Wynoki,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| 1605 Branson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| I attended a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| at the O'Connor Senior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| Center in regards to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| the facelift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| Magnolia Corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| improvement. I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| deeply disturbed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| the concept of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| spending upwards of $12 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| for the three different phases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| on what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| is being called by the city a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| facelift, which many of us consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| a whitewash. Am I right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| I've prepared something that I'm going to read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| and here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| I go. In the summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| of 2013, my life was pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| golden. I was living in a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| in Park Ridge and had a job as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| the Urban Youth Garden Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| at Tribe One on Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| Avenue. I was also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| a part of the downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| farmer's market, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| one day, I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| off script here just because Norrish was here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| tonight, and I felt I should add this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| I was trying to go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| to the square with my car to get my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| produce. Six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| large white police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| surrounded my car and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| insisted I was not a farmer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| because I didn't look like a farmer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| wouldn't let me on the square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| and had their hands on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| their holsters. I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| if you've ever had that happen to you, but it's a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| scary feeling. Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| I don't look like a farmer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| they told me. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| the cops surrounded my car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| and were radioing each other trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| figure out if there's a permit for someone to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| be a vendor. There is no permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| You have your car, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| drive on, and you get your produce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| And you leave, as long as you're off the square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| by three o'clock. I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| never again gone back to Vend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| at the downtown farmer's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| market because of the way that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| police treated me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| And Norrish-Knoxville did nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| about it. Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| Committee, I registered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| a complaint. I don't know if any of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| you up on stage have ever had to go through that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| but it's basically a waste of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| Back to my script.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| I was living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| on Magnolia. I was living on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| Woodbine Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| and I worked at Tribe One on Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| That same summer, I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| a victim of gentrification. My landlord| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| saw the tide turning and wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| to raise my rent by 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| And Miss Michelle Foster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| this is what's going to happen to people like me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| if your plan goes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| Legal aid assured me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| my case, I would win, and I should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| stay and fight. Now, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| don't know if anybody on the stage has ever had this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| happen to you when your landlord says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| after the sheriff comes to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| you the warrant, I'm putting your shit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| on the street. That's not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| good feeling. And legal aid assured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| me you will win this. And by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| a year to the day, I won| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| in court. I represented myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| in front of Judge Long, and I won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| So it was an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| illegal eviction, but I chose to leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| because I didn't want, in my landlord's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| words, my shit put on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| And that proceeded to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| put me into a four-year downward spiral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| of trying to find suitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| housing, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| is becoming harder when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| gentrification happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| So back to my script.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| When my landlord attempted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| illegally evict me to raise the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| rent to market value, again, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| is what's going to happen to a lot of people if this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| Magnolia Corridor project goes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| Ironically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| simultaneously, Tribe 1 was closing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| its doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| I was hoping in vain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| that the board of directors of Tribe 1 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| city officials would step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| in, but no one did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| Many of us went weeks without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| pay. Nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| happened. Tribe 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| closed its doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| Many felt that Tribe 1 was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| the heartbeat of the East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| Side. We had upwards of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| 50 children a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| in our after-school program. I'm going to repeat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| that. We had 50 children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| a day after school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| in our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| We also had the Freedom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| School in the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| I encourage people to look that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| Tribe 1 closed. No one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| stopped it. Four million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| barricades, to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| medians in the middle of Magnolia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| that could have saved Tribe 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| That could have saved Tribe 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| When you talk about gang violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| and you talk about saving our youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| you can't say that to me with a straight face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| and you let Tribe 1 close down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| You can't tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| that you care about me and my city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| when no one stepped in when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| Tribe 1 was in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| I just urge people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| to put the money where it's needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| and concrete barriers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| and shortening and narrowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| bike lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| that's not a good use of city funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| Gentrification displaces African| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| Americans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| and we don't want that. Or do we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| that? Do we want to displace a historically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| black community? Is that the goal here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| Because that's the end game that I see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| happening. Your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2916)|
| 0:48:44| Next we have Xavier Jenkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| You'll come to the podium and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| My name is Xavier Jenkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2932)|

| 0:49:00| 37917, probably a block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| away from the proposed project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| Beautification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| Your ideas of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| beautiful or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| your ideas are beautiful on the outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| but rotten to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| You see it as beautification, however| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| we see it as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| an attempt to whitewash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| and remove the beauty from the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| It kind of reminds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| me, and I'll probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| put this down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| it kind of reminds me of a movie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| I once saw, Shaka Zulu,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| and there's an omitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| scene from that movie where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| the British are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| talking with Shaka Zulu| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| and he's asking him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| for land, for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| colony, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| reluctantly they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| the conversation and he says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| what will you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| with the land? Will you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| move in and will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| Zulu and British| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| live together as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3004)|

| 0:50:08| live Zulu| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| British? And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| he avoided the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| the British commander, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| so we asked him again, he said, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| are we going to live British| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| Zulu, British Zulu| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| or are we going to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| Zulu British?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| That's my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3026)|

| 0:50:38| or are we going to continue to do the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| thing that we've already done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| The track record is proven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3046)|

| 0:50:56| if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| say that you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3060)|

| 0:51:54| even name those streets after those people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3114)|

| 0:54:10| nothing to do and nothing to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| there's going to be some phases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| that you're going to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| If you're in this room, this empty room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| with absolutely nothing, no way to get out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| no way for anyone to come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| you're going to go through five phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| The first phase is an emotional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| phase. You're going to cry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| You're going to scream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| You're going to shout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| Unfortunately, no one's going to stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| to hear your cry. No one's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| to come back to hand you any tissue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| The second phase is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| a reflection phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| You're going to question yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| You're going to ask, how did I get here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| Who am I? And where did I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| The third phase is an exhaustion phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| You're going to be very tired. You're going to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| yourself weak, fatigued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| and you're going to be lacking energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| and feeling very weary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| The fourth stage is going to be a depression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| stage. And in that stage, you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| to find yourself unhappy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| You're going to be sad, and you're going to feel hopeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| The fifth stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| is the realization stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| You'll realize that you are fully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| aware that something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| is a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| And then what happens over a period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| and over years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| after years, this is going to go over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| and over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| and over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| and over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| and over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| those phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| You're going to find yourself empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| these are the four elements that are left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| with your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| empty box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| You're going to kill hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| Your dreams are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| turn into nightmares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| You're going to lose your mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| there goes your body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| And in conclusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| I would like to file an order of protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| against the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| to save our culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| to save our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| and to save our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3374)|
| 0:56:26| Is Amelia Parker here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| If you're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| you'll come to the podium and state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| and your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| And you'll have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3396)|
| 0:56:44| Hi. My name is Amelia Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| Address 3306| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| Fairway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| And when I called in this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| I was told I would not have time to talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| so I didn't really prepare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| So you get my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| emotional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| sharings that I'm going to share tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| I grew up in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| I grew up in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| which should be considered the inner city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| but we don't call it the inner city, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| because it's predominantly white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| But I grew up right behind Kearns Bakery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| took field trips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| walking across Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| walking across the Gay Street Bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| But when I wanted to experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| black culture, I knew where I could go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| And that was Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| That's where I went to get my hair done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| That's where I went to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| found the Kumba Festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| other, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| types of entertainment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| after school programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| where I could learn, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| some African history that certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| wasn't taught in public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| schools in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| And then later I learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| it wasn't even really offered at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| University of Tennessee, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| But that's another thing. Let's focus on Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| And I've been following this redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| process a bit, but I haven't been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| engaged that much because I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| been involved in so many other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| But I wanted to make it to the meeting last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| And when I got there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| I was shocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| And the reason I was shocked is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| the plan that I saw presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| looked exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| like the plan that was presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| in the original proposal in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| So my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| what has been the purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| of a public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| process if none| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| of that input has been listened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| to, has been incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| into these plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| I've talked to others in my community who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| absolutely exhausted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| by this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| And by the lack of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| investment, not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| just clear investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| in their communities, but investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| that doesn't push them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| I mean, I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| that I'm not the only one who's been around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| Knoxville for 30-something years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| So y'all know what that area of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| Knoxville used to look like. And you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| what it looks like now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| So you've got to just, you know, let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| speak some truth tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| And what we're calling for is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| a redevelopment process that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| actually listens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| to the people who bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| ideas, their concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| what their priorities are for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| community. Just like we've heard from other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| people who've come up here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| and said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| we want good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| zoning policies that help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| create the Knoxville we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| want to see. We want the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| thing. We want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| to be able to carve out a space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| in this city that represents us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| That tells the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| history. So that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| it's not a secret that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| just shared among a few people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| but it's actually something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| the city has invested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| in teaching the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| Not just the black folks, but anybody who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| walks down Magnolia should know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| the rich history of that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| because this city has invested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| in it. Now, I know you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| haven't done it previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| I was at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| county commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| I learned that new school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| hasn't been invested in in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| community since the 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| Doesn't that make you sick to your stomach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| to hear that? It made me sick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| to my stomach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| And you see this little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| of anger that I have tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| Imagine the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| who are living through this every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| day, who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| no belief that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| will do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| But I just want y'all to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| we organize in Knoxville now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| So we're going to build some political power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| But tonight, we just want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| to bring it to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| And I hope that you're listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| because from what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| I've heard, what I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| witnessed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| none of the input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| from the community has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| incorporated into these plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| in seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| What have you been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| doing? What you've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| paying for this process to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| for seven years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| and you've done nothing that the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3686)|

| 1:01:30| And now tonight, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| talking about committing three to four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| million dollars to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| We have not considered anything that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| community has wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| or needed. All| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| you want to put money into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| is police for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| community. We need more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| We need more than that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| and we deserve more than that and quite honestly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| our tax dollars pay for it!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| We are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| asking, we are demanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| as citizens!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| We are citizens!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3720)|

| 1:02:12| David| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| Hayes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| David, if you'll come to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| and give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3740)|
| 1:02:28| Alright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| My name is David Hayes. I live in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| 241 Hawthorne Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| I have a simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| question for you all. That's not actually that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| It's what does systemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| racism look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| I have some ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| I think it looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| funding a police task force to further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| criminalize black youth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| in Knoxville. When black folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| in this city say time after time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| after time at community event after community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| event that school program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| after school program, mentoring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| community centers and actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| abolishing this corrupt criminal justice system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| in the first place are steps we can take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| to actually have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| safer streets, to actually have safer communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| and yet y'all still fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| this Knoxville Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| to go in these communities and criminalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| folks and put folks in jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| and increase the violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| actually. It looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| not even pretending to care about black lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| in this city unless Obama tweets about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| the death of one of our local heroes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| It looks like excluding black| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| from city contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| Mayor Brown, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| what I'm talking about. We expect you to step up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| in this certain instance and we expect you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| to come forward with some documents to help us move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| so we can actually remedy this problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| for black contractors being ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| It looks like being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| intimidated that folks might come and just call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| out injustice that this board continues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| and having three cops by the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| I've been to many meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| school board meetings and city council meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| and city council and county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| meetings and I haven't seen this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| But we aren't afraid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| We're still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| It looks like having a black church in your city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| attacked and almost burned down and staying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| quiet and ignoring the hate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| I'm glad that Marshall Henley's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| in the room right now. His church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| is actually, they tried to burn it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| and actually there were numerous churches all across the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| that was burned down and y'all stayed quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| Y'all stayed quiet. And y'all have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| an opportunity right now to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| a stand against systemic racism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| that this board often perpetuates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| The streetscape plan is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| not for any black folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| or any others who have historically lived in East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| Knoxville. The picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| of the streetscape plan, what it could be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| in case you haven't seen it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| it's a picture of all these white folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| riding their bikes around with Jasmine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| on Magnolia and only one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| black person in the picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| And this black person, everybody else is wearing shorts, but this black| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| person's wearing a coat and all this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| It's obviously just copy-pasted. It's crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| And that's indicative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| of what the type of community people want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| to see there, not the people living there want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| So you say you've taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| community input. Did you go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| door-to-door in neighborhoods in this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| Did you listen to the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| on the east side who proposed different plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| throughout the history of this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| Did you reach out to community leaders and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| ask them what they thought was needed in Magnolia?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| Did you consider that people don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| want to be part of downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| Did you think about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| My sister said a story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| about what happened in interactions he had downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| with police. Why would we want to incorporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| ourselves with downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| Did you think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| guaranteeing the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| currently in this area now that they won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| be pushed out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| What do you have set in place where people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| won't be priced out of their homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3942)|
| 1:05:44| What do you have in place? I don't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| anything. Did you talk to black business owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| and say, yo, how can we help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| you thrive with these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| millions of dollars we have to invest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| Regal Cinema got like, what, $12 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| Actually, $12 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| Almost like tens of millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| if you take in over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| how much money they're saving because of what this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| city offered them. Hundreds of millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| And we got businesses struggling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| out in East Knox. We have mentorship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| programs struggling. We have people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| trying to create community spaces and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| struggling out here. And y'all have this big budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| and y'all want to have a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| and the picture for this plan is all white folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| riding bikes. We know what that's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| We know what that's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| So I'll encourage you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| For this time, take a stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| Use some moral fiber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| I want to look at y'all in y'all's eyes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| when I say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| Don't go forward with this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| Think about the people in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160202?start=3996)|
