| 0:01:35| The chair will entertain a motion to approve the minutes of the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=95)|
| 0:01:39| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=101)|
| 0:01:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=103)|
| 0:01:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=104)|
| 0:01:45| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=105)|
| 0:01:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=107)|
| 0:01:50| The next item is are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=110)|
| 0:01:56| Any items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=120)|
| 0:02:02| Yes, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=122)|
| 0:02:04| I would like to postpone for two weeks ordinance on second reading 9A having to do with the public parks, OS1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=124)|
| 0:02:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| We have some other businesses we're going to be tending to on parks, and I think that now with what's on the agenda that we need to look at that before we look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=134)|
| 0:02:22| So if we could postpone that for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=142)|
| 0:02:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=145)|
| 0:02:32| I need the chair to entertain a motion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=152)|
| 0:02:36| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| I made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=161)|
| 0:02:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=163)|
| 0:02:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| I'd like to address the motion itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=165)|
| 0:02:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=168)|
| 0:02:50| I'm not sure whether you're telling us that we need to consider the other items first and then hear this and you just want to change the order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=170)|
| 0:02:58| or you simply want to put it off for two weeks to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| Is there an advantage to simply changing the order and addressing it last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| I'm going to refer to council, but if you'll notice this is a reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=185)|
| 0:03:09| Second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| Second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| And the others that we're dealing with are first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| So I'm not asking that we look at this in relation to the others tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| I'm waiting until they're all at second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| I see what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| That's the clarification I was looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| I know there's been a request for a postponement on the slope and hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=212)|
| 0:03:40| Oh, we didn't vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| I was moving ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| Let's vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=225)|
| 0:03:46| I know how meetings go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| We'll vote on councilman Dwayne Greaves' motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=230)|
| 0:03:56| That motion is on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=237)|
| 0:03:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| The ayes have it and so are it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| Now, councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| Yeah, we have a request, and I think there have been requests from folks on both sides of the issue on 12E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=248)|
| 0:04:14| which is the hillside and ridgetop protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| I think we have ‑‑ I'm going to make a motion to postpone this until February 3rd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| because I have a vague recollection that somebody said postpone it until February 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=262)|
| 0:04:27| We traditionally don't set workshops here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| It says 8th in this memo that we just were handed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| Well, we should probably postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=273)|
| 0:04:35| Is that a Tuesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=275)|
| 0:04:37| That would probably make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| Let's make it the 8th then, because the 3rd is a workshop, so it would be the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| I've been here before, haven't I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| We don't usually include having workshops on our motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=286)|
| 0:04:53| Usually that's done sort of polling council, et cetera, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| but there also has been a request for a workshop on this issue, which we can pick up later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| or you all can pick up later, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| So motion to postpone it until February 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| The ayes have it and so are it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| Mr. Mayor, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| Yes, Mr. Dellivoki.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| I wonder if we have people in the audience that came to hear this, and I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| They may want to stay later and talk about it, but they may want to come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| and I don't know if we should check and see by show of hands whether there are people out there that have signed up for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=329)|
| 0:05:35| Do you have a couple?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| I think we have a couple of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| Arthur Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| If you would come down and give your name and address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| Arthur G. Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| Mr. Mayor, members of council, I signed up, along with Scott Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| simply to request a postponement of this and hopefully a discussion at a city council workshop on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=358)|
| 0:06:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| So we got the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| Is there anyone else wanting to speak on that matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| Mr. Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| Following up on Mr. DellaVolpe's suggestion, just a show of hands, are there any people, just are they here on that issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=378)|
| 0:06:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| That's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| Is there anyone else here that wanted to speak on that particular issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| If you could just raise your hand if you're in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=390)|
| 0:06:35| Seeing no hands raised, I assume no one is here to speak on that other than Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| And we've already passed that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| Are there any consent items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=409)|
| 0:06:55| Mr. Mayor, before consent, I have an item to be added by motion, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=415)|
| 0:07:01| I would like to add item 11D to the agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=421)|
| 0:07:07| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| And, Mr. Pavlis, if you have 11D, you might want to share it with the Vice Mayor at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=433)|
| 0:07:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| What could this be about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| We need to take a vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| Yes, Mr. Mayor, this is we'll let Vice Mayor in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| This is an honorary resolution for Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| Do we need a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=450)|
| 0:07:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| It's been moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| Can I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| Are we going to try and pass this on emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=454)|
| 0:07:39| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| I think, Mr. Pavlis, did you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| At the proper time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=474)|
| 0:07:59| Now we have the Mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| I have a few items to report on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| First is Martin Luther King events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| We are now at the time of the year where we celebrate Martin Luther King and his contributions to our nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=489)|
| 0:08:15| The MLK Commemoration Commission of Greater Knoxville has developed a series of events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=495)|
| 0:08:22| Tomorrow all are invited to the Interfaith Prayer Service, which will be held at noon at the Tabernacle Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=502)|
| 0:08:31| The MLK Memorial March Parade will be held on Monday, January the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=511)|
| 0:08:37| It will step off at the Tabernacle Baptist Church, which is located at 2137 Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard at 10 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=517)|
| 0:08:47| And you can find the schedule at the website, mlkknoxville.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=527)|
| 0:08:53| Also, we have the Dogwood Arts Brazilian Blooms Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| The city would like to recognize the success of the Dogwood Arts Festival Brazilian Blooms Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=538)|
| 0:09:04| which planted over 1,600 disease-resistant dogwood trees throughout our community this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=544)|
| 0:09:12| This is the second year of the Blooms Campaign with 2,000-plus dogwoods planted in just two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=552)|
| 0:09:20| Our Public Service Department and City Tree Board have been involved in supporting this program since the start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=560)|
| 0:09:27| Lisa Duncan from Dogwood Arts, I believe she's here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=567)|
| 0:09:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| And I would like to recognize her and all of the volunteers who are making Brazilian Blooms a success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=576)|
| 0:09:43| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| Let's give her a hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=584)|
| 0:09:51| The other item is the Brine Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| I would like to let council and the community know that the Public Service Department has implemented its Brine Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| for use in combating snow and ice throughout our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| And we've been having a lot of that lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| This is a new service which uses a saltwater liquid as a pre-storm treatment on roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| and is very effective in keeping the roads open and clear during short events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| The program also saves the city money during each event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| It is estimated that the implementation costs for this program will be recovered this winter alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=623)|
| 0:10:31| The entire program was built in-house by public service, fleet, and engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| and they are hosting an open house for the media and the council to see the new system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=635)|
| 0:10:43| That will be on January the 20th from 1030 to 12 at our Lorain Street Operations Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=643)|
| 0:10:54| Are there any reports of council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| I have two reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=661)|

| 0:11:06| the Westview community will hold a meeting at the Westview Wesleyan Church on Joyce Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| and this will concern Neighborhood Watch and some other reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| And on Tuesday, January the 18th at New Hope Presbyterian on Merchants Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=676)|

| 0:11:24| and at 7 p.m., the Homeowners Association will meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| and the homeowners will be talking about zoning and land use issues that affect the Norwood community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=687)|
| 0:11:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| On January 29th, I'll be letting all our neighborhood associations know in the second district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| that we're going to have a meet-the-council representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| And, Mr. Mayor, I'd like you to put that on your calendar, that we'd like to have you join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| That will be on Saturday, January 29th from 10 until 12, and I'll let you know where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=714)|
| 0:12:01| But we'd like for you to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| If what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=724)|
| 0:12:05| A.M.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| Oh, yes, that's A.M.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| I would just like to just briefly touch on the Henley Bridge closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| It has come and gone, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| I mean, it's been really a non-event, which is great news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| And I'm not just saying I know people are going, oh, he's crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| It is an event, but it's really not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| I mean, Steve King and I and John Hunter, we've spent an inordinate amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| standing on street corners in South Knoxville just watching the flow of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| And I really want to give my thanks, Steve, to you and to John both and Rick Emmett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=758)|
| 0:12:44| because, you know, we've worked through I don't know how many phone calls, e-mails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=764)|
| 0:12:50| and have really stayed in touch with the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| And thanks to Steve and pushing, well, not pushing, but just suggestions to TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=773)|
| 0:12:59| we got just about, I think, every recommendation that came from the business community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| and the community at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| We got things done for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| And it's made a huge difference to the business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| I spend at least an hour and a half, two hours on Saturdays going to the businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| knocking on their door, talking with them, and just seeing what it's like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| And, you know, it was very optimistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| They were very optimistic last Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| In spite of the fact that, you know, Knox County schools were still out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| We're coming off, obviously, you know, a major holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| And we had horrible weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| But their business just, you know, wasn't suffering as everyone was afraid of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=815)|
| 0:13:41| So, you know, I just want to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| You all are going to get so tired of hearing me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| But, you know, I just want to continue to please urge folks to not think that there's backups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| that there's not problems in South Knoxville, because there truly are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| Please, you know, visit our website at southknoxisopen.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| It will tell you a tremendous amount about the closure itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=840)|
| 0:14:05| but most importantly about the businesses, the unique businesses that are in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| Website links, if they have them, their phone numbers, addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| I just urge you to go to that site and continue to please remember that we're going to need, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| for everyone in the city to patronize the businesses that they have throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| It won't back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| It's not backed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| It's going good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| And we're open for business in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| So please continue to patronize those in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=870)|
| 0:14:37| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| I'll do a little vice mayor business first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| I want to let everybody know that on February 3rd there is a city council workshop on minority contracting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| That will be at 5 o'clock, I believe, in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| There will be a special called council meeting on Thursday, January 20th, at 5 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=894)|
| 0:15:01| to elect the replacement for the fifth district seat, which will be vacant come this Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=901)|
| 0:15:08| Anybody interested in applying has to apply in person up at the city council office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| Applications are due January 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| That gives a chance for all the information people have submitted to time to get out to everybody for the January 20th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=916)|
| 0:15:24| And I believe we will be replacing the vice mayor position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| or filling the vacant vice mayor position at the next city council meeting, January 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=928)|
| 0:15:34| I guess I'm going to say now to Mr. Swanson to remember to put that on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| And then just on a personal note, and I'll try not to be long-winded here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=939)|
| 0:15:44| I am known for being long-winded, and I'll try to avoid that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| I have handed in my resignation officially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| It will take effect 5 o'clock Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| I'll be moving on to be with family, as I think I've said a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=953)|
| 0:15:59| I wanted to actually say two things before I leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| I know there's a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| It might be another time to say it, but I'm going to say it now because I've got my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| I wanted to say just a word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| Everybody who's leaving is talking about pensions, and I'm going to do it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| Just sort of two thoughts about the pension situation we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| One, I just want to remind all of us that we all know that this is a great city because of the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=977)|
| 0:16:23| and how important they are for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| And I wanted also to say something to the employees, and, you know, there are a few of them here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| and a few I know have been active in employee associations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| that the city needs employee thinking on how to do this well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| We need creativity to solve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| This is an issue that can be a real zero-sum, you know, it's all about dollars and cents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| and it comes from here and it goes from there, and all I'm doing is trying to protect mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| We have to get beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| We've got to think creatively about how we do a system here to make it work for the employees that we value so much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1010)|
| 0:16:58| as well as for the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| So I wanted to, you know, parting words to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| And I just wanted to say to all my colleagues, the ones here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| especially the three that I've served with for almost seven and a half years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| and the ones in the past, how it's been an honor, and I'll miss you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| Before we go to 8A, I want to say something on behalf of the city and my fellow councilmen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1042)|
| 0:17:32| I want to express my condolences to the people of Tucson, Arizona,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1052)|
| 0:17:39| especially to the families of those who lost their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| And it reminds us that when you're in public service, or even not in public service, things can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1064)|
| 0:17:52| But certainly I want to express my condolences to the people of Tucson for that tragic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1072)|
| 0:17:58| and senseless situation that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| Ms. Mitchell, I guess we'll go to 8A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| 8A is a resolution confirming the reappointments of Jim Idle, Jeff Owenby, Sheila Witkey, Valerie Gillespie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1086)|
| 0:18:12| Louis Crosley, and Beth Waters to the Board of Directors of Community Television of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1098)|

| 0:19:02| Is there someone here that wanted to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| Mr. Regas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| Mr. Regas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1150)|
| 0:19:19| Mr. Mayor, if I might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| This is an absolute pleasure and joy on my part, and I have a hard time calling you Mr. Regas, so I'm going to call you Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1162)|
| 0:19:30| Just call me Bill, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| And I want to say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| First of all, Regas was our kind of neighborhood restaurant down on Emory Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| We moved down there in 1981, and I can't tell you how many lunches we've had, and it's always been the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1180)|
| 0:19:46| It's always been enjoyable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| I also want to tell a little story that growing up in Norris, this was back in the 50s, that coming to Regas was a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1188)|
| 0:19:56| You know, when you left Norris and you wanted to go to a restaurant for dinner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| and I always remember those special dinners that my dad would get in the car and drive over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1199)|
| 0:20:05| And, Bill, I can't believe that I remember the stools on the counter as the restaurant grew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| So I have a lot of fond memories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| The other thing I want to say is that when my daughters heard that the restaurant was closing, they both said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| What are we going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| Where are we going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| Because of all the birthdays and anniversaries and parties that we've celebrated there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| So you're going to be very, very much missed as far as the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| And I know your brother's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| He might want to stand up, and Greg is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| I'd like to read this resolution, if I might, so they may want to come forward also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| And I would like them to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| First of all, Duane and city council members and mayor, the Regas family thanks you for this recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1242)|
| 0:20:51| And I've had cousins that were in the business with me, Gus, Frank, and Charlie, that couldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1251)|
| 0:21:00| But I do have part of our team and family here that I want to have them stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1260)|
| 0:21:08| First of all, Grady Regas, my son, he's the one that wrote the Grady's restaurant plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1268)|
| 0:21:16| He's 23 years old, worked real well, and he's a consultant for Regas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1276)|
| 0:21:22| Grady, would you stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| And then next, Neal Kelly, who's our general manager the last three months at Regas, did a super job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1284)|
| 0:21:33| served 500 people on New Year's Eve and did a great job, Neal Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1293)|
| 0:21:40| Then my brother, George, just happened to be coming into Knoxville for three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1300)|
| 0:21:49| My sister's not good health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| He came to see her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| So I asked him to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| Brother George Regas, retired Episcopal minister, he had the largest Episcopal church west of the Mississippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1314)|
| 0:22:07| And I always tell people that because I'm kind of proud of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| George Regas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| He's retired now, but he gives me advice on the restaurant every now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| He says, you better do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| So thank you very much for this fine honor and recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1341)|
| 0:22:28| Before you finish, Councilman, I would like to invite each of you to come down to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| while Councilman Greaves reads that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1354)|
| 0:22:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1364)|

| 0:23:51| for residents throughout East Tennessee and beyond, serving as the place to go for special occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1431)|

| 0:26:14| Mr. Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| After that finale, I probably shouldn't even bring this back up, but I just wanted to remind the council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| and the public that the city has recognized the square down around Regas Restaurant as Regas Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1580)|
| 0:26:28| so we'll never really forget the Regases in the Regas Restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| And maybe, depending on what you do, if you redevelop it, maybe there will be another Regas Restaurant again there one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| But thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1600)|

| 0:26:45| We did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| Ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| Item 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into a contract with Vaughn & Melton Consulting Engineers, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| for the Jackson Avenue streetscapes and Upper Second Creek-slash-Old City Greenway project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1623)|
| 0:27:09| for a total project cost not to exceed $140,515, with the city's portion being 20 percent, or $28,103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1629)|
| 0:27:19| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| Mr. DelaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| Yeah, I wonder if I could ask Mr. King to answer a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| Steve, this is for the design services for this roughly half-mile, I guess, greenway and streetscape design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1648)|
| 0:27:39| As I read this, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| That's what we're doing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| Do we have some sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| I realize one of the things they're going to do is come up with detailed cost estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| Do we have some sense, the scope or general size of the overall project that we're sort of kicking off by doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1668)|
| 0:27:56| Let me first say this is a project that's funded through TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| It's called an HPP project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| We've had this funding for a few years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| It takes five years for this type of funding to accumulate where we're able to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1685)|
| 0:28:12| The intent is to connect a greenway from World's Fair Park to the Old City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1692)|
| 0:28:19| In conjunction with some other work that we're doing on the Jackson Avenue ramps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1699)|
| 0:28:24| we were able to convince TDOT that we change the scope of the limits of the project to the end of the Jackson Avenue ramp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1704)|
| 0:28:33| So we had the option of considering whether we'd take the greenway along Jackson Avenue or behind the southeast glass building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1713)|
| 0:28:41| And we have determined that we have been recommended that we place it along Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1721)|
| 0:28:48| The engineering department is working very closely with Bob Wetzel in policy development as we scope this project and move through design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1728)|
| 0:28:57| But we would anticipate that we would be able to install new sidewalk and street lights on one side of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1737)|
| 0:29:06| The south side, right, we're talking about doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| It's a very interesting project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| I just didn't know if, as I understood it, this was all of the engineering side of both design, prepare contract specs, and supervise construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1752)|
| 0:29:22| But I didn't know if we had some sense of the cost of actually physically implementing the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| the hardscape concrete type stuff that we're going to build as we go forward on that thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| I think our budget is approximately $600,000 or $700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| But as we get into this project and design it, you know, we may have to trim the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1780)|
| 0:29:48| or seek additional funds if we don't have enough to complete it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| But that's the ballpark we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| Well, thank you very much for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| Just as a matter of record, Steve, this was advertised and it was competitive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1799)|
| 0:30:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| There's a specific procedure on these type projects where we have to request letters of interest from consultants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1806)|
| 0:30:14| and we typically get a lot of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| The motion is on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| Ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into an agreement with the Davie Resource Group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| to conduct a tree inventory and assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| and to draft an urban forest management plan in an amount not to exceed $75,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1837)|
| 0:30:43| with the city's portion of the funding being $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| Yes, I just, if I might, Mr. Mayor, I was going to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| Mr. King, I have a nagging memory that we did something about a tree inventory not that long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| Is this a follow-up contract, or is this part of that, or am I just mistaken in my memory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| I don't have a specific reference for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| I think you probably are recalling the grant application that came before council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| We applied for a grant from the state forestry office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| In order to get to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| Thank you, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| This is actually a point of personal privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| As somebody who's chaired meetings with this particular council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| if you turn your chair a little to face that side of the audience, you'll notice the lights a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| You weren't pointing in this direction, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| There's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| 11D is a resolution honoring and recognizing the many contributions of Vice Mayor Bob Becker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1913)|
| 0:31:59| thanking him for his leadership and wishing him much continued success in all his future endeavors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| Before Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| I just want to say something about Bob Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| I've got to tell you one little quick story, and I can't mention the constituent's name because we all know him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1934)|
| 0:32:23| but this individual was having some problems, and he had a little bit of a language barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1943)|
| 0:32:31| And so Bob and I were over at his property, and he's very emotional and excitable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1951)|
| 0:32:39| and we were trying to talk to him about the issue, and he broke out into a different language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1959)|
| 0:32:46| and Bob was trying to calm him down, and the guy literally got up and was stomping around on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1966)|
| 0:32:52| and Bob was a lot taller than him, and he was kneeling, chasing him around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| trying to tell him to calm down, and the two of them were talking two completely different languages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| It's just that sort of compassion that he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| He was really putting his heart and soul in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| But one thing about Bob Becker is he probably knows the charter as well as anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| He used to bring it, and it was right here, and he knew I would watch him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| and there would be an issue, and he could turn right to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| And he did his homework, and he fought hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| He knows the rules, and he respects the traditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| and he's been a great advocate for those that he represented, and he just fought hard for his beliefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| And he's going to be somebody that's hard to fill his shoes, and we'll miss him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2015)|
| 0:33:42| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| I can remember when I first met Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| I think it was when I was at Comcast out at the paper mill office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| and you came down and wanted an appointment with me to discuss the living wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| And I think we sat in my office probably an hour and a half, two hours perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| and just couldn't really find common ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| But, you know, we did so civilly, and, you know, we were still friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2044)|
| 0:34:12| And even though we got where we needed to be on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| without having to do what we originally talked about with that, man, I was really proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2056)|
| 0:34:22| But, Bob, you've made a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| You know, I think after many years of a different kind of council, you led the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2064)|
| 0:34:32| You broke through the door to bring good discussion amongst the council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2072)|
| 0:34:38| a lot of harder work with workshops and real thoroughness that you brought to your seat and to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2078)|
| 0:34:47| You've made a tremendous difference in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| You truly have, and you'll be missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| And I appreciate and value why you made the decision that you did, but you can go with your head hung high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2093)|
| 0:35:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| Now, Councilman Becker, as a point of personal privilege,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| I would ask that you would come around this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| I have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| Let me go to Ms. Woodall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| Is that your right, Councilman Woodall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| Gosh, I'm not exactly sure what all to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2119)|
| 0:35:25| It's been a great honor to know you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| I mean, you know, you'll still be alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| I'm not dead yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| You're just a terrific example of a great council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2135)|
| 0:35:43| As a human being, you're kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| You're generous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| You actually look at the person that is talking to you and pay attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2147)|
| 0:35:56| You're self-aware enough to know and to ask for feedback, and you've asked me for feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2156)|
| 0:36:03| I love your style of being a council member because you're on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2163)|
| 0:36:10| You attend meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| You listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| You're not always looking for people who share your point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| but actually you're looking for people who can challenge your point of view because, in the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| it's not about everybody thinking the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| It's about building stronger relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| And so you get that and you work at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| Also, I mean, the books you read, I look at your bookshelf and I'm thinking, man, this brother is smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2188)|
| 0:36:35| I mean, no one reads Faulkner anymore, but there you have all this William Faulkner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| It's just really an honor, and I've grown as a person by walking alongside of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2199)|
| 0:36:45| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| Councilwoman Marotti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| Bob, as my favorite council member to argue with over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| you have brought a great deal of civility and respect and consensus building to your post,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2216)|
| 0:37:04| both as a councilman and later as a vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| And we are appreciative of your leadership and wish you Godspeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| And, Mayor, if it's all right with you, I'd like to take personal privilege and read the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2232)|
| 0:37:19| It is all right with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| Thank you, Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| If we could pass a resolution on emergency, I would amend this to emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| Sadly, resolutions are already effective upon passage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2248)|

| 0:39:25| And whereas, Vice Mayor Becker's outstanding leadership skills, sharp sense of humor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| and considered deliberative approach to the administration of council business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| will be missed as he moves on in a new phase of his life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| And whereas, the members of City Council wish to thank Vice Mayor Becker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| for his dedicated service and many accomplishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| during his terms as 5th District Council Member and as Vice Mayor of the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| to honor and recognize him for that service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| and to wish him all of the very best in his relocation to Richmond, Virginia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| and in all of his future endeavors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Council of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2401)|
| 0:40:06| that the Council of the City of Knoxville hereby officially wishes to honor and recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2406)|
| 0:40:11| Vice Mayor Bob Becker for his years of dedicated service to the City of Knoxville as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2411)|
| 0:40:16| and to this City Council in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| in the capacity of Council Member representing the 5th Councilmanic District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| and in the additional capacity of Vice Mayor of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| And to extend to Vice Mayor Becker Council's sincere gratitude for his leadership and friendship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2428)|

| 0:40:45| a true and correct copy of this resolution to Vice Mayor Bob Becker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| in order to make him aware of City Council's action with respect to this manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| This resolution shall take effect from and after its passage immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| The public welfare requesting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| Councilman Dela Vokey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| I hope this isn't anticlimactic, but I just wanted to thank Bob for, I think, his leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2465)|
| 0:41:11| He, as a newbie when we were coming on board, and even before we came on board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| Bob went out of his way to make sure that everyone got some information about orientation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2476)|
| 0:41:22| and helped us to understand some of the aspects of council that we would need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| And I think it reflects on his care and his concern and his dedication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| that he was always trying to make the process work, even when some of us didn't agree with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2492)|
| 0:41:39| He was always interested in seeing if the process would work and tried to be inclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| And I think that's an admirable effort, and we do appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| Bob, you have been a tremendous example to those of us who are relatively new and those veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2514)|
| 0:42:01| in how to use Robert's rules and procedures to the ultimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| And I think I have learned my lessons well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| You have frustrated me at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| I've applauded you at other times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| But I think that one of the legacies you will leave for this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| is that we have a better understanding of procedure and how to use it appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| And for that, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| And as I told you earlier, your decision to go with your family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| is probably the best decision you'll ever make in your whole life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| Bob, I'll just ditto what's already been said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| but also I do want to emphasize the fact that the decision you made, I admire you greatly for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| But also I want you to know I'm going to miss our coffees together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| And by the way, that was not deliberative coffee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| It was process-oriented, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| But anyway, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| Well, I'd like to say that I observed Bob Becker for some years before I came on this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2574)|
| 0:43:01| I saw him at community meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| and he's been a man that's been an advocate for some very just and worthy causes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2583)|
| 0:43:11| And I have appreciated serving with him this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2591)|
| 0:43:16| And before we vote on the resolution, I'm going to ask you to come around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| I'll try to get you around here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| If you would come around, I have something for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| Speech?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| No, we don't have time for speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| I guess let's just read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| Read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2619)|
| 0:43:40| It says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| The City of Knoxville's Certificate of Appreciation presented to Bob Becker, Vice Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| in recognition and gratitude for your steadfast leadership, friendship, and hard work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2627)|
| 0:43:54| you have performed for the citizens of the City of Knoxville as councilmen for the last seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| presented by His Honor, the Mayor, Bill Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| Bob Becker, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2646)|
| 0:44:28| Now I think we need to vote on the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| I'm sure there are no opposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| 12A is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B zoning regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| regarding changes to regulations in the OS-1 Open Space Preservation District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| First of all, I want to thank MPC for getting on top of this and presenting this back to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2699)|
| 0:45:06| but I do have a couple of questions, and again, Mark, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| On the OS-1, under the current text and proposed text,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2711)|
| 0:45:19| is there a reason that we have left houses and multifamily structures in the OS-1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2719)|
| 0:45:28| The reason for that is that the OS-1 has been historically applied to private property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2728)|
| 0:45:35| and there are numerous pieces of property owned by families and individuals that have houses on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2735)|
| 0:45:45| wherein they agreed to the open space zoning in exchange for having the right to continue to live on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2745)|
| 0:45:56| We didn't want to mess with the list of uses at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| but it is, I think, appropriate to keep them in place because this is a zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2760)|
| 0:46:06| that kind of creates an incentive for individuals to set aside open space while maintaining a development right on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2766)|
| 0:46:17| I know there are a couple of places that have the houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| but what about as far as multidwelling structures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| What's the real definition of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| And do we have a situation to date where there are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2788)|
| 0:46:33| I don't know the particulars on each and every instance of the use of OS-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2793)|
| 0:46:39| but a multidwelling structure would be an apartment or a condominium project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| If you could envision a piece of property of 100 acres, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| and an ownership group desires to set aside that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| they could still maintain the right to develop five of those acres under the current regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2814)|
| 0:47:00| the 5% factor for manmade structures and features, and develop that at 12 units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2820)|
| 0:47:09| So it is another way to create an incentive for property owners to set aside and conserve open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2829)|
| 0:47:21| I definitely like that idea in terms of how we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| Is there a way to take the houses aspect under there, under number 2.4.2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2845)|
| 0:47:34| and move it down to uses permitted on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| That certainly could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| The current zoning allows a house on a parcel of up to three acres, I believe it is, as a use by right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2861)|
| 0:47:49| and multidwelling structures as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| You have the authority to move those around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| I would like to, as far as this particular situation goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2883)|
| 0:48:09| I would like to move the houses down to uses permitted on review, if that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2889)|
| 0:48:16| Or I might ask legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2896)|
| 0:48:21| That would be a substantive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| I have to ask Mr. Donaldson if there was any consideration at all by the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2905)|
| 0:48:32| of putting that use in the uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2912)|
| 0:48:37| No, there wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| We wanted to keep the list of permitted and uses on review intact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| and addressed only the dimensional regulations and an exercise of cleaning up the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2923)|
| 0:48:52| And I fear the appropriate motion, B, would be to refer it back to MPC to consider making that move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2932)|
| 0:48:59| I'd rather not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| Is there a way to what I'm concerned about, again, of course, is the multifamily dwellings on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2944)|
| 0:49:18| Is there a way to, I noticed in the OS2 that that's not in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| And that's because of the distinction between properties where someone might be living on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2963)|
| 0:49:29| The purpose of the OS2 district is to regulate and protect active recreation land and facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2969)|
| 0:49:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| And we quite literally substituted recreation centers for houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| and other civic buildings for multi-dwelling structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| Yeah, I noticed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| So if you had a piece of property and it was zoned OS1 and it didn't have a house on it or multi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=2992)|
| 0:50:01| well, if it didn't, let's start with the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| If it didn't have a house on it, does this mean that they could build a house on that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3003)|
| 0:50:10| if they gave the property to the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| Yes, as long as they met the minimum lot size of three acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| and the maximum percentage of man-made features and structures of 5% of the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3017)|
| 0:50:26| and developed according to the other regulations, they could develop a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| But now as far as multifamily structures where that's a use permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| That process would be they would have to go to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| That would require development plan approval by the planning commission subject to appeals to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3040)|
| 0:50:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| Oh, no light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| Councilman Grieve, is that your light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| I'm sorry, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| There's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| What is this, the motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| You want to restate the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| The motion is to approve on First Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| The motion has been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| Ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| 12B is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B zoning regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3091)|

| 0:51:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| I just wanted to thank Mark Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| I know we went around and around on this in several meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| but it looks like you went back and acted on that idea of an active park zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3113)|
| 0:51:59| and we appreciate the work that went into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| So thank you again for bringing that back to us in that fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3122)|
| 0:52:08| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| I'd just like to echo Councilmember DellaVolpe's thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| I heard from a member of the Planning Commission today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| and she indicated that this was given all due consideration as speedily as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3137)|
| 0:52:23| possible both by the staff and by the Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| and we appreciate your prompt work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| I guess, Mark, I just want to echo the kudos you got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| It was turned around fast, and this is really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| I have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| It goes similar to what Mr. Greave asked before about housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| Houses are not permitted on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| and we have a couple parks that actually have a caretaker house on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| and I know there are provisions for accessory structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| and I'm wondering if somebody who's got a park comes in and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3176)|
| 0:53:01| I want to have a caretaker living there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| would it be your opinion that that would be an accessory structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| or is that something that would be prohibited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| It would be my opinion that that would be both an accessory use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| and an accessory structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| However, I don't get to make that call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| That would be a Gary Norman building official call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| but if asked my opinion, that's what it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3202)|
| 0:53:25| And at least we can say there's an argument to be made around that then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3205)|
| 0:53:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| Well, I appreciate that, because there is some level of that idea of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| parks having potentially somebody living there who's got the responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| for maintenance of it for some of the ongoing operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| I know we do a little bit of that now, and it works successfully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| and this doesn't preclude that possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| 12C is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| Zoning Regulations, Article V, Section 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| Minimum Off-Street Parking Access and Driveway Requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| regarding parking and driveways in the front yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| and the provision of accessible parking spaces and driveway and curb cut dimensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3249)|
| 0:54:15| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| There is one person signed up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| If you would come down and give your name and address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3263)|
| 0:54:30| Thank you, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| I'm Terry Faulkner, 4178 Ridgeway Lane, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3272)|
| 0:54:38| I want to welcome you as our mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| Tonight I'm speaking for the members of the Citywide Neighborhood Coalition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| who support this amendment, or these two amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| And we want to express our appreciation to those council members, past and present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| especially Barbara Pelow and Bob Becker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| who entrusted a citywide group of community leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| to work with the members of the city administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| to create a good and enforceable parking ordinance and then enacted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3305)|
| 0:55:11| And I want to add my kudos to Bob Becker, who could easily become a city planner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3311)|
| 0:55:17| Thank you, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| Because we sincerely appreciate these officials who were so respectful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| and considerate of the suggestions and opinions of neighborhood leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3323)|
| 0:55:29| and were so kind and helpful, I would like to thank them on record tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3329)|
| 0:55:35| And in engineering, I'd like to thank Steve King, and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| Brent Johnson and David McKinley, codes enforcement, Gary Norman, Anita Cash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3340)|
| 0:55:46| David Brace, and Robert Moyers were wonderful to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| All these people were wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| Members of the city law department, and especially Deputy Mayor Larry Martin and Bill Lyons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3353)|
| 0:55:59| who we're grateful to all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| Ms. Faulkner, I think I want to say right back at you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| because the work of that group was amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| We got together and we thought, we're trying to stop parking in front yards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| and we discovered that was easy until somebody said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| we have to say what a driveway can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| And I remember being upstairs in one of these meetings in the building here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3381)|
| 0:56:25| drawing on a board about how it would work on a corner lot and an angled lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| and a driveway, a hill and all this, and trying to figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| And I want to give an incredible thank you to you and Jamie and Charlotte| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3393)|
| 0:56:39| and the citizens who spent all that time on what really was some really fine details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3399)|
| 0:56:46| did some great thinking, and gave us, I think, a wonderful model for what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| So thank you very much, and we appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| Councilman Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| First of all, I apologize for asking these two questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| because I did mean to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| The snow kind of fouled us up yesterday so that I could get in touch with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| But I did have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| This is Article 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| It says, in addition to any of the above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| a branch-type turnaround not to exceed 200 square feet is permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| and then there's an omission, on any lot where city engineering standards can be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3437)|
| 0:57:23| So would you kind of explain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| Is that any lot within the city, any housing lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| And then what does it mean by where city engineering standards can be met?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| Well, the city engineering standards would be things like turning a radii| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3455)|
| 0:57:41| and a driveway located where there's appropriate sight distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| for a driver to get in and out of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| It's some general guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| And then the other question I had is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| has there been an update to the amount of parking spaces required for high schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3475)|
| 0:58:03| Is this an updated list on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| No, that hasn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| Are you finding that that's, in today's situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| is that really enough parking spaces for students and schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3494)|
| 0:58:19| Do you have problems with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| We really didn't evaluate that in this course of these revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| I think the reason those are there is because we did revise the van accessible spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3506)|
| 0:58:35| I was going to ask you about that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| This is according to ADA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| And I think that's the reason why you see the entire table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3520)|
| 0:58:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3529)|
| 0:58:50| There's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| 12D is an ordinance to change the street name of an unnamed street between Cherokee Trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| along existing driveway to Medical Center Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| University of Tennessee Medical Center Applicant First District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3546)|
| 0:59:11| I would like to move to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| And there's a representative here from UT Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| I know it's not been the council's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3557)|
| 0:59:22| generally we don't like something to be heard on emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| but I think that this gentleman can explain why it probably should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3567)|
| 0:59:32| I'm Dickie Hogan, 1929 Alcoa Highway, which is UT Medical Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3572)|
| 0:59:37| I'm the director of parking and security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| This came about about getting the street named because in the past year we've had two emergencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3579)|
| 0:59:45| where 911 was called, ambulances tried to respond because there was no name on this street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3585)|
| 0:59:51| There was a delay in getting there to give health care to someone in a back parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| and also in a back building that was off of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3596)|
| 1:00:02| So in the, you know, name of public safety, I would move that we approve it on an emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3602)|
| 1:00:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| Voting on the amendment now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| Was there a second on the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| I didn't hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3617)|

| 1:00:30| I just, there's, Rural Metro runs the ambulance service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3630)|
| 1:00:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| And I don't, I better not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| I'm going to make a joke and I shouldn't do that right at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| We're voting on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3646)|

| 1:01:06| Okay, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| It's already been moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3667)|

| 1:01:52| to light industrial for property located on the northeast side of Pelham Road, southwest side of Spring Hill Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3712)|
| 1:01:58| east of Rutledge Pike, 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| Yes, if I might, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| 12G, 12H, and 12I are kind of part of that family where we're looking at the sector plan, the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3728)|
| 1:02:16| and then the rezoning change from R2 to C6 on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| And I see that we have some people here to talk to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| This is obviously kind of a wonderful reuse of what was kind of a rock quarry that had been abandoned years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3745)|
| 1:02:34| and the owners have put heavy equipment there that they lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| but they have spent time and money in filling in that site, leveling it and compacting it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3757)|
| 1:02:43| and getting it ready for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| It has quite a bit of interstate exposure, and I think it's a good place for the proposed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3765)|
| 1:02:53| and certainly something that can take advantage of its interstate exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3773)|
| 1:02:59| I had one question, and I asked it both to council and if that's Mr. Burkhart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| We haven't met in person, but we've spoken on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| And my concern is it's obvious that given the physical location of that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3786)|
| 1:03:13| we're going to be inviting traffic to come down to that narrow Pelham Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3793)|
| 1:03:20| And if it's going to be a commercial or industrial use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| that we can anticipate a fair amount of traffic and trucks and things of that nature over time coming in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3805)|
| 1:03:31| One of the tracks that's being in this package is track 27,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3811)|
| 1:03:36| and that was the old trailer park adjacent to that, and it ties it to Pelham Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3816)|
| 1:03:42| Long story short, we've got about 700 feet of road coming in from Rutledge Pike to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3822)|
| 1:03:49| It's terribly undersized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| It's maybe 17 feet wide, and it's going to have to be upgraded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3831)|
| 1:03:56| And I asked this question to both council and to Mr. Burkhart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| and that was would they be willing to participate with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3839)|
| 1:04:04| and invest some dollars in the improvement of that road if that is what we need to get this property developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3844)|
| 1:04:10| because otherwise we're going to put the burden on the taxpayers, and I don't think that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3850)|
| 1:04:15| And so I hope they're available to address that and to mention that to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3855)|
| 1:04:20| And certainly I guess that road has a big, if you've ever driven down Pelham Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| it has a real sharp, like, gooseneck turn, and then it goes down a hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| so we're concerned about traffic engineering, concerned about what happens to cars if they meet on that curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3868)|
| 1:04:34| So there's going to have to be some redress to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| and hopefully the owners can talk about their willingness to assist the city in making that right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3876)|
| 1:04:42| and improving their access so it's a win-win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| Thank you, Mr. Dellavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| Mr. Mayor, members of council, I'm here on behalf of Mr. Burkhart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3891)|
| 1:04:56| and he's here and he will specifically address the issue you raised, Councilman Dellavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3896)|
| 1:05:03| Just by way of background, part of this track, the old quarry track, was I-3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3903)|
| 1:05:12| but the sector plan and one-year plan call for low-density residential and medium-density residential for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3912)|
| 1:05:21| Mr. Burkhart acquired additional property to the west and hopes to acquire further additional property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3921)|
| 1:05:30| When we went to MPC staff to discuss this, we looked at the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| MPC staff said we think C-6 would be more appropriate for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3935)|
| 1:05:40| and Mr. Burkhart's discussed this with MPC staff, chief building official, and others in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3940)|
| 1:05:46| and we concurred, and that's why we're asking for a change in the sector plan to light industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3946)|
| 1:05:52| and that all the property, the property formally zoned I-3 and the additional property be zoned C-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3952)|
| 1:06:02| Hopefully we'll have a nice commercial park there with great interstate visibility in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3962)|
| 1:06:10| I will say in response to your question, Councilman Dellavopi, that Mr. Burkhart would like to partner with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3970)|
| 1:06:20| Right now, Spring Hill Road is the only feasible access to the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3980)|
| 1:06:26| but he hopes to acquire additional property going towards Rutledge Pike because that would be the primary hopeful entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3986)|
| 1:06:34| Right near the exit of the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| It gets you right onto an interchange where you can suddenly be on 40 east or west, 640, which would get you 75, and 275.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=3996)|
| 1:06:47| It's ideal logistically for a distribution business there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4007)|
| 1:06:53| We don't have that property tonight, but Mr. Burkhart is working on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4013)|
| 1:06:58| and I would think ultimately that would be how it would be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4018)|
| 1:07:02| But, Chris, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| And I greatly appreciate him coming and talking to us because that's, when you look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4026)|
| 1:07:10| it's really an ingenious thing you've done with that property and filling it and making it usable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4030)|
| 1:07:14| and it's going to be, I think, an attractive facility when you're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4039)|
| 1:07:20| I'm pleased with your business acumen and hard work in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4040)|
| 1:07:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| It's been hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4045)|
| 1:07:26| It's been a fun project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| If you would give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4050)|
| 1:07:31| Chris Burkhart, 3340 Kingston Pike in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| Yeah, it's been a fun project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| It's been a lot of hard work, and we started out not really knowing where it was going to go because it was an enormous quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4056)|
| 1:07:42| And we said, well, it'll never be filled in in our lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| And then after a number of years we look up and it's done, it's full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4066)|
| 1:07:50| So we're trying to get it now to the next stage so that we can attract the right kind of business that would want to locate there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4070)|
| 1:07:56| that would appreciate access, appreciate visibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| So our goal is to take it from the point it's in now and continue to landscape it, improve it, and just continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4079)|
| 1:08:06| How many years have you been working on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4086)|
| 1:08:10| About ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| And my dad's been an instrumental part of that, who actually is now 85.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| But he started out working in the bottom of that quarry when he was 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| So I told him, you still can't get out of the hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| Well, I've passed it many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| It's very close to the surface now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4103)|
| 1:08:24| And he's been working there for a lot of years on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| I know exactly where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| I guess, Mr. Mayor, would you address the question of if we have to improve Pelham Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4112)|
| 1:08:38| You're in the construction business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4118)|
| 1:08:39| You've got heavy equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4119)|
| 1:08:40| You obviously could help us grade and prepare a road there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| We're going to have to do something if your trucks and your customers are going to be coming up that little narrow country road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4123)|
| 1:08:49| that I guess is just barely paved, if you want to think about it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| Very much so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| I think when we can finally figure out what the property is going to be and who's going to be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| and come up with a design that we would want to partner with the city and help develop that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4138)|
| 1:09:03| and improve those infrastructure access points into the property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| So we're more than happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| I hope you or your staff will meet with Mr. King or his people about that as you go forward and walk that through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4150)|
| 1:09:17| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4157)|
| 1:09:18| And we've worked with his department for the last 10 years in that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| So they're very familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| Thank you so much for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| Can we name it Midway Business Park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4166)|
| 1:09:32| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| I think that's a bad name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4173)|
| 1:09:34| Could you pick a closer in park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4178)|
| 1:09:39| There's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4186)|
| 1:09:47| Someone else signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4187)|
| 1:09:50| If you would come down, sir, and I guess we'll just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| We didn't actually vote, did we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| I didn't hear us finish that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4196)|
| 1:09:57| We did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4197)|
| 1:09:58| We did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4198)|
| 1:09:59| That's why we can, I believe, can stop and allow this gentleman, if you would give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4199)|
| 1:10:05| Tom Zito, 384 Nash Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| I live right across from the entrance to the quarry is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4208)|
| 1:10:14| And it took him two and a half years to fill it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| And we put up with the dust for this amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| All I'm trying to do is get him to pay part of it to keep the dust down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| He doesn't want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| And he doesn't care about the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| He just cares about himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| And I understand him trying to make money and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| I'm not trying to stop the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| We're just trying to get the dust eliminated, and he doesn't want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4236)|
| 1:10:42| And the whole quarry itself we put up with anywhere from 100 to 200 loads of dirt for two and a half years dumping there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4242)|
| 1:10:50| all hours of the night, and you don't even know what's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4250)|
| 1:10:55| Nobody inspected anything or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| I'm not trying to stop him from having a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| I'm just trying to stop from having to put up with the dust and the noise all night long sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4263)|
| 1:11:10| That's all I'm trying to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| And nobody's tried to talk to us about anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4272)|
| 1:11:19| Mr. Mayor, I may recognize Councilman Woodall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4279)|
| 1:11:24| Could you explain to me where you want it paved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| I'm just trying to get it paved from Spring Hill Road up past where Roche's building is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4286)|
| 1:11:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4292)|
| 1:11:33| To eliminate the dust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4293)|
| 1:11:34| The trees will stop all the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| Could the other gentleman respond to his request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4297)|
| 1:11:44| The process of filling this quarry in, it's been about a million and a half cubic yards of fill material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4304)|
| 1:11:49| And we certainly know where everything is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| And Mr. King's office, the way that process was permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| we were very careful, very vigilant to accept only clean material so we know what's in the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4314)|
| 1:11:59| And we do apologize for the dust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| And we have always taken measures to mitigate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| We've had an irrigation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| We've had water trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| The fact of the matter is when you're doing construction, you're going to have dirt and dust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| And in the process of trying to manage dust, if you're not too careful, you're going to have mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| Then you're going to get a complaint about mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| So the great thing about it is that the property in terms of fill is really complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4339)|
| 1:12:25| So at one time where we did have a lot of traffic and sometimes it would be at night to facilitate a TDOT job, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4345)|
| 1:12:33| that needed to do bridge work or something, that work is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| So we're no longer taking, you know, fill material in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| There may be a few remnant loads here and there as we try to do the final grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4359)|
| 1:12:44| But in terms of all heavy construction of dirt coming in or truckloads coming in, we're not going to have any more of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4364)|
| 1:12:51| But you're still going to have the dust, aren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| Well, I think until you finally get a commercial development in there, it is a construction site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4374)|
| 1:12:59| There will be some dust in the summertime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| Yeah, it's pretty bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| You can't even see the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4383)|
| 1:13:04| It gets so bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| Well, we're not going to have a debate on that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4387)|
| 1:13:11| So what I'm saying is where it's coming in now, it comes up springing off Raleigh's Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4391)|
| 1:13:17| You've got tractor and trailers coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| And when there's a car sitting at the red light, they can't even turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| So they have to wait for the light to change for that car to get out now, at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4404)|
| 1:13:29| before you can get a tractor and trailer in hauling these big ukes that he's got in there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4409)|
| 1:13:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| Mr. DellaVopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| I was going to wonder if Mr. King, or I don't see anyone from the building department here, but don't we have some dust either suppression criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4418)|
| 1:13:48| or the potential for maybe, and maybe the owner could address this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| of seeding some of the areas that would eliminate the number of areas that have dust blowing off it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4433)|
| 1:14:00| Well, there was probably thousands of yards of concrete dumped in there before that they could have paved it with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| And they never did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| Well, as I recall, when they were doing all that I-40 construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| a lot of that cracked up concrete that they took out to widen the road was put in that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4450)|
| 1:14:16| Oh, yeah, there was concrete from an old ready mix plant down there that I worked at from high school, which had zonalite in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4456)|
| 1:14:23| So let's see if Mr. King has some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| We don't see the building department folks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| Mr. King, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| Mayor Brown, if it would be okay with you, I'd be happy to give this gentleman my phone number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4468)|
| 1:14:33| and I'll get with him and take a look at his concerns and see how we can help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| I think that would be a good solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| Hopefully it will be a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| He's never talked to us about anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| Well, get with Mr. King and we'll see if we can't come to some solution on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4483)|
| 1:14:50| And we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4490)|
| 1:14:55| Mr. Seymour, did you want to make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| I spoke with this gentleman after the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| He's off Spring Hill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| Ultimately, when this property is developed, and assuming some other property can be acquired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4504)|
| 1:15:12| the primary entrance to the site will be off Rutledge Pike, which will be at the opposite end of the site from his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4512)|
| 1:15:20| And Spring Hill Road would only be a secondary entrance into the property then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4520)|
| 1:15:26| And I think that will address a good number of his concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| Well, another one of my concerns is from Pelham Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| Well, I'm going to ask you, because we're getting into a debate between you two, and we're not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4532)|
| 1:15:40| We're going to have a motion on the floor and we stop to hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4540)|
| 1:15:46| Let us return to vote on that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| Would you restate the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| The motion is to approve on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Becker, I didn't see your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| I guess I like the idea of Mr. King meeting with this gentleman, and although I won't be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4557)|
| 1:16:03| I think it might be good to ask Mr. King to report back to council before we vote in two weeks on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4563)|
| 1:16:09| because we'll consider it again, and I think knowing what we're doing can be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4569)|
| 1:16:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| I don't know if we'd need a motion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| If you would restate the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| To approve the ordinance on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4587)|
| 1:16:28| Sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4588)|

| 1:17:23| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| Yes, Mr. DelaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| Mr. Donaldson, do I understand the way C6 is set up in this regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4645)|
| 1:17:29| you will have formal plan and review when there's an actual proposal to put commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4649)|
| 1:17:36| or industrial structures on here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4658)|
| 1:17:39| At that time, you can also take steps to add measures that accommodate traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4659)|
| 1:17:46| or lighting or those kinds of things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4668)|
| 1:17:49| The history of this particular case is that it originally came in as a request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4669)|
| 1:17:53| for industrial zoning, and at that time, staff raised the issue about Pelham Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4673)|
| 1:17:58| and had it continued that way, probably would have conditioned the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4678)|
| 1:18:02| that no access be taken from Pelham until it was upgraded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4682)|
| 1:18:06| With the C6 and administrative site plan approval, we get to manage that through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4686)|
| 1:18:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4693)|
| 1:18:14| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4694)|
| 1:18:15| So you get a second bite of the apple at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4695)|
| 1:18:16| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4696)|
| 1:18:17| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| Seeing no further lights, we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4702)|
| 1:18:29| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4709)|
| 1:18:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4710)|
| 1:18:31| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| Ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| 12J is in ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4715)|
| 1:18:36| Three-zone property located on the northwest side of Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| northeast of Smithwood Road from R2 to O1, CAD Properties, 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4719)|
| 1:18:47| I think we have two people signed up to speak on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4727)|
| 1:18:52| Mr. Mayor, if I might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| I would like to change this motion or amend it to move to change from R2 to O3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4734)|
| 1:19:02| and I'll be happy to address that either now or later at your behest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4742)|
| 1:19:07| But I think that that's the proposal that I would like to have on the table that we look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4747)|
| 1:19:12| Well, we need a motion to approve first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4755)|
| 1:19:16| And then we amend the motion, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4758)|
| 1:19:19| We'll let the people move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4759)|
| 1:19:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| Now I'd like to make my motion that we amend that to approve it as changing it from the current zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4763)|
| 1:19:30| which is R2 General Residential, to O3, which is Office Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4770)|
| 1:19:35| and that would cover the tract on which Dr. and Mrs. Berg's business is on as it faces Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4775)|
| 1:19:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4784)|
| 1:19:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4785)|
| 1:19:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4786)|
| 1:19:47| Now we have a person signed up to speak on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4787)|
| 1:19:54| We have Charlotte Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4794)|
| 1:19:59| If you'd give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| I'm Charlotte Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4803)|
| 1:20:04| I reside at 104 Crawford Road, and I'm here to represent Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4804)|
| 1:20:09| There may be a bit of confusion for you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4809)|
| 1:20:14| because what I'm going to say is not what was said in a short letter that you all received a few days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4814)|
| 1:20:26| And the reason is that we did not know until this morning that Dr. and Mrs. Berg had changed their position on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4826)|
| 1:20:37| because after the MPC meeting on December the 9th, they said that they would be in favor of the O3 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4837)|
| 1:20:48| Therefore, to give a little bit of background on this rezoning request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4848)|
| 1:20:56| the Board of Fountain City Town Hall supports the plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| but we support the rezoning from R2 to O3 rather than O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4860)|
| 1:21:07| In August of 2010, Dr. and Mrs. Berg, at their request, met with members of Fountain City Town Hall Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4867)|
| 1:21:15| and presented their desire to have their medical property on Haswell Pike rezoned from R2 to O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4875)|
| 1:21:23| Their stated reason for this request was to have more flexibility in the types of offices that are permitted in an O1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4883)|
| 1:21:32| This was their only given reason at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4892)|
| 1:21:37| The applicants told Town Hall Board that MPC had advised them to meet with the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4897)|
| 1:21:42| so that we could identify any conditions for their rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4902)|
| 1:21:48| At a later Board meeting, members decided on certain conditions designed to remove incompatible uses allowed in the O1 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4908)|
| 1:21:59| such as private clubs and halfway houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| These conditions were presented to Dr. and Mrs. Berg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4923)|
| 1:22:07| On November 4, Councilman Della Volpe met with reps from Town Hall and Dr. and Mrs. Berg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4927)|
| 1:22:14| The conditions were discussed and there was disagreement about some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4934)|
| 1:22:20| Based on the fact that an agreement could not be met regarding the proposed conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4940)|
| 1:22:25| and also on the fact that conditions connected to rezonings have not really been tested in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4945)|
| 1:22:33| it is Fountain City Town Hall's opinion that the O3 zone best accomplishes the stated goals of all parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4953)|
| 1:22:41| while providing the necessary protection for the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4961)|
| 1:22:47| the point being to have zoning that protects the neighborhood with either present or future owners of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4967)|
| 1:22:56| There is an O3 zone across Tazewell Pike on a lot smaller than the Berg's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4976)|
| 1:23:06| Another concern is that Dr. and Mrs. Berg own the lot immediately behind their property fronting Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4986)|
| 1:23:14| The second lot is zoned R2 and has a house on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| And the only access to this lot is through the lot on Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=4998)|
| 1:23:23| Our concern about this is that the two lots could be combined without any public hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5003)|
| 1:23:29| a reason why it is important to very carefully choose the proper zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5009)|
| 1:23:36| The R2 property is adjacent to a very viable neighborhood with houses on three sides of the R2 property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5016)|
| 1:23:44| These are the reasons why we ask for your support of an O3 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5024)|
| 1:23:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5029)|
| 1:23:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| You know, I talked to the Berg's earlier today and as I did the last time this came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5035)|
| 1:24:00| And I think there's been a little confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| I received the email earlier and I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| I know who made the motion, but I'm not sure who made the second on changing this from O1 to O3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5047)|
| 1:24:16| But when this came up initially, I was wondering, I had my lights on to see if we had any speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5056)|
| 1:24:23| Because, you know, I'm one that would like to hear from the Berg's again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5063)|
| 1:24:28| I think they're like a lot of folks that go through this process and they would do something different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5068)|
| 1:24:36| but they really want to do something, in this case, an O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5076)|
| 1:24:40| But they don't want us to vote on an O1 and it go back or stay as an R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5080)|
| 1:24:48| So I think, you know, the last time we had this discussion, there was a lot of confusion about the plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5088)|
| 1:24:54| And we discussed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| And now here we are again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5096)|
| 1:24:57| And now we're at a we've got an amendment here that we're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5097)|
| 1:25:02| without even giving the Berg's the right to have an up and down O1 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5102)|
| 1:25:07| And so I guess the Berg's are signed up to speak or someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5107)|
| 1:25:11| I don't know if the Berg's are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5111)|
| 1:25:15| Oh, they are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5115)|
| 1:25:16| But let me recognize, are you finished, Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| I am, but that was my original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| When this first came up, and I didn't make the motion to approve or anything because I thought we had speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5121)|
| 1:25:27| and we wanted to hear the speakers, but now no one's signed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5127)|
| 1:25:31| They did not sign up, but they are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| And I would certainly agree that we should hear from them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| I don't mean for them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| Because, you know, this came up the last time that the Berg's had agreed to an O3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5139)|
| 1:25:45| And we had the discussion about possibly some conditions on O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5145)|
| 1:25:54| And I think they ought to have the right to hear O1 and if there's some conditions that might want to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5154)|
| 1:26:00| Because I've tried to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| I think we're all supportive of good development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5162)|
| 1:26:09| And I'm really trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5169)|
| 1:26:10| And I just heard Ms. Davis say that they're concerned that under the O1 that you could combine two lots and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5170)|
| 1:26:18| and there wouldn't be a public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| And I didn't catch the public meeting or public what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5180)|
| 1:26:25| But I'd like to hear from the Berg's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5189)|
| 1:26:30| Or someone that would represent the owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| If you want to recognize them, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| Let me go to Councilman Becker before we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5195)|
| 1:26:40| I guess I have two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| First, you said there were two people signed up to speak and we only heard from one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5202)|
| 1:26:46| But I guess also just from Mr. Bailey, the concern you raised about somehow this ending up not being changed to office at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5206)|
| 1:26:55| And I think the way it's structured, the way Mr. DellaVape has made the motion, is we're going to consider O3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5215)|
| 1:27:02| And if that fails, it's still a motion to go to O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5224)|
| 1:27:05| So I think – and I think actually there is consensus all over that this should be an office zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5225)|
| 1:27:10| And I think in a lot of ways the debate we're having about O1, O3 is over some fairly small issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5230)|
| 1:27:16| I mean, it really is a little more uses under O1, a little more design flexibility under O3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5236)|
| 1:27:23| So it's a small concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| I think the consensus is definitely this is going to be an office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| and we want the Berg's to go ahead with what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| And I think Fountain City Town Hall definitely agrees with that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| that this is a project that should be moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| So – but thanks for raising that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5262)|
| 1:27:43| Councilman DellaVape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5263)|
| 1:27:44| I probably should have said this at the time of my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| I was deferring to how you wanted to run that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| But a little bit of the background is that everyone has worked very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5269)|
| 1:27:54| And I mean the neighborhoods, the Berg's have gotten together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| I have had several meetings that lasted, you know, an hour and a half or longer talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5278)|
| 1:28:04| There came a time in late November before our last council meeting where we addressed this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5284)|
| 1:28:11| where it was pretty clear that we were going to get into some area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5291)|
| 1:28:16| We weren't sure how far the conditions could or should go on O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5296)|
| 1:28:21| And we talked about O3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| At the end of that meeting, I think there was – this was probably at the Panera Bread Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5303)|
| 1:28:29| We had an agreement that – I just killed your machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| We had an agreement that it would go at least to MPC to hear it as O3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5314)|
| 1:28:40| And if you look at the minutes that have been attached to this proposal, the minutes of December the 9th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5320)|
| 1:28:47| Ms. Bird and Ms. Rowe and I think Ms. Davis at least were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5327)|
| 1:28:52| And they all spoke to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5332)|
| 1:28:54| And at that time they were all saying we asked for O3, including the Berg's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5334)|
| 1:28:59| I spoke to them today and – oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5339)|
| 1:29:02| And we had Mark Rousseau from MPC saying that either O1 or O3 will be consistent with the plan minutes we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5342)|
| 1:29:09| because they deal with office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| And office is a generic term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| And now the question is which zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| But – and they said that they really didn't have an objection to O3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| But in MPC's view, they wanted – they preferred O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5360)|
| 1:29:24| But I think that Councilman Becker has hit it on the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| That is, when you look at O3, it is somewhat of a transition zone from residential to other uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5368)|
| 1:29:36| And it allows all of the professional office building types that they were talking about when they went to the town hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5376)|
| 1:29:42| It also includes clinics, medical and dental offices, radio, TV, studio, art gallery, public and private schools, on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5382)|
| 1:29:50| And there's some things about accessory buildings and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| It did not have some of the items that the neighborhood groups were concerned could bring perhaps undue noise or traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5393)|
| 1:30:00| And that was the reason for shifting the emphasis towards O3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5400)|
| 1:30:05| We were forced as a body to consult with MPC last time this came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| And it went before them on December 9th because we can act different than they recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5411)|
| 1:30:16| But we can't act without getting their advice and their recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5416)|
| 1:30:20| And so we've gone through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| I did speak to the Byrds today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| And I guess they want to be sure they end up with an office zone because that's something they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5424)|
| 1:30:30| And they want to have the flexibility of their site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5430)|
| 1:30:33| They have expressed a view, and I guess they'll tell you themselves what it is, that there's some preference for O1, but that O3 is also acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5433)|
| 1:30:42| And we never – I mean, I guess we thought we were there in mid-December, but now we seem to have drifted slightly apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5442)|
| 1:30:49| And so I think we should hear from both the town halls and the Byrds and then make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5449)|
| 1:30:55| But it's my recommendation to this body that O3 accomplishes the essential goal of getting them the flexible office uses for that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5455)|
| 1:31:05| And hopefully it takes out some of the uses that could impact the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5465)|
| 1:31:10| And that's kind of why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5470)|
| 1:31:14| So thank you much for having a chance to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5477)|
| 1:31:18| Thank you, Councilman Dellavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5480)|
| 1:31:21| Well, and I'd like to thank Councilman Dellavopi for all his work as the district councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5481)|
| 1:31:26| And I'm always – I mean, zoning is the toughest thing we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| And I'm always looking for some sort of a compromise where the property owners and the neighborhoods are all in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5490)|
| 1:31:38| But the one concern I have is, you know, we can read right here what has happened with the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5498)|
| 1:31:45| and what the MPC originally said and what they've said since we sent it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5505)|
| 1:31:50| And I've talked to Mr. Donaldson about what's transpired here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| And what I think, rather than to go back and to have this explained to us, I mean, the Byrds are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5514)|
| 1:32:01| the Fountain City Town Hall representatives are here, that we should just hear exactly what they would like to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5521)|
| 1:32:09| and then we can ask them questions as individuals and then make our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| I think we should hear from all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5533)|
| 1:32:14| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5534)|
| 1:32:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| And a lot of people come up here and they're not intimidated, but they don't sometimes feel like they can express themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5537)|
| 1:32:27| And even with neighborhood associations, sometimes they don't, especially if there's some opposition or disagreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5547)|
| 1:32:33| So I think that's why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5553)|
| 1:32:36| And I think that we ought to – you know, they ought to come up and tell us what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5556)|
| 1:32:40| And then they really like – and I said this the last time – they deserve a straight up and down vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5560)|
| 1:32:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5566)|
| 1:32:47| Thank you, Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5567)|
| 1:32:48| And we will recognize the Byrds, but we have one other person who had already signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5568)|
| 1:32:55| So we'll recognize Ms. Jamie Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5575)|
| 1:33:00| Thank you, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5580)|
| 1:33:01| Give your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5581)|
| 1:33:02| Jamie Rowe, 4215 Tazewell Pike, representing the Tazewell Pike Beverly Station neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5582)|
| 1:33:09| At the December MPC meeting, the applicant approached us and told us she was comfortable with the 03.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5589)|
| 1:33:22| With her coming up to the podium and stating that 03 was in the best interest of everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5602)|
| 1:33:28| Fountain City Town Hall representative, which was Charlotte, and our neighborhood, which was me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5608)|
| 1:33:34| echoed those and spoke in favor of the 03 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5614)|
| 1:33:39| We all agreed that 03 would be appropriate for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5619)|
| 1:33:44| We do understand that economic times are such that it would be advantageous to the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5624)|
| 1:33:50| to have additional options for offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| So we're happy to compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| We don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| What makes this property unique, and Ms. Davis touched on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5638)|
| 1:34:04| is the fact that another lot, which has a house on it, zoned R2, adjoins this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5644)|
| 1:34:13| And the only access to this lot is through the property that you're speaking about at this time to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5653)|
| 1:34:22| Therefore, the possible uses must be considered even more carefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5662)|
| 1:34:28| than if it was just a lot that faced Tazewell Pike without this additional lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5668)|
| 1:34:34| The 03 that is already there diagonally across the street is a really good example of what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5674)|
| 1:34:43| There was a dental office on that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5683)|
| 1:34:50| The dentist retired, and they have been able to rent that property out with a realtor, a financial planner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5690)|
| 1:34:59| and I believe it's an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| But anyway, there's three or four offices in there, so there were multiple uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5701)|
| 1:35:05| rather than just if it had stayed R2 where they could have dental or medical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5705)|
| 1:35:10| So the 03 has worked very well on that piece of property through a transition of renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5710)|
| 1:35:19| We asked city council to support the rezoning to the 03 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5719)|
| 1:35:25| And as you can see on your map, the 03 is on a smaller piece of property almost diagonally across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5725)|
| 1:35:34| The 03 zone is the only office zone referred to as a transition zone in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5734)|
| 1:35:43| 03 is a transitional zone that offers many office uses and other uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5743)|
| 1:35:50| while limiting more intrusive uses that we would find objectionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5750)|
| 1:35:55| And just to give you an example of one would be private clubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5755)|
| 1:36:00| We don't want a mouse's ear on Tassel Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| In other words, the 03 would be a win-win solution for the owners as well as the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5763)|
| 1:36:11| And it's a good compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| We also support the one-year plan amendment and the sector plan amendment for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5774)|
| 1:36:20| and the rezoning to 03.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| Thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| Dr. Bird or Mrs. Bird, would you like to come down to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5788)|
| 1:36:34| We'll give you a name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| Lisa has had some foot surgery, so she's walking tenderly down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| We appreciate you coming down here and doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| Yes, and I was sitting so pretty, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5802)|
| 1:36:45| My name is Lisa Bird, and I reside at 5235 Bent River Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5805)|
| 1:36:51| Councilman Becker, thank you so much for what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| Pretty much everyone's hit what we've been saying all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5813)|
| 1:36:57| And, Councilman Nick, you know, Mr. DellaVopi, you have been very instrumental in helping us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5817)|
| 1:37:03| We are asking for 01 due to the fact that when we look at the MPC meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5823)|
| 1:37:10| that at two different times they received the recommendation was for 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5830)|
| 1:37:16| We also have numerous neighbors that we went to have over 20, almost 25 signatures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5836)|
| 1:37:23| which you should have in your packet, that have all agreed that they support us with the 01,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5843)|
| 1:37:29| and also our business neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5849)|
| 1:37:31| I think the problem that I'm having here is that when there is an 03, yes, there is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5851)|
| 1:37:36| but it's not directly diagonally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| If you look on the map, it is on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| There is an 03, but we have 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| The house next to us, which is Maplewood, that is Mary Slack, Creative Structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5863)|
| 1:37:49| In 2005, she received 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| And then you have just down the street, which you get to that one before you get to the 03,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5872)|
| 1:37:58| there is Realty Executives, and that whole building area is 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5878)|
| 1:38:03| So I guess for us, we're just looking at what everyone else is doing in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5883)|
| 1:38:08| and that's why we're asking for 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| But we definitely appreciate everyone's time so, so much in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5891)|
| 1:38:15| because I know it has been a challenge for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| And so whatever the council members decide, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5897)|
| 1:38:24| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| Ms. Bird, before you go back, I know you have tender feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5906)|
| 1:38:29| I guess what I need to understand is what your opposition is to 03,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5909)|
| 1:38:37| because in general, in looking at the zoning code side by side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5917)|
| 1:38:43| it appears that 03 is perhaps less restrictive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5923)|
| 1:38:48| and allows more uses and more flexibility for the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5928)|
| 1:38:54| You know, in looking at it from the neighborhood's perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| it almost seems like the neighborhood would be arguing for 01| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| and the property owner would be arguing for 03.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| So help me to understand what uses you feel like you might lose as the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5943)|
| 1:39:09| if 03 were approved in this case and not 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| Very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| For us, I guess there's not much in the difference between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5954)|
| 1:39:20| But the concern that I have here is myself being an RN, my husband being a physician,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5960)|
| 1:39:25| that's why we're looking for the members of the city council members to make that decision for us to help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5965)|
| 1:39:31| and to guide us as to what is the right thing for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5971)|
| 1:39:34| Because when you look at the MPC recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| it states that by having 03, we lose the right to the R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5977)|
| 1:39:42| So someone that has an R2, which is a home down the street, they have more rights than we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5982)|
| 1:39:48| But, again, I see what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| And so, again, I'm standing here along with my husband,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| and we're going to just leave it up to the members because we've tried to really look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=5994)|
| 1:40:00| And sometimes you think you see everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| but then you look back and you realize that's not what it really was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6003)|
| 1:40:07| And so I guess, again, the reason why I brought up Mary Slack and creative structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6007)|
| 1:40:11| and all the other 01s around us is because I'm looking at the people that have the experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6011)|
| 1:40:16| the knowledge as to why they went with 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6016)|
| 1:40:20| They didn't pick 03, they picked 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6020)|
| 1:40:22| That was based on our decision, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| We looked at what was around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| And so that's why we decided with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6026)|
| 1:40:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6029)|
| 1:40:30| May I have a follow-up question, if that's all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| Mr. Donaldson, I don't think I was on council when those other parcels here were rezoned to 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6032)|
| 1:40:40| My sense is that perhaps those other property owners didn't ask for 03| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6040)|
| 1:40:45| because they didn't think they could get it based on the neighborhood's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6045)|
| 1:40:50| And it is a little bit unusual in that 03 is defined as an office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6050)|
| 1:40:54| I understand what Ms. Rowe said, and I did notice as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| that it's the only zone that's referenced as a transitional zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| And so can you explain, Mr. Donaldson, why the MPC, I guess, came back with either recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6062)|
| 1:41:10| but still held this preference for 01?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6070)|
| 1:41:15| Well, in making our recommendation, we start with the purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| and general description paragraph of the two zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6078)|
| 1:41:22| And as you mentioned, 03 is described as the office park district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6082)|
| 1:41:27| and it's intended for the orderly development of office parks, large areas with multiple buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6087)|
| 1:41:34| This particular request is for a single parcel with a single building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6094)|
| 1:41:41| If you look at the 01 purpose statement, I think it describes the situation that we're faced with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6101)|
| 1:41:51| And it reads in its last sentence, the intent herein is to provide locations for offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6111)|
| 1:41:57| in suburban locations near residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| So it in fact is, without saying, a transitional zone district as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6120)|
| 1:42:05| So you have both intent statements serving as a transition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6125)|
| 1:42:10| and as planners we quite often think of office uses being as a transition between commercial and residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6130)|
| 1:42:18| But this particular parcel has 01 zoning on one side and R2 zoning on the other three sides of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6138)|
| 1:42:27| So it really isn't serving as a transition to low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6147)|
| 1:42:33| It's serving as, you know, it's surrounded by R2, which is our multi-dwelling structure zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6153)|
| 1:42:39| and 01, which is what they've requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| It is a single parcel with a single building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6162)|
| 1:42:45| The concern about creating a single lot out of two existing lots doesn't change the zoning on the rear lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6165)|
| 1:42:56| so that will continue to be R2 zoning, which the owner could literally apply for a building permit tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6176)|
| 1:43:04| to build an apartment building on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6184)|
| 1:43:07| And that will stay with the land until there is a public process to change that zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6187)|
| 1:43:15| So we don't see this particular parcel as being a transition area between incompatible uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6195)|
| 1:43:22| It's a single parcel, a single building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6202)|
| 1:43:25| So in our mind, it's more like the intent of the 01 district rather than the 03.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6205)|
| 1:43:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6214)|
| 1:43:35| You know, I think my sense is this council always seeks to do no harm in these rezoning situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6215)|
| 1:43:42| and although 03 as an office park might be unusual for this application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6222)|
| 1:43:47| it appears in my study of this that it allows all of the uses and maybe even more that the property owners might want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6227)|
| 1:43:55| but is more satisfactory to the neighborhood in terms of the kinds of transitional protections that it might provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6235)|
| 1:44:03| So I guess I see a win-win with 03 from what we've heard this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6243)|
| 1:44:10| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6250)|
| 1:44:13| Getting near the end of the meeting, so I don't have that much more time to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6253)|
| 1:44:16| So I'll wax philosophical for a second here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6256)|
| 1:44:19| This is an interesting one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6259)|
| 1:44:20| I was talking with Ms. Carly Malone, who used to represent the fourth district, kind of a going away thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6260)|
| 1:44:26| and we were talking about how much work city council is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| And in a way, this is a real interesting one because the decision on this one isn't necessarily easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6269)|
| 1:44:35| because you've got, as I think Ms. Rowdy talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6275)|
| 1:44:37| it's a little bit of an advantage to 03 and a little different advantage to 01,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6277)|
| 1:44:40| and I think Ms. Byrd did a wonderful idea of saying, hey, you all are the experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6280)|
| 1:44:44| We see two good options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6284)|
| 1:44:45| We think this one's better, but we trust her on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| There's really some hard work in going on to figure out what the real specific best answer is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6288)|
| 1:44:54| and partly I say that because there are at least a couple people watching right now who want to be sitting here in two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6294)|
| 1:45:00| and they get to deal with it, and it's sort of a hint of it's a lot of work to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6300)|
| 1:45:05| But also it's a way to sort of say, well, right now I'm leaning, as Ms. Rowdy is, towards 03.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6305)|
| 1:45:12| Right now my mind feels that's well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| I want to sort of toss out an interesting question about what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6315)|
| 1:45:19| If this is a 5-4 vote and I'm part of the 5, what does that mean for two weeks from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6319)|
| 1:45:25| And whether anybody's feeling like this is one that we want to wait for the next fifth district representative on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6325)|
| 1:45:33| I'm not going to make that motion because it would be very self-serving on my part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6333)|
| 1:45:36| and I'm quite willing to vote on this, but it's an issue that you all have to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6336)|
| 1:45:40| and I don't want it to be ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| So I think that's my philosophical waxing for this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6342)|
| 1:45:50| Mr. Dellivopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| I will take one stab at philosophical waxing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6352)|
| 1:45:56| and I think everyone sincerely tried, especially in those early meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6356)|
| 1:46:01| to see how we could take 01 and take the pieces out that were going to be offensive to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6361)|
| 1:46:08| And there was some debate about which pieces worked and which ones didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6368)|
| 1:46:12| But we really were working towards that, and everyone rolled up their sleeves and looked hard at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6372)|
| 1:46:19| And after that, I did some talking and learning and studying, as we all want to do and need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6379)|
| 1:46:25| and learned that if we scratch our lawyer friends here a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6385)|
| 1:46:31| they say that courts are allowing people to do conditional zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| but there is some limit to how far they can go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6395)|
| 1:46:39| or at least their concern is that they haven't tested it all the way up to the Supreme Court to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6399)|
| 1:46:45| And so it came down to a pragmatic consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6405)|
| 1:46:51| We can sit down, and actually we're trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| When we met the second time, we thought that was the mission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6415)|
| 1:46:58| but the learning process occurred in the middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| and actually cobbled together an 01 with conditions that take out some of the uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6420)|
| 1:47:05| that bring undue traffic or late traffic and noise and those kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6425)|
| 1:47:09| and try to satisfy everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| But we make kind of a, I don't know, an 01 with a broken wing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6431)|
| 1:47:16| And rather than do that and see it kind of hobble across the grass to the tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6436)|
| 1:47:21| when the cat's chasing it into court or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6441)|
| 1:47:24| we decided 03 was a nice clean zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6444)|
| 1:47:28| We would not condition it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| It gives them the flexible uses that enables them to use their business property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6450)|
| 1:47:34| for the kinds of broader uses they wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6454)|
| 1:47:38| And literally back in mid-December, we were all singing Kumbaya,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6458)|
| 1:47:42| but you know how that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6462)|
| 1:47:43| If you ever bought a house or done anything, you have that kind of Monday morning regret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6463)|
| 1:47:48| Have I done everything right and stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| And so they wanted to test it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| But I think as I see this, it gives us a chance to pick a zone that doesn't get us into a dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6472)|
| 1:47:59| And I think that's a really worthwhile solution to the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6479)|
| 1:48:04| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6484)|
| 1:48:09| We're all seeing no further lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| Mayor, I'll just say one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6491)|
| 1:48:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6492)|
| 1:48:13| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6493)|
| 1:48:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6494)|
| 1:48:15| You know, I just think that sometimes this comes down to a matter of principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6495)|
| 1:48:20| And it makes a statement to those that are watching, you know, where we stand when it comes to, in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6500)|
| 1:48:29| the birds who want to be good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6509)|
| 1:48:32| They don't want to make the neighbors and the neighborhood association mad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6512)|
| 1:48:38| And so I appreciate Mrs. Bird saying that, but they requested O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6518)|
| 1:48:46| That's what our MPC staff recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6526)|
| 1:48:50| And you just heard Mr. Donaldson make the case for O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6530)|
| 1:48:53| So I'm going to oppose this vote for the O3, and I'm going to support O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6533)|
| 1:48:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| Mr. Mayor, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6540)|
| 1:49:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6541)|
| 1:49:02| I would like to read the MPC official, Mark Brousseau, who stated at the meeting where the vote was 9-5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6542)|
| 1:49:08| they split there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| And he says that he talks about O1 being generally better, but he says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6550)|
| 1:49:14| that being said, either O1 or O3 are consistent with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6554)|
| 1:49:18| If the request was for O3, I can't say we would necessarily recommend to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6558)|
| 1:49:24| He says, I don't think we have any particular issue with it if they agreed to O3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6564)|
| 1:49:29| And so that debate went on there, and it kind of gets bumped up to us to make the final decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6569)|
| 1:49:37| Seeing no further lights, we will be voting on the amendment from R2 to O3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6577)|
| 1:49:47| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6587)|
| 1:49:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6588)|
| 1:49:49| And I think we'll just do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6589)|
| 1:49:54| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6594)|
| 1:49:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6595)|
| 1:49:56| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6596)|

| 1:50:02| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6602)|
| 1:50:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6603)|
| 1:50:04| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6604)|
| 1:50:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6606)|

| 1:50:08| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6608)|
| 1:50:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6609)|
| 1:50:10| Councilman Whithall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6610)|
| 1:50:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6611)|
| 1:50:12| It appears that the aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6612)|
| 1:50:14| Ms. Mitchell, do you want to read the results?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6614)|
| 1:50:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6617)|
| 1:50:18| It was approved 7-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6618)|
| 1:50:20| It appears that the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6620)|
| 1:50:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| Now we need to vote as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6626)|
| 1:50:31| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6631)|
| 1:50:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6633)|
| 1:50:34| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6634)|
| 1:50:35| Ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| Mr. Mayor, I want to thank all the people who worked so hard on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6638)|
| 1:50:41| I know they all gave it their best, so I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6641)|
| 1:50:43| Mr. Toe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| 12-K is an ordinance to rezone property within certain public parks from various zones to OS1 to OS2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6645)|
| 1:50:51| Knoxville City Council applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6651)|
| 1:50:53| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6653)|
| 1:50:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6654)|
| 1:50:55| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6655)|
| 1:50:57| Councilman DellaVolpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| A great effort on part of MPC and parks working with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6659)|
| 1:51:03| I have one suggested change or correction, Mark, and it's really ministerial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6663)|
| 1:51:08| but on page 4 and then in the map section that corresponds to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6668)|
| 1:51:13| the Thomas Tank Sprickland Park, which is the one next to our library out there in East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6673)|
| 1:51:19| you have it less than an acre, but it's probably 1.3 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6679)|
| 1:51:23| We bought the automotive shop, the Maddox Automotive, and we get the city piece with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6683)|
| 1:51:29| You've got a map that's 12D10RZ, and I don't know that it has a page number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6689)|
| 1:51:34| but it shows the truncated smaller park, and now it's the bigger park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6694)|
| 1:51:38| So if you'd just, like, technically move the lines and change the description, I'll be thrilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6698)|
| 1:51:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6703)|
| 1:51:44| Was that a motion to send it back to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6704)|
| 1:51:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| It was a corrected technical error, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6707)|
| 1:51:53| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6713)|
| 1:51:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6714)|
| 1:51:55| Again, I want to thank, as I did originally, I want to thank MPC, and I want to thank Mark and his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6715)|
| 1:52:00| It appears, Mark, that we now have all our parks zoned either OS1 or OS2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6720)|
| 1:52:07| First reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6727)|
| 1:52:08| On the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| And so, again, as you look through all of this and see, number one, all the parks that we have, which is fantastic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6730)|
| 1:52:16| although I'd like to see more, I do appreciate what's been done to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6736)|
| 1:52:20| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6740)|
| 1:52:22| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6742)|
| 1:52:23| If I can say something, part of the recommendation is to keep current zoning in place on a few of the parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6743)|
| 1:52:30| the downtown parks that have either an H1 or a D1 overlay on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6750)|
| 1:52:38| and then there were actually two parts that were completely within the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6758)|
| 1:52:42| So keep those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| And then that core area of Lakeshore Park that still has the existing mental health institution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6764)|
| 1:52:51| and the other structures on it, we literally described a line around them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6771)|
| 1:52:58| and held our recommendation back from that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6778)|
| 1:53:02| That's still owned by the state, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6782)|
| 1:53:04| I think it's showing as ownership by the city now, but I don't know how that's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6784)|
| 1:53:09| As soon as that comes over, then we can correct that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6789)|
| 1:53:13| You can correct that at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| Seeing no further likes, we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6796)|
| 1:53:21| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6801)|
| 1:53:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6802)|

| 1:54:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6858)|
| 1:54:19| In conclusion, I would like to recognize someone who helped with many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6859)|
| 1:54:23| who helps with many, much of our business week in and week out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6863)|
| 1:54:26| But Charles Swanson did a particularly nice job in writing the resolution honoring Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6866)|
| 1:54:33| And we all get credit for those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| But he is the pen behind the power, and we certainly appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6876)|
| 1:54:42| Thank you, Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110111?start=6882)|
