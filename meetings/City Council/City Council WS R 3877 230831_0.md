| 0:01:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=86.0)|
| 0:01:27| All right, I want to welcome deputies to the mayor, Aaron Gill and David Brace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=87.0)|
| 0:01:30| here joining us this evening, as well as Devin Lyon, who's the third-party analysis recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=90.0)|
| 0:01:38| That will be his part of this presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=98.0)|
| 0:01:41| And also Dr. Kelly Drummond is here, so welcome to our HR director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=101.0)|
| 0:01:45| We'll go ahead and get started with some introductory remarks by Deputy Mayor Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=105.0)|
| 0:01:51| Thank you, Vice Mayor, and thank you, Council, for having us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=111.0)|
| 0:01:55| You'll excuse that David is having to do the slides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=115.0)|
| 0:01:57| so bear with us through a little extra technical fun this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=117.0)|
| 0:02:02| But, Council, as you know, the city is committed to being a model employer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=122.0)|
| 0:02:05| and that means ensuring that all of our employees have a workplace that is free of harassment and discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=125.0)|
| 0:02:11| We also, as you know, believe in civil service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=131.0)|
| 0:02:14| and we take seriously our commitment to uphold the city charter's civil service protections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=134.0)|
| 0:02:19| of equitable treatment and merit-based hiring, transfer, and promotions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=139.0)|
| 0:02:23| And, of course, we also must comply with equal employment laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=143.0)|
| 0:02:28| Compliance, however, is just the first step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=148.0)|
| 0:02:31| and we strive to create a workplace that celebrates diversity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=151.0)|
| 0:02:35| and provides a great career experience for all of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=155.0)|
| 0:02:39| And we have staff across city government who work to make that happen at all levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=159.0)|
| 0:02:44| I want to acknowledge that through both civil service and human resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=164.0)|
| 0:02:49| we're making constant improvements that advance a more equitable workplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=169.0)|
| 0:02:53| Just a few examples over the last few years with leadership from both of those departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=173.0)|
| 0:02:58| we've updated and increased supervisor and manager training on how to prevent and respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=178.0)|
| 0:03:03| to both real as well as perceived cases of discrimination and harassment in the workplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=183.0)|
| 0:03:09| We revised the KPD supervisor promotional test to remove barriers for qualified applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=189.0)|
| 0:03:15| and we've streamlined KPD and KFD hiring processes to help keep more qualified applicants in the pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=195.0)|
| 0:03:22| So I want to appreciate that that staff has been working together to make those changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=202.0)|
| 0:03:26| in the improvement of our career pathways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=206.0)|
| 0:03:30| So we're pleased tonight to have some time to discuss the next phase of analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=210.0)|
| 0:03:34| to help us better prevent and respond to discrimination and harassment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=214.0)|
| 0:03:38| That is a conversation that began in July of 2021 with city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=218.0)|
| 0:03:44| as you discussed a resolution regarding those policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=224.0)|
| 0:03:48| That resolution, R263202, for anyone keeping score at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=228.0)|
| 0:03:53| requested that the mayor study and make a report regarding the city's existing policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=233.0)|
| 0:03:58| for racist and sexist practices within city government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=238.0)|
| 0:04:01| and also outline any recommendations to strengthen those policies as permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=241.0)|
| 0:04:06| under the city's civil service rules and other applicable laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=246.0)|
| 0:04:11| So if you recall, our initial analysis, which was shared with you back in November of 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=251.0)|
| 0:04:16| recommended several areas for further study and review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=256.0)|
| 0:04:19| And tonight's presentation really focuses on that, in particular several topics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=259.0)|
| 0:04:26| where that initial report identified that a third-party review with independent experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=266.0)|
| 0:04:31| could help inform additional improvement of our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=271.0)|
| 0:04:35| So what you'll hear about tonight is where we've engaged those consultants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=275.0)|
| 0:04:41| MTAS, as well as outside council, to review peer cities' policies and procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=281.0)|
| 0:04:47| identify appropriate organizational placement of equal employment officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=287.0)|
| 0:04:51| and related responsibilities, and reviewing and making recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=291.0)|
| 0:04:54| for strengthening Chapter 15, Article 2, Division 2 of the city code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=294.0)|
| 0:04:59| which is what deals with employment discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=299.0)|
| 0:05:02| So that review of our laws, the rules that are on the books, so to speak, is complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=302.0)|
| 0:05:09| and Mr. Devin Lyon, a partner with Arnett, Baker, Draper, and Haygood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=309.0)|
| 0:05:14| will review that analysis with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=314.0)|
| 0:05:16| And as you'll see in your slide printout, this review is quite thorough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=316.0)|
| 0:05:20| so as Mr. Lyon goes through his presentation, after he's complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=320.0)|
| 0:05:25| we'd like to offer council the opportunity to ask Mr. Lyon any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=325.0)|
| 0:05:30| that you might have about that review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=330.0)|
| 0:05:32| Following that, then, I'll turn the microphone over to Dr. Kelly Drummond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=332.0)|
| 0:05:36| our director of the city's HR department, to provide a quick overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=336.0)|
| 0:05:40| of how we plan to take action and follow through on those recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=340.0)|
| 0:05:44| to strengthen our policies and processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=344.0)|
| 0:05:47| So I want to reiterate, as we get started again, that these actions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=347.0)|
| 0:05:51| that both the review and the actions that are recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=351.0)|
| 0:05:54| are designed to remain consistent with the very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=354.0)|
| 0:05:57| civil service charter protections that we hold for all city employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=357.0)|
| 0:06:00| That was an important starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=360.0)|
| 0:06:02| The charter is our constitution here locally, and so it was an important lens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=362.0)|
| 0:06:06| that we took into account and that our outside council reviewed in some detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=366.0)|
| 0:06:10| to make sure that we would remain in step with those important rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=370.0)|
| 0:06:14| So without much further ado, we appreciate your request for a workshop on this topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=374.0)|
| 0:06:18| and we'll look forward to discussing the report, recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=378.0)|
| 0:06:21| and our next steps on this important work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=381.0)|
| 0:06:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=383.0)|
| 0:06:24| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=384.0)|
| 0:06:25| Mr. Lyon, we'll let you go through the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=385.0)|
| 0:06:28| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=388.0)|
| 0:06:29| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=389.0)|
| 0:06:31| Good evening, city council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=391.0)|
| 0:06:33| It is great to be in front of and to speak with each of you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=393.0)|
| 0:06:36| To piggyback on what you just heard from Deputy Mayor Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=396.0)|
| 0:06:40| this is the second of two parts of a report that was prompted from city council's passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=400.0)|
| 0:06:46| of resolution number R263-2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=406.0)|
| 0:06:51| As part of the mayor's report that was submitted to city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=411.0)|
| 0:06:56| you heard that there were going to be consultants that would be retained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=416.0)|
| 0:07:00| MTAS being one and outside council, or me being the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=420.0)|
| 0:07:05| to do three specific things that you're going to hear about tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=425.0)|
| 0:07:09| and that's what's in bold at the bottom of this slide here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=429.0)|
| 0:07:12| My examination of the city's EEO program was to identify the appropriate organizational placement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=432.0)|
| 0:07:21| of EEO functions, to review Code Chapter 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=441.0)|
| 0:07:25| and to review the city administrative rules relative to said EEO functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=445.0)|
| 0:07:31| And for clarity, when I speak about EEO and EEO functions tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=451.0)|
| 0:07:35| I'm referring to Equal Employment Opportunity Protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=455.0)|
| 0:07:39| Those are protections that are established by federal and state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=459.0)|
| 0:07:43| for example, through the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=463.0)|
| 0:07:49| the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the amendments as of 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=469.0)|
| 0:07:53| those types of anti-discrimination measures that the city has incorporated into its own policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=473.0)|
| 0:08:01| And David, again, apologies for having to make you run the slideshow here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=481.0)|
| 0:08:05| but yeah, this is great, the executive summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=485.0)|
| 0:08:07| The report itself is organized into four parts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=487.0)|
| 0:08:12| and I will do my best to keep it organized in those four parts tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=492.0)|
| 0:08:16| The first is a brief analysis of what the city currently does regarding EEO functions and EEO enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=496.0)|
| 0:08:25| The second is to take a historical perspective and do a little bit of legal archaeology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=505.0)|
| 0:08:30| to determine why the city does what the city does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=510.0)|
| 0:08:35| The third section is where MTAS played a key role to look at benchmark peer cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=515.0)|
| 0:08:43| and determine exactly what those cities do or those counties do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=523.0)|
| 0:08:47| to comply with the federal and state requirements of EEO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=527.0)|
| 0:08:52| This was a difficult task for MTAS, as we'll hear more about later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=532.0)|
| 0:08:56| just because there are so few local governmental entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=536.0)|
| 0:09:00| that have dual HR and expansive civil service systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=540.0)|
| 0:09:05| So it was very difficult to even identify peer cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=545.0)|
| 0:09:08| who did things the way that the city of Knoxville does them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=548.0)|
| 0:09:12| But nevertheless, we were able to identify multiple governmental entities in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=552.0)|
| 0:09:18| And from looking at those benchmark survey results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=558.0)|
| 0:09:21| and from looking at the city's history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=561.0)|
| 0:09:24| and what the governing documents for the city of Knoxville actually requires in the way of EEO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=564.0)|
| 0:09:29| I was able to put together some recommendations that I will close the presentation with this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=569.0)|
| 0:09:35| So if you think of it, we're going to go through what does the city currently do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=575.0)|
| 0:09:39| why does it do it that way, what do other governments do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=579.0)|
| 0:09:43| and then what's the path forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=583.0)|
| 0:09:46| Is there a best practice we can identify and try to move toward that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=586.0)|
| 0:09:50| So what does the city currently do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=590.0)|
| 0:09:53| The city's commitment to EEO protections actually exceeds its legal obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=593.0)|
| 0:10:01| The legal obligations are set forth in federal and state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=601.0)|
| 0:10:05| They are also set forth through judicial opinions that have interpreted federal and state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=605.0)|
| 0:10:12| And the city actually does one better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=612.0)|
| 0:10:15| I say one, actually four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=615.0)|
| 0:10:17| The city has a charter that imposes additional EEO requirements for city governance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=617.0)|
| 0:10:24| The same is true of the city code, the city administrative rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=624.0)|
| 0:10:28| and then even in the civil service merit board rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=628.0)|
| 0:10:30| there are additional protections afforded to employees to effectuate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=630.0)|
| 0:10:33| and discharge the duties that are required by state and federal EEO law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=633.0)|
| 0:10:41| Going through a few of those in the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=641.0)|
| 0:10:44| the mayor is required to submit an annual report to city council on Title VI compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=644.0)|
| 0:10:49| Each agency and board of the city is also required to submit an annual report of nondiscrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=649.0)|
| 0:10:55| That goes to the mayor and then in turn is incorporated into the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=655.0)|
| 0:10:59| that is given to city council on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=659.0)|
| 0:11:02| We also have a charter provision that requires that all personnel actions must be nondiscriminatory in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=662.0)|
| 0:11:09| And then specific to the civil service merit board in Article X of the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=669.0)|
| 0:11:13| which we'll talk about more in depth later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=673.0)|
| 0:11:15| there are two key powers of the merit board that invoke EEO functionality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=675.0)|
| 0:11:22| The first is in 1003F8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=682.0)|
| 0:11:25| which is the board is entitled to hear allegations of discrimination in hiring, transfer, or promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=685.0)|
| 0:11:32| They can also hear allegations of neglect of duty or other violations of merit system principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=692.0)|
| 0:11:38| And then in Charter Section 1003F11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=698.0)|
| 0:11:41| the board is entitled to develop a program to provide for EEO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=701.0)|
| 0:11:48| Moving on to city code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=708.0)|
| 0:11:50| one of the key code chapters that you will hear me discuss again more in depth later is this Code Chapter 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=710.0)|
| 0:11:58| This is the city's nondiscrimination chapter for all city employment as expressed in code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=718.0)|
| 0:12:05| It requires a nondiscrimination clause that is incorporated in all city contracts by the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=725.0)|
| 0:12:11| And it also sets forth a blanket provision in Code Section 15-57| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=731.0)|
| 0:12:18| that prohibits discrimination in employment on all of the protected classes that you see in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=738.0)|
| 0:12:25| And all of those protected classes are all additionally protected by state and federal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=745.0)|
| 0:12:31| So those are incorporated into the city code as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=751.0)|
| 0:12:36| There are two key provisions of Chapter 15 relative to the enforcement of the city's nondiscrimination provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=756.0)|
| 0:12:45| The first is Code Section 15-53.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=765.0)|
| 0:12:49| This provision vests responsibility for carrying out and enforcing the provisions of Chapter 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=769.0)|
| 0:12:56| or the nondiscrimination provisions with a person designated by the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=776.0)|
| 0:13:01| to carry out the functions and purposes of this division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=781.0)|
| 0:13:04| But that person must be an appointed member of the Civil Service Board staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=784.0)|
| 0:13:10| Currently, the only appointed member of the Civil Service Board staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=790.0)|
| 0:13:14| is the Executive Secretary of the Civil Service Merit Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=794.0)|
| 0:13:17| So while Code Section 15-53 suggests that the mayor may designate an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=797.0)|
| 0:13:23| as the enforcing officer to carry out these nondiscrimination provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=803.0)|
| 0:13:27| in practice, there is only one position that can do that by code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=807.0)|
| 0:13:31| and that is the Executive Secretary of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=811.0)|
| 0:13:34| Section 15-54 then sets forth the powers and duties of that enforcing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=814.0)|
| 0:13:41| And these are only a few, but they are very broad, very broad powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=821.0)|
| 0:13:45| The enforcing officer shall administer and enforce the provisions of Code Chapter 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=825.0)|
| 0:13:52| shall investigate any charges of unlawful employment practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=832.0)|
| 0:13:56| and will protect persons from discrimination in employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=836.0)|
| 0:14:00| on all grounds covered by this division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=840.0)|
| 0:14:03| And there is no further clarification provided in that particular section of code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=843.0)|
| 0:14:07| which emphasizes the broad nature of those powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=847.0)|
| 0:14:11| The administrative rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=851.0)|
| 0:14:13| Once again, we have another blanket nondiscrimination prohibition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=853.0)|
| 0:14:18| in all employment practices in Administrative Rule 1.05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=858.0)|
| 0:14:22| We also have a harassment policy that the city has promulgated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=862.0)|
| 0:14:27| in Section 1.06 of the Administrative Rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=867.0)|
| 0:14:31| This creates a reporting procedure that allows any individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=871.0)|
| 0:14:35| with complaints of harassment to report such complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=875.0)|
| 0:14:39| to the Civil Service Director or to the Director of Law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=879.0)|
| 0:14:43| at which point the Civil Service Director can make a determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=883.0)|
| 0:14:47| about whether an investigation is prudent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=887.0)|
| 0:14:50| can perform that investigation if the Civil Service Director so chooses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=890.0)|
| 0:14:54| If not, the Director of Law can perform currently his own investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=894.0)|
| 0:15:00| And then a report will be issued of the findings of said investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=900.0)|
| 0:15:04| to the mayor and the department head of the affected individual or individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=904.0)|
| 0:15:09| The harassment policy also prohibits retaliation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=909.0)|
| 0:15:14| against any person who files a complaint of harassment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=914.0)|
| 0:15:17| or against anyone who participates in a harassment investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=917.0)|
| 0:15:21| There are similar protections afforded to individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=921.0)|
| 0:15:24| who have complaints of workplace violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=924.0)|
| 0:15:27| That is in Administrative Rule 1.07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=927.0)|
| 0:15:30| The reason that is included in this report is that the workplace violence policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=930.0)|
| 0:15:34| that the city has promulgated cites intimidation and harassment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=934.0)|
| 0:15:39| as bases for workplace violence to have occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=939.0)|
| 0:15:43| So they're really one and the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=943.0)|
| 0:15:45| If there is a finding of harassment, that could also invoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=945.0)|
| 0:15:49| the workplace violence policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=949.0)|
| 0:15:51| And again, the procedure for reporting those complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=951.0)|
| 0:15:53| is very similar to what I just described in Administrative Rule 1.06 with harassment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=953.0)|
| 0:15:59| And finally, the Administrative Rules have in Rule 15 an ADA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=959.0)|
| 0:16:04| or the Americans with Disabilities Act, compliance manual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=964.0)|
| 0:16:07| This sets forth the city's reasonable accommodation process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=967.0)|
| 0:16:11| for qualified individuals with a disability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=971.0)|
| 0:16:14| who have a request for an accommodation and employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=974.0)|
| 0:16:17| There is a grievance procedure under the ADA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=977.0)|
| 0:16:20| that is addressed in the ADA compliance manual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=980.0)|
| 0:16:23| And the ADA compliance manual also sets forth a reasonable accommodation committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=983.0)|
| 0:16:29| to hear appeals of reasonable accommodation requests that may have been denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=989.0)|
| 0:16:37| The organizational structure of the city also provides additional protections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=997.0)|
| 0:16:41| for EEO functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1001.0)|
| 0:16:44| One of these that I know you all are familiar with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1004.0)|
| 0:16:46| is what's colloquially referred to as the Community Empowerment Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1006.0)|
| 0:16:51| I've given a pretty complicated series of names for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1011.0)|
| 0:16:55| quote-unquote department here because it's very confusingly organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1015.0)|
| 0:17:00| This is actually an office of the mayor that by code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1020.0)|
| 0:17:05| has named the Office of Community Relations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1025.0)|
| 0:17:08| It is referred to, as I mentioned, as the Community Empowerment Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1028.0)|
| 0:17:12| that is currently run by an Office of Community Safety and Empowerment Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1032.0)|
| 0:17:17| So we have multiple names going on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1037.0)|
| 0:17:19| only one of which is codified in the Office of Community Relations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1039.0)|
| 0:17:24| And this office includes PARC, the Police Advisory Review Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1044.0)|
| 0:17:29| and works with the law department to, as stated in code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1049.0)|
| 0:17:33| ensure EEO compliance and provide additional enforcement mechanisms as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1053.0)|
| 0:17:40| Finally, the Civil Service Merit Board rules that I mentioned previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1060.0)|
| 0:17:44| also set forth yet another blanket non-discrimination provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1064.0)|
| 0:17:49| in Article III of the board rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1069.0)|
| 0:17:52| That is entitled the Equal Employment and Affirmative Action Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1072.0)|
| 0:17:55| That is a rule the Civil Service Merit Board has promulgated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1075.0)|
| 0:17:59| This rule directs the city to establish, implement, and maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1079.0)|
| 0:18:04| an Affirmative Action Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1084.0)|
| 0:18:05| And that's what the city has done in Code Chapter 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1085.0)|
| 0:18:08| and its administrative rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1088.0)|
| 0:18:10| And then in multiple departments through the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1090.0)|
| 0:18:12| you see additional department-specific policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1092.0)|
| 0:18:16| that clarify how EEO protections operate within a particular department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1096.0)|
| 0:18:23| One key example of this is the former Public Works Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1103.0)|
| 0:18:27| under the Rojero administration, engineering, public service, fleet services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1107.0)|
| 0:18:33| Those departments have a code of conduct that also carry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1113.0)|
| 0:18:36| individual anti-discrimination provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1116.0)|
| 0:18:40| You see similar policy initiatives in KFD and KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1120.0)|
| 0:18:45| through their guidelines, through their general orders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1125.0)|
| 0:18:49| that provide additional non-discrimination clauses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1129.0)|
| 0:18:53| that pertain to all city employment in those departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1133.0)|
| 0:18:56| And they provide for additional investigatory processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1136.0)|
| 0:19:00| all of which mirror the investigatory processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1140.0)|
| 0:19:03| that I referenced in Administrative Rule 1.06 for the harassment policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1143.0)|
| 0:19:07| So that's a lot, admittedly, to take in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1147.0)|
| 0:19:11| You may be thinking after hearing me recite all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1151.0)|
| 0:19:15| that sounds great, that's a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1155.0)|
| 0:19:17| What do we need to do from here and are there problems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1157.0)|
| 0:19:21| I will say that the city has done an excellent job, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1161.0)|
| 0:19:26| of focusing on compliance with EEO requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1166.0)|
| 0:19:31| But where the city has not done such a great job is focus on cohesiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1171.0)|
| 0:19:36| and how all of these different EEO protections and myriad policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1176.0)|
| 0:19:41| all intertwine and fit in with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1181.0)|
| 0:19:45| The result is that you have EEO requirements, as you've just seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1185.0)|
| 0:19:50| that are scattered throughout law, throughout governing documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1190.0)|
| 0:19:53| throughout rules, throughout even individual departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1193.0)|
| 0:19:57| And all of these different rules and policies invoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1197.0)|
| 0:20:01| numerous individual job positions throughout the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1201.0)|
| 0:20:04| and multiple departments that creates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1204.0)|
| 0:20:08| or can create organizational confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1208.0)|
| 0:20:12| So it's challenging if you're an employee of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1212.0)|
| 0:20:16| and you have an ADA reasonable accommodation request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1216.0)|
| 0:20:21| You would have to find the ADA reasonable accommodation request policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1221.0)|
| 0:20:25| in Administrative Rule 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1225.0)|
| 0:20:27| and then contact the Department of Housing and Neighborhood Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1227.0)|
| 0:20:30| where the ADA coordinator is currently located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1230.0)|
| 0:20:33| But if you had a different type of complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1233.0)|
| 0:20:37| say that you had a harassment complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1237.0)|
| 0:20:39| you would not do any of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1239.0)|
| 0:20:41| You would instead have to find Administrative Rule 1.06| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1241.0)|
| 0:20:45| in a completely different chapter of the Administrative Rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1245.0)|
| 0:20:48| and then you would have an option of either contacting the Civil Service Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1248.0)|
| 0:20:52| or the Director of Law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1252.0)|
| 0:20:54| and then depending on what each of those individuals said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1254.0)|
| 0:20:57| and what they felt about the prudence of an investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1257.0)|
| 0:21:00| you might have a different path that would be undertaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1260.0)|
| 0:21:04| Or if you had a Title VI complaint, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1264.0)|
| 0:21:07| you would not go to any of those places that I just referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1267.0)|
| 0:21:11| Instead, you would need to find the city's Title VI compliance plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1271.0)|
| 0:21:16| You would need to then contact, as it's stated in code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1276.0)|
| 0:21:20| the Office of Community Relations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1280.0)|
| 0:21:22| which is actually called the Community Empowerment Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1282.0)|
| 0:21:26| and try to seek enforcement measures there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1286.0)|
| 0:21:28| So it's a tangled web of policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1288.0)|
| 0:21:32| that has the tendency to potentially produce conflicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1292.0)|
| 0:21:36| in what employees are expected to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1296.0)|
| 0:21:38| and who they are expected to talk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1298.0)|
| 0:21:40| And obviously this is not any sort of intentional construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1300.0)|
| 0:21:45| of these various policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1305.0)|
| 0:21:47| It's the way that they have organically just come about over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1307.0)|
| 0:21:50| as different administrations and different individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1310.0)|
| 0:21:53| have examined different policies and different aspects of code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1313.0)|
| 0:21:57| again, without looking at the big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1317.0)|
| 0:22:01| And as best I can determine from looking back through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1321.0)|
| 0:22:04| nearly 100 years of city historical records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1324.0)|
| 0:22:07| this may be the first attempt to look at the big picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1327.0)|
| 0:22:10| of EEO compliance and try to find out what are best practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1330.0)|
| 0:22:15| what really works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1335.0)|
| 0:22:16| and what's going to benefit our city workforce here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1336.0)|
| 0:22:20| And to just put an emphasis on some of these conflicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1340.0)|
| 0:22:24| that have organically arisen through code changes predominantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1344.0)|
| 0:22:29| take a look at Code Section 1553.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1349.0)|
| 0:22:32| I referenced it earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1352.0)|
| 0:22:33| This is the one that states that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1353.0)|
| 0:22:35| an appointed member of the Civil Service Merit Board staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1355.0)|
| 0:22:38| is the EEO enforcing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1358.0)|
| 0:22:40| Well, that's what the code says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1360.0)|
| 0:22:42| but that actually conflicts with Charter Section 1003| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1362.0)|
| 0:22:46| that does not give the Executive Secretary any authority in that regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1366.0)|
| 0:22:51| but doesn't even give the Civil Service Merit Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1371.0)|
| 0:22:53| the authority to enforce all EEO functions in the city workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1373.0)|
| 0:23:00| As I mentioned earlier, Charter Section 1003, F8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1380.0)|
| 0:23:05| only permits the board to hear allegations of discrimination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1385.0)|
| 0:23:08| in hiring, transfer, and promotion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1388.0)|
| 0:23:10| not the broad authority that is set forth in Code Section 1553.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1390.0)|
| 0:23:14| This also conflicts internally with the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1394.0)|
| 0:23:17| in that Code Section 2-3 vests equal employment authority with the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1397.0)|
| 0:23:23| who is in turn designated the Office of Community Relations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1403.0)|
| 0:23:27| to perform EEO enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1407.0)|
| 0:23:29| So, again, we have internal conflicts within the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1409.0)|
| 0:23:33| and conflicts that go all the way back to the Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1413.0)|
| 0:23:36| The same is true for Section 2-111, as I just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1416.0)|
| 0:23:40| The code states that the Office of Community Relations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1420.0)|
| 0:23:44| functions as the city's equal employment officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1424.0)|
| 0:23:47| to administer the city's equal employment program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1427.0)|
| 0:23:50| And, again, that's in direct contravention of Code Section 15-53| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1430.0)|
| 0:23:55| that puts those same authorities within, practically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1435.0)|
| 0:23:59| the Executive Secretary of the Civil Service Merit Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1439.0)|
| 0:24:03| Yet another conflict is in Administrative Rule 1.06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1443.0)|
| 0:24:08| So, David, if you could go to the next slide, please. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1448.0)|
| 0:24:11| The harassment policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1451.0)|
| 0:24:13| As you heard me say a second ago, this directs employees to provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1453.0)|
| 0:24:16| they can make complaints to the Executive Secretary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1456.0)|
| 0:24:19| or the Civil Service Director to investigate and report findings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1459.0)|
| 0:24:22| of any type of harassment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1462.0)|
| 0:24:24| Again, that conflicts with Charter Article 10 in Section 1003| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1464.0)|
| 0:24:29| that limits the Merit Board's authority to only harass employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1469.0)|
| 0:24:34| for hiring, transfer, and promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1474.0)|
| 0:24:37| And, again, there's no authority for the Executive Secretary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1477.0)|
| 0:24:40| individually to be performing any of these tasks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1480.0)|
| 0:24:43| Those powers are only vested in the Board itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1483.0)|
| 0:24:46| The same criticism can be made toward Administrative Rule 1.07,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1486.0)|
| 0:24:52| the workplace violence policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1492.0)|
| 0:24:54| So I won't belabor that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1494.0)|
| 0:24:56| And then, finally, one final conflict of many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1496.0)|
| 0:24:59| the fifth one that I provided for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1499.0)|
| 0:25:01| is Civil Service Merit Board Rule Article 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1501.0)|
| 0:25:05| So, David, that's also on the next slide. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1505.0)|
| 0:25:08| Article 3 states that the city shall establish and, importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1508.0)|
| 0:25:14| implement and maintain an EEO plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1514.0)|
| 0:25:18| And the Merit Board's own Article 3 states that the Board has the power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1518.0)|
| 0:25:22| only to develop a program to provide for EEO, not to enforce said program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1522.0)|
| 0:25:29| And that language was specifically chosen because it is a direct quote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1529.0)|
| 0:25:33| from Article 10 of the Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1533.0)|
| 0:25:35| Those are, that that is, Provision 1003F11 of the Board's power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1535.0)|
| 0:25:41| to develop a program, not to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1541.0)|
| 0:25:45| Yet, in the Merit Board rules, Article 17, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1545.0)|
| 0:25:49| gives the Executive Secretary broad authority to investigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1549.0)|
| 0:25:52| any discrimination complaint that may be made to Civil Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1552.0)|
| 0:25:56| So, again, we have conflicts built in at almost every layer of city authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1556.0)|
| 0:26:03| So why do we have these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1563.0)|
| 0:26:07| Why does the City Code organize EEO functions the way it currently does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1567.0)|
| 0:26:12| And what does the Charter actually require regarding EEO enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1572.0)|
| 0:26:16| which is perhaps the million-dollar question here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1576.0)|
| 0:26:19| And this took me down the path of trying to trace our historical steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1579.0)|
| 0:26:26| And I'll be frank with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1586.0)|
| 0:26:28| This was a large undertaking, as you may have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1588.0)|
| 0:26:31| if you've had an opportunity to flip through this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1591.0)|
| 0:26:35| I did not realize exactly what I was setting into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1595.0)|
| 0:26:39| when I started going down this path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1599.0)|
| 0:26:41| But it took me through analyses of the Charter all the way back to 1945,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1601.0)|
| 0:26:48| City Code all the way back to 1962, law director opinions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1608.0)|
| 0:26:52| Civil Service Merit Board meeting minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1612.0)|
| 0:26:54| Charter Review Commission documents, Knox News Sentinel articles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1614.0)|
| 0:26:57| even City Employees League meeting minutes and speaking notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1617.0)|
| 0:27:01| And going through all those documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1621.0)|
| 0:27:04| I think there is an answer for why the city has established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1624.0)|
| 0:27:08| its EEO functions in this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1628.0)|
| 0:27:10| and there is an answer for what the Charter actually requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1630.0)|
| 0:27:14| And that answer, as it became apparent from reviewing these documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1634.0)|
| 0:27:18| is that EEO enforcement must be, pursuant to Charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1638.0)|
| 0:27:22| must be performed by the city administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1642.0)|
| 0:27:25| through the mayor and the executive branch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1645.0)|
| 0:27:28| rather than how it is currently organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1648.0)|
| 0:27:31| And to clarify, this historical analysis is in no way intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1651.0)|
| 0:27:37| to bolster any division of the city over another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1657.0)|
| 0:27:41| It is simply an assessment of what the Charter and the Code require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1661.0)|
| 0:27:46| and what they were designed to accomplish when they were drafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1666.0)|
| 0:27:50| And this is a question of critical importance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1670.0)|
| 0:27:52| because even if we can identify what other governments may do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1672.0)|
| 0:27:56| in Section 3 of this report with our benchmark survey from MTAS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1676.0)|
| 0:28:00| that is irrelevant if our Charter requires us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1680.0)|
| 0:28:03| to perform certain duties in a certain way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1683.0)|
| 0:28:06| So the question of what does the Charter require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1686.0)|
| 0:28:09| must be answered first before moving on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1689.0)|
| 0:28:12| can we improve what we're currently doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1692.0)|
| 0:28:14| based on what other local governments do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1694.0)|
| 0:28:17| So bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1697.0)|
| 0:28:18| I'm going to, as quickly as I can, hit the highlights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1698.0)|
| 0:28:22| of what this historical analysis made apparent to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1702.0)|
| 0:28:27| and to demonstrate, I hope, how I've concluded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1707.0)|
| 0:28:30| that the executive branch and the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1710.0)|
| 0:28:32| must be the division of the city that is tasked with EEO enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1712.0)|
| 0:28:38| In 1945, the Charter actually set forth a civil service board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1718.0)|
| 0:28:45| The board only handled examinations and certifications of city employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1725.0)|
| 0:28:50| Any prejudicial acts, as they were termed at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1730.0)|
| 0:28:53| were only resolved by the department head of the individual and the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1733.0)|
| 0:28:58| And while there was a separate board of civil service appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1738.0)|
| 0:29:01| that heard major penalties or significant disciplinary actions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1741.0)|
| 0:29:05| those were only disciplinary actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1745.0)|
| 0:29:07| that had nothing to do with discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1747.0)|
| 0:29:10| Again, this is 1945 prior to federal protections relating to EEO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1750.0)|
| 0:29:14| so there was no involvement by the civil service board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1754.0)|
| 0:29:17| in EEO matters at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1757.0)|
| 0:29:20| The same is true in 1962.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1760.0)|
| 0:29:23| The board held the same powers and duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1763.0)|
| 0:29:27| All that had changed at this point was that a secretary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1767.0)|
| 0:29:30| or executive secretary as it's now termed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1770.0)|
| 0:29:32| was created to keep a minute book of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1772.0)|
| 0:29:35| And this continued for 36 years where the mayor and administration alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1775.0)|
| 0:29:40| resolved and fielded any what would be termed today EEO complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1780.0)|
| 0:29:45| and that's despite the existence of the civil service board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1785.0)|
| 0:29:48| for the duration of that period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1788.0)|
| 0:29:50| Now, in 1968, we see the first ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1790.0)|
| 0:29:53| that the city through city council enacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1793.0)|
| 0:29:57| that related to non-discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1797.0)|
| 0:29:59| This was a non-discrimination clause for all city contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1799.0)|
| 0:30:03| and again, it provided very little guidance in the way of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1803.0)|
| 0:30:07| what area of the city was to enforce this non-discrimination clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1807.0)|
| 0:30:11| I gather that because a violation of this clause was deemed a misdemeanor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1811.0)|
| 0:30:16| it could only be enforced by KPD and the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1816.0)|
| 0:30:19| but the code was silent relative to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1819.0)|
| 0:30:22| In 1973, city council passed ordinance number 5559,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1822.0)|
| 0:30:28| and this was in response to the Civil Rights Act of 1964| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1828.0)|
| 0:30:32| and the EEO Act of 1972.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1832.0)|
| 0:30:35| City council passed this ordinance expressly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1835.0)|
| 0:30:39| to implement an affirmative action program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1839.0)|
| 0:30:42| to sort out how complaints alleging discrimination would be processed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1842.0)|
| 0:30:47| and this was actually the very first iteration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1847.0)|
| 0:30:50| of what today you see in code chapter 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1850.0)|
| 0:30:53| It's actually very similar to what we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1853.0)|
| 0:30:56| and in this excerpt that I've included here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1856.0)|
| 0:31:00| section 10 of this ordinance stated that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1860.0)|
| 0:31:04| enforcing the provisions shall be placed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1864.0)|
| 0:31:08| with the equal employment opportunity officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1868.0)|
| 0:31:10| who shall be an appointed member of the mayor's staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1870.0)|
| 0:31:13| That language may sound very familiar, and it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1873.0)|
| 0:31:17| That is roughly the same language we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1877.0)|
| 0:31:20| in code section 15-53 today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1880.0)|
| 0:31:23| All that's happened is we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1883.0)|
| 0:31:26| the city council has changed the title| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1886.0)|
| 0:31:29| of the individuals who would be enforcing said EEO protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1889.0)|
| 0:31:34| So the titles have changed, but the language have not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1894.0)|
| 0:31:38| and this demonstrates that chapter 15 was originally intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1898.0)|
| 0:31:42| for mayoral or administration enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1902.0)|
| 0:31:45| and second, it bolsters the point that I made earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1905.0)|
| 0:31:48| about the lack of a cohesive policy for EEO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1908.0)|
| 0:31:51| By simply changing the name of the individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1911.0)|
| 0:31:55| who were appointed members of a particular body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1915.0)|
| 0:31:59| or who maintain close and direct liaison with the merit board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1919.0)|
| 0:32:03| that demonstrates the lack of cohesiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1923.0)|
| 0:32:06| and actually builds in some ambiguity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1926.0)|
| 0:32:08| when you have currently the only appointed member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1928.0)|
| 0:32:11| of the civil service board who is by code required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1931.0)|
| 0:32:14| to maintain direct and close liaison with the merit board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1934.0)|
| 0:32:18| Obviously, that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1938.0)|
| 0:32:21| In 1973, the same ordinance, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1941.0)|
| 0:32:27| it also clarified the powers of the EEO officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1947.0)|
| 0:32:32| and the important takeaway here is that these provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1952.0)|
| 0:32:35| are nearly verbatim to what we see in code section 15-54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1955.0)|
| 0:32:40| So the powers and duties of the individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1960.0)|
| 0:32:43| has not changed over this period of time, in 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1963.0)|
| 0:32:47| And then to emphasize the organizational nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1967.0)|
| 0:32:51| of this position at that time, as you can see I've highlighted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1971.0)|
| 0:32:53| the EEO officer operated independent from civil service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1973.0)|
| 0:32:58| which fell under the personnel office as of 1976.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1978.0)|
| 0:33:04| The next matter of significance, also in 1976,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1984.0)|
| 0:33:09| was an ordinance that approved recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1989.0)|
| 0:33:12| from a charter revision commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1992.0)|
| 0:33:14| This revision commission proposed, among other matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1994.0)|
| 0:33:18| the consolidation of personnel and civil service functions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1998.0)|
| 0:33:22| and this was the, just as we saw the first iteration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2002.0)|
| 0:33:25| of code chapter 15 previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2005.0)|
| 0:33:28| this review commission recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2008.0)|
| 0:33:31| was actually the first iteration of what is now charter article 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2011.0)|
| 0:33:35| It proposed the powers and duties of the merit board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2015.0)|
| 0:33:38| but with one key difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2018.0)|
| 0:33:41| and that is that there was no mention of EEO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2021.0)|
| 0:33:44| or any development of an EEO program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2024.0)|
| 0:33:46| in the original draft of what would ultimately become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2026.0)|
| 0:33:50| article 10 of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2030.0)|
| 0:33:52| And the charter revision commission even clarified itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2032.0)|
| 0:33:56| in describing the limited nature of the merit board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2036.0)|
| 0:33:59| relative to these functions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2039.0)|
| 0:34:01| that the civil service system was tasked with recruiting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2041.0)|
| 0:34:04| testifying, certifying, and protecting employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2044.0)|
| 0:34:07| of the city of Knoxville against arbitrary political activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2047.0)|
| 0:34:11| not wholesale discrimination, but arbitrary political activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2051.0)|
| 0:34:15| And then secondly, as the charter review commission noted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2055.0)|
| 0:34:19| this ordinance was designed to establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2059.0)|
| 0:34:22| with the executive branch of the government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2062.0)|
| 0:34:24| a personnel system to ensure a sound and equitable system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2064.0)|
| 0:34:27| in relation to wages, hours, working conditions, so forth, so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2067.0)|
| 0:34:30| all other aspects of maintaining a large personnel operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2070.0)|
| 0:34:34| So by the charter revision commission's own admission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2074.0)|
| 0:34:37| from the drafting of what would become article 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2077.0)|
| 0:34:40| the civil service merit board was never meant to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2080.0)|
| 0:34:43| any additional powers beyond what's stated here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2083.0)|
| 0:34:46| recruiting, testifying, certifying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2086.0)|
| 0:34:48| and protecting employees against arbitrary political activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2088.0)|
| 0:34:52| All else was left to the executive branch and the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2092.0)|
| 0:34:56| This ordinance ultimately failed, however, or I say ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2096.0)|
| 0:35:00| The ordinance allowed a referendum to go to the voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2100.0)|
| 0:35:03| which failed at the November election of 76,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2103.0)|
| 0:35:06| by a slim margin out of the nearly 28,000 votes that were cast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2106.0)|
| 0:35:11| but this comes back again, as we will see momentarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2111.0)|
| 0:35:14| In the meantime, city council asked the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2114.0)|
| 0:35:19| in light of the new EEO Act that had federally passed in 72,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2119.0)|
| 0:35:24| what is the process for investigating an EEOC charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2124.0)|
| 0:35:29| that may come to the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2129.0)|
| 0:35:31| And John Roach, who was the law director at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2131.0)|
| 0:35:34| offered a memorandum to city council that stated that the EEO officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2134.0)|
| 0:35:42| and the mayor solely investigated, reported, and resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2142.0)|
| 0:35:46| EEO allegations of discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2146.0)|
| 0:35:51| So that's where we stood until 1980.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2151.0)|
| 0:35:54| And then in 1980, the city is undergoing some significant changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2154.0)|
| 0:35:59| The World's Fair is looming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2159.0)|
| 0:36:01| That's going to be coming to town two years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2161.0)|
| 0:36:03| The city is actually in poor financial condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2163.0)|
| 0:36:06| The mayor at the time, Mayor Tyree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2166.0)|
| 0:36:08| had openly supported sales and property tax increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2168.0)|
| 0:36:10| that were unpopular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2170.0)|
| 0:36:12| Layoffs had been discussed, which made city employees quite nervous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2172.0)|
| 0:36:17| and the City Employees League, predominantly, was quite unhappy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2177.0)|
| 0:36:22| They perceived the mayor to be proposing parking expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2182.0)|
| 0:36:27| not accommodating cost-of-living adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2187.0)|
| 0:36:30| They believed they were underpaid generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2190.0)|
| 0:36:33| So a whole list of grievances that a subset of city employees had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2193.0)|
| 0:36:38| and this came to a head in 1980.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2198.0)|
| 0:36:42| You can see in City Employee League speaking notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2202.0)|
| 0:36:46| here on the next slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2206.0)|
| 0:36:48| that they actually, while they had all these grievances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2208.0)|
| 0:36:51| they were not completely unanimous despite their best efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2211.0)|
| 0:36:55| So if this is difficult to read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2215.0)|
| 0:36:57| these speaking notes from the CEL state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2217.0)|
| 0:36:59| we had a subsection of league members and other city employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2219.0)|
| 0:37:02| head off in direct conflict with the majority of this organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2222.0)|
| 0:37:05| This will not be tolerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2225.0)|
| 0:37:08| So again, the CEL is trying to organize against the initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2228.0)|
| 0:37:13| it believes that the mayor and city council are beginning to undertake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2233.0)|
| 0:37:17| and they're generally displeased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2237.0)|
| 0:37:19| Adding fuel to the fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2239.0)|
| 0:37:21| Mayor Tyree at the same time had proposed an administrative code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2241.0)|
| 0:37:24| to reorganize and clarify the departmental structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2244.0)|
| 0:37:28| of many city departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2248.0)|
| 0:37:30| This was viewed by the City Employees League with suspicion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2250.0)|
| 0:37:33| and they actively discussed even lawyering up to sue the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2253.0)|
| 0:37:38| This dispute continued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2258.0)|
| 0:37:40| and ultimately the CEL began lobbying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2260.0)|
| 0:37:43| for a stronger Civil Service Merit Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2263.0)|
| 0:37:46| and the CEL ended up recycling that 1976 ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2266.0)|
| 0:37:51| from the Charter Review Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2271.0)|
| 0:37:53| that original language from what became Article 10 of the Charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2273.0)|
| 0:37:56| and they began pushing for that language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2276.0)|
| 0:37:59| with expanded Civil Service Merit Board authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2279.0)|
| 0:38:02| Again, you can see from these notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2282.0)|
| 0:38:05| the CEL has been discussing in their minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2285.0)|
| 0:38:08| go for charter changes, not ordinance, as far as wages go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2288.0)|
| 0:38:11| Everyone said they thought we should support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2291.0)|
| 0:38:13| the Civil Service Board and the colonel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2293.0)|
| 0:38:15| It should be separate, not under the mayor and Ricker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2295.0)|
| 0:38:18| Those positions refer to Colonel Phelps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2298.0)|
| 0:38:20| who was the executive secretary of the Civil Service Board at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2300.0)|
| 0:38:23| the mayor, and then William Ricker, who was the COO of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2303.0)|
| 0:38:27| As I mentioned, they're building on the original language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2307.0)|
| 0:38:32| proposed in 1976 for a charter revision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2312.0)|
| 0:38:35| but there were two additions that they really pushed for at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2315.0)|
| 0:38:40| and these were the EEO provisions that we now see in 1003 F8 and F11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2320.0)|
| 0:38:45| as you can see that I've highlighted here below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2325.0)|
| 0:38:47| As they had phrased them at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2327.0)|
| 0:38:49| they requested that the Merit Board be given additional powers and duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2329.0)|
| 0:38:53| to hear actions regarding discrimination broadly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2333.0)|
| 0:38:56| and to provide for, not develop a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2336.0)|
| 0:38:59| but provide for equal employment opportunity of all applicants and employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2339.0)|
| 0:39:04| Nevertheless, city council did not go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2344.0)|
| 0:39:07| They approved Mayor Tyree's administrative code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2347.0)|
| 0:39:11| and part of that created an EEO division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2351.0)|
| 0:39:15| that reported directly to the director of personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2355.0)|
| 0:39:18| At that time, the personnel department in today's parlance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2358.0)|
| 0:39:22| would have been the HR department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2362.0)|
| 0:39:24| This was the original iteration of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2364.0)|
| 0:39:26| So, again, via city council action and ordinance 08580,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2366.0)|
| 0:39:31| equal employment opportunity was enforced through an EEO officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2371.0)|
| 0:39:34| that was in the equivalent of HR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2374.0)|
| 0:39:38| This, the next ordinance that city council passed that related to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2378.0)|
| 0:39:44| was, again, just to restructure the EEO officer position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2384.0)|
| 0:39:48| to be the head of a division of personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2388.0)|
| 0:39:50| and as you can see, as I've highlighted in this org chart from 1980,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2390.0)|
| 0:39:53| you have civil service office on one side with the civil service board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2393.0)|
| 0:39:57| and then personnel and EEO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2397.0)|
| 0:39:59| in a completely separate section of the organizational chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2399.0)|
| 0:40:02| So here's the point of this getting up to 1980.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2402.0)|
| 0:40:06| Until this time, the mayor, the EEO officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2406.0)|
| 0:40:11| and the personnel department, or HR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2411.0)|
| 0:40:13| solely enforced EEO protections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2413.0)|
| 0:40:16| and resolved complaints of discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2416.0)|
| 0:40:19| But there was a push from this segment of employees in the CEL| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2419.0)|
| 0:40:23| to expand and strengthen the merit board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2423.0)|
| 0:40:25| and although that proposal included additional powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2425.0)|
| 0:40:29| relating to EEO functions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2429.0)|
| 0:40:32| that was not the basis for their grievance at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2432.0)|
| 0:40:36| Their grievances were related to wages, benefits, and feared layoffs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2436.0)|
| 0:40:40| not any argument that there were problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2440.0)|
| 0:40:44| with the EEO enforcement system as of 1980.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2444.0)|
| 0:40:49| From 1980,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2449.0)|
| 0:40:52| council approved a new Charter Revision Commission ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2452.0)|
| 0:40:58| This is what we currently have as Article 10 of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2458.0)|
| 0:41:05| It was largely what was proposed in 1976,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2465.0)|
| 0:41:08| but that language I just cited that the CEL had been proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2468.0)|
| 0:41:12| was softened a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2472.0)|
| 0:41:14| As I said earlier this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2474.0)|
| 0:41:17| 1003 F8 and 11 now only permit the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2477.0)|
| 0:41:20| to hear allegations of discrimination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2480.0)|
| 0:41:22| in hiring, transfer, and promotion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2482.0)|
| 0:41:24| as opposed to broad anti-discriminatory enforcement authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2484.0)|
| 0:41:27| and they can develop a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2487.0)|
| 0:41:30| rather than providing for EEO protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2490.0)|
| 0:41:34| This ordinance permitted Article 10 to go to the voters in November of 1980,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2494.0)|
| 0:41:39| and it passed by 897 votes out of 33,500 that were cast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2499.0)|
| 0:41:46| This was reported as a surprise at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2506.0)|
| 0:41:49| I think many had suspected that this referendum would fail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2509.0)|
| 0:41:53| and that Article 10 would not become part of the city charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2513.0)|
| 0:41:56| but they were wrong. It did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2516.0)|
| 0:41:58| The result from that is the very first meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2518.0)|
| 0:42:01| of the Civil Service Merit Board in 1981| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2521.0)|
| 0:42:04| following the passage of this charter revision is complete confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2524.0)|
| 0:42:08| And that's from the board, from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2528.0)|
| 0:42:11| No one really knows exactly what Article 10 was intended to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2531.0)|
| 0:42:17| There was open discussion in this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2537.0)|
| 0:42:20| of how does the board and the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2540.0)|
| 0:42:24| go about implementing these powers and duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2544.0)|
| 0:42:26| What does it mean to develop an EEO plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2546.0)|
| 0:42:29| Who controls payroll, reclassifications, performance evaluations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2549.0)|
| 0:42:33| All of these issues were in dispute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2553.0)|
| 0:42:35| but Mayor Tyree and Attorney Robert Watson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2555.0)|
| 0:42:38| who had previously chaired the Charter Review Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2558.0)|
| 0:42:41| informed the Merit Board that these problems would be solved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2561.0)|
| 0:42:44| because they had worked out a handshake deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2564.0)|
| 0:42:47| There was an agreement between the mayor and Attorney Watson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2567.0)|
| 0:42:51| that ultimately was intended to be reduced to writing in an MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2571.0)|
| 0:42:59| I can't find any record of that MOU ever actually being reduced to writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2579.0)|
| 0:43:03| in law department records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2583.0)|
| 0:43:05| but they ended up introducing the EEO officer as a compromise position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2585.0)|
| 0:43:10| The EEO officer would be an assistant to the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2590.0)|
| 0:43:13| and an EEO officer for the Civil Service Merit Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2593.0)|
| 0:43:20| It's unclear exactly how that was ever intended to function,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2600.0)|
| 0:43:24| and city council subsequently in Ordinance 01281| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2604.0)|
| 0:43:30| amended what is now Code Chapter 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2610.0)|
| 0:43:33| to accommodate the passage of Charter Article 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2613.0)|
| 0:43:37| So that language that we've seen a few times tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2617.0)|
| 0:43:41| of who is the EEO officer shall be an appointed member of something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2621.0)|
| 0:43:45| that language is now changed in Ordinance 01281| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2625.0)|
| 0:43:49| to be an appointed member of the Civil Service Board staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2629.0)|
| 0:43:52| Again, this is an ordinance accommodating Charter Article 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2632.0)|
| 0:43:56| and incorporating the agreement that had been worked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2636.0)|
| 0:43:59| between the board and the mayor at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2639.0)|
| 0:44:02| This created additional confusion, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2642.0)|
| 0:44:04| because the EEO officer was an unclassified position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2644.0)|
| 0:44:07| within the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2647.0)|
| 0:44:09| yet simultaneously was serving as an appointed staff member of the Merit Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2649.0)|
| 0:44:14| It's unclear how this operated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2654.0)|
| 0:44:16| but the point is that the EEO officer, that position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2656.0)|
| 0:44:20| not the Civil Service Merit Board generally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2660.0)|
| 0:44:22| enforced EEO protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2662.0)|
| 0:44:26| Fast forwarding to June of 81, to further emphasize this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2666.0)|
| 0:44:31| the EEO officer, the first EEO officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2671.0)|
| 0:44:34| following the Charter revision, was Earl Nash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2674.0)|
| 0:44:36| He proposed to the Merit Board sexual harassment guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2676.0)|
| 0:44:40| with examples of prohibited conduct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2680.0)|
| 0:44:42| and instead of incorporating those into Merit Board rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2682.0)|
| 0:44:46| or attempting to distribute those to the workforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2686.0)|
| 0:44:50| surprisingly the Merit Board punted altogether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2690.0)|
| 0:44:52| on the issue of sexual harassment and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2692.0)|
| 0:44:54| this is not our bailiwick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2694.0)|
| 0:44:56| This is sexual harassment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2696.0)|
| 0:44:58| This is a directive that should come from the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2698.0)|
| 0:45:00| rather than the Civil Service Merit Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2700.0)|
| 0:45:02| So with that statement from the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2702.0)|
| 0:45:05| even the EEO officer himself was confused of his responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2705.0)|
| 0:45:09| as is noted in the meeting minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2709.0)|
| 0:45:12| And this dispute carried on for actually a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2712.0)|
| 0:45:15| all the way into 1982,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2715.0)|
| 0:45:17| and the board began disputing with the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2717.0)|
| 0:45:21| regarding who is controlling the EEO officer position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2721.0)|
| 0:45:24| and ultimately Law Director Roach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2724.0)|
| 0:45:26| agreed that he fell under the mayor's control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2726.0)|
| 0:45:29| As you can see here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2729.0)|
| 0:45:30| John Roach opines that Nash was employed by the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2730.0)|
| 0:45:33| but is assigned to work with the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2733.0)|
| 0:45:35| And Roach's opinions on these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2735.0)|
| 0:45:37| are also particularly instructive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2737.0)|
| 0:45:39| because he was the chair of the Charter Revision Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2739.0)|
| 0:45:42| that actually drafted what became Article 10 of the Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2742.0)|
| 0:45:45| And his position was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2745.0)|
| 0:45:48| this is an EEO officer that is employed by the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2748.0)|
| 0:45:51| reports to the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2751.0)|
| 0:45:52| but can work with the Civil Service Merit Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2752.0)|
| 0:45:56| Ultimately, the EEO officer resigned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2756.0)|
| 0:46:00| and that prompted additional confusion and concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2760.0)|
| 0:46:05| in that the Merit Board asserted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2765.0)|
| 0:46:08| that even without an EEO officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2768.0)|
| 0:46:11| the board was still going to enforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2771.0)|
| 0:46:13| and operate the city's EEO program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2773.0)|
| 0:46:16| Mayor Tyree did not have any clear objection to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2776.0)|
| 0:46:20| but the Executive Secretary of the board, Colonel Phelps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2780.0)|
| 0:46:24| requested a Law Director opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2784.0)|
| 0:46:26| on whether the Merit Board could enforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2786.0)|
| 0:46:28| the city's affirmative action goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2788.0)|
| 0:46:31| And this opinion from January 3rd of 1983,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2791.0)|
| 0:46:34| perhaps the most instructive opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2794.0)|
| 0:46:36| again from the author of Charter Article 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2796.0)|
| 0:46:39| citing that article of the Charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2799.0)|
| 0:46:42| Attorney Roach and another attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2802.0)|
| 0:46:45| in the city law department at that time, Charlie Sturkey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2805.0)|
| 0:46:47| concluded no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2807.0)|
| 0:46:49| The Merit Board is without authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2809.0)|
| 0:46:51| to enforce city affirmative action goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2811.0)|
| 0:46:55| The Merit Board was unsatisfied with this position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2815.0)|
| 0:47:00| and continued to attempt to undertake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2820.0)|
| 0:47:04| its own EEO enforcement measures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2824.0)|
| 0:47:07| ultimately by dubiously hiring its,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2827.0)|
| 0:47:10| the board hired its own employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2830.0)|
| 0:47:12| that they termed an EEO administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2832.0)|
| 0:47:14| instead of an officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2834.0)|
| 0:47:16| And again, the legal opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2836.0)|
| 0:47:19| that the board received at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2839.0)|
| 0:47:21| were that that position, if it is a position of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2841.0)|
| 0:47:25| does not have enforcement authority over EEO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2845.0)|
| 0:47:30| And this demonstrates historically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2850.0)|
| 0:47:33| what I think is a sticking point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2853.0)|
| 0:47:36| that legal opinions that the Merit Board has received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2856.0)|
| 0:47:40| have consistently informed the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2860.0)|
| 0:47:43| that the board can monitor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2863.0)|
| 0:47:45| the board can review certain city personnel actions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2865.0)|
| 0:47:49| but it does not have enforcement power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2869.0)|
| 0:47:51| And that is from the plain language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2871.0)|
| 0:47:53| of Charter Article 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2873.0)|
| 0:47:56| Again, however, the Merit Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2876.0)|
| 0:47:58| disregarded this legal advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2878.0)|
| 0:48:00| hired their own EEO administrator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2880.0)|
| 0:48:02| actually, as a fun aside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2882.0)|
| 0:48:05| in overt violation of the Open Meetings Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2885.0)|
| 0:48:07| they kicked the media out of the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2887.0)|
| 0:48:09| told this individual what he's supposed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2889.0)|
| 0:48:12| and then invited the media to come back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2892.0)|
| 0:48:14| So they had to rehire him in a subsequent public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2894.0)|
| 0:48:16| that was not in violation of the Open Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2896.0)|
| 0:48:19| But ultimately, the legal opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2899.0)|
| 0:48:22| that the board received carried the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2902.0)|
| 0:48:24| and the Merit Board agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2904.0)|
| 0:48:26| that the EEO administrator did not have enforcement authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2906.0)|
| 0:48:30| That instead, they hired an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2910.0)|
| 0:48:33| to only use the powers of persuasion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2913.0)|
| 0:48:36| to encourage the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2916.0)|
| 0:48:38| to adopt EEO initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2918.0)|
| 0:48:41| that the board may request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2921.0)|
| 0:48:45| There is still, as you can see here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2925.0)|
| 0:48:48| a dispute regarding who controlled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2928.0)|
| 0:48:50| who employed this employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2930.0)|
| 0:48:52| but the mayor did not fight at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2932.0)|
| 0:48:56| Fast forward to 84.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2936.0)|
| 0:48:58| We are now under the Testerman administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2938.0)|
| 0:49:01| Mayor Testerman enters office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2941.0)|
| 0:49:03| with his own desire to revise the administrative code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2943.0)|
| 0:49:06| and immediately disagrees with the Merit Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2946.0)|
| 0:49:09| specifically on EEO enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2949.0)|
| 0:49:12| As is noted in these meeting minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2952.0)|
| 0:49:14| Mayor Testerman had concluded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2954.0)|
| 0:49:16| that the EEO functions as currently established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2956.0)|
| 0:49:20| were cumbersome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2960.0)|
| 0:49:21| EEO positions cannot set policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2961.0)|
| 0:49:24| This is a responsibility of the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2964.0)|
| 0:49:27| so they should be able to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2967.0)|
| 0:49:29| and instead, any position that the board has hired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2969.0)|
| 0:49:32| should be in a monitoring capacity only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2972.0)|
| 0:49:36| City Council agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2976.0)|
| 0:49:38| City Council defunded the EEO administrator position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2978.0)|
| 0:49:42| that the Merit Board had hired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2982.0)|
| 0:49:44| and then Mayor Testerman proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2984.0)|
| 0:49:46| and actually ended up putting Bob Booker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2986.0)|
| 0:49:48| who was an administrative assistant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2988.0)|
| 0:49:50| in the personnel department, or again, HR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2990.0)|
| 0:49:53| as the new EEO officer for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2993.0)|
| 0:49:56| The Merit Board initially cooperated with this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2996.0)|
| 0:50:00| but then did an about-face in June of 1984,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3000.0)|
| 0:50:03| called a special called meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3003.0)|
| 0:50:05| and then considered taking legal action against the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3005.0)|
| 0:50:09| but ultimately relented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3009.0)|
| 0:50:11| and agreed to the abolishment of the EEO administrator position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3011.0)|
| 0:50:17| And the last step in the saga here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3017.0)|
| 0:50:20| is really Ordinance No. 15084| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3020.0)|
| 0:50:24| that, again, clarified that as a duty of the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3024.0)|
| 0:50:29| as an employee of the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3029.0)|
| 0:50:32| the EEO officer will end up enforcing EEO functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3032.0)|
| 0:50:37| but will do so in conjunction with the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3037.0)|
| 0:50:40| relative to issuing a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3040.0)|
| 0:50:43| So this emphasizes the developmental nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3043.0)|
| 0:50:46| of the board's role when it comes to EEO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3046.0)|
| 0:50:49| but the enforcement nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3049.0)|
| 0:50:51| of the mayor and the administration's role relative to EEO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3051.0)|
| 0:50:54| And at that point, the trail grows cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3054.0)|
| 0:50:58| The Civil Service Merit Board ended up moving on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3058.0)|
| 0:51:01| and there were not any further disputes of the magnitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3061.0)|
| 0:51:04| at least as seen here in the early 80s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3064.0)|
| 0:51:07| as the charter was revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3067.0)|
| 0:51:10| So again, that's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3070.0)|
| 0:51:13| To summarize the key observations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3073.0)|
| 0:51:15| from all of that historical saga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3075.0)|
| 0:51:18| before 81, EEO functions were uniformly performed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3078.0)|
| 0:51:23| by the city administration without any Merit Board involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3083.0)|
| 0:51:26| In 81, with the addition of Charter Article 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3086.0)|
| 0:51:30| that came about due to disgruntled employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3090.0)|
| 0:51:34| but without any clear reference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3094.0)|
| 0:51:36| to any problem or concern with EEO enforcement at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3096.0)|
| 0:51:41| That immediately prompted confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3101.0)|
| 0:51:44| and there were repeated disputes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3104.0)|
| 0:51:47| between the Merit Board and the city administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3107.0)|
| 0:51:49| about who would enforce EEO functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3109.0)|
| 0:51:52| But when those disputes arose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3112.0)|
| 0:51:54| the legal opinions that were uniformly provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3114.0)|
| 0:51:57| including from the drafters of Article 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3117.0)|
| 0:51:59| consistently advised that the Merit Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3119.0)|
| 0:52:01| could not enforce EEO protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3121.0)|
| 0:52:04| And unfortunately, these opinions were not often understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3124.0)|
| 0:52:08| or were sometimes disregarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3128.0)|
| 0:52:10| And again, this is not a criticism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3130.0)|
| 0:52:12| of any particular division of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3132.0)|
| 0:52:15| This is, I think, to the extent it is a criticism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3135.0)|
| 0:52:18| it's from everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3138.0)|
| 0:52:20| There were multiple opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3140.0)|
| 0:52:22| for the city administration to correct the disputes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3142.0)|
| 0:52:26| to clarify exactly who or what subset of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3146.0)|
| 0:52:30| was responsible for EEO enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3150.0)|
| 0:52:32| and for probably myriad reasons, never did so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3152.0)|
| 0:52:37| And so this dispute was able to linger for multiple years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3157.0)|
| 0:52:41| So what that tells us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3161.0)|
| 0:52:43| in moving on to this third section of the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3163.0)|
| 0:52:46| is that there is an answer from the Charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3166.0)|
| 0:52:50| by the drafters of the Charter, of who is to enforce EEO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3170.0)|
| 0:52:54| And pursuant to our Charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3174.0)|
| 0:52:56| that is the city administration and the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3176.0)|
| 0:53:00| Despite current code provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3180.0)|
| 0:53:02| referencing the Merit Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3182.0)|
| 0:53:03| or an executive secretary of the Merit Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3183.0)|
| 0:53:05| that is not what the Charter intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3185.0)|
| 0:53:07| and that is not what the Charter says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3187.0)|
| 0:53:09| So with the answer to that question now determined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3189.0)|
| 0:53:13| we can move on to what do other local governments do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3193.0)|
| 0:53:17| and is there anything that we can glean from those practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3197.0)|
| 0:53:20| that may be beneficial to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3200.0)|
| 0:53:23| So I worked with NTAS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3203.0)|
| 0:53:25| to survey local governments throughout the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3205.0)|
| 0:53:29| with the goal being to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3209.0)|
| 0:53:31| whether any similarly situated governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3211.0)|
| 0:53:34| met their EEO requirements in a similar manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3214.0)|
| 0:53:37| And by similarly situated, I mean governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3217.0)|
| 0:53:40| that have dual HR departments and civil service systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3220.0)|
| 0:53:43| particularly broad civil service systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3223.0)|
| 0:53:45| that cover a wide swath of the workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3225.0)|
| 0:53:48| of the governmental entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3228.0)|
| 0:53:50| And as I mentioned to kick us off this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3230.0)|
| 0:53:52| there were actually so few governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3232.0)|
| 0:53:54| that employed a system similar to what the city does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3234.0)|
| 0:53:57| that NTAS really struggled to complete the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3237.0)|
| 0:54:01| But they did and they did an admiral job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3241.0)|
| 0:54:03| And there were actually even fewer governmental entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3243.0)|
| 0:54:08| that maintained such broad civil service boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3248.0)|
| 0:54:11| and HR departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3251.0)|
| 0:54:13| In Tennessee alone, there are only nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3253.0)|
| 0:54:15| with populations greater than 10,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3255.0)|
| 0:54:17| that have civil service systems at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3257.0)|
| 0:54:19| And these systems are not standardized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3259.0)|
| 0:54:21| as you might expect, whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3261.0)|
| 0:54:23| This is a list of the local governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3263.0)|
| 0:54:25| that NTAS surveyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3265.0)|
| 0:54:27| As you can see from a pretty wide geographic area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3267.0)|
| 0:54:31| all of NTAS's findings are included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3271.0)|
| 0:54:34| as one of the many appendices to this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3274.0)|
| 0:54:37| So by all means, you are invited to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3277.0)|
| 0:54:40| and look at the individual policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3280.0)|
| 0:54:42| the individual ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3282.0)|
| 0:54:45| and other governing document requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3285.0)|
| 0:54:47| from these local governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3287.0)|
| 0:54:49| that set up their EEO system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3289.0)|
| 0:54:53| I've also provided in the report in section three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3293.0)|
| 0:54:56| which I will...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3296.0)|
| 0:54:58| You'll be happy to hear I will not thoroughly discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3298.0)|
| 0:55:00| every one of these governmental entities tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3300.0)|
| 0:55:03| But they are summarized in section three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3303.0)|
| 0:55:06| of the body of the written report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3306.0)|
| 0:55:08| And the takeaways here are that EEO functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3308.0)|
| 0:55:11| are almost uniformly performed and enforced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3311.0)|
| 0:55:14| by HR departments within these governmental entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3314.0)|
| 0:55:18| with the advice of legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3318.0)|
| 0:55:21| These HR departments typically have individual staff members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3321.0)|
| 0:55:25| who are designated to review specific types of complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3325.0)|
| 0:55:29| depending on whether those are discrimination complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3329.0)|
| 0:55:31| harassment complaints, reasonable accommodation requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3331.0)|
| 0:55:33| what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3333.0)|
| 0:55:35| And some HR departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3335.0)|
| 0:55:37| particularly of larger governmental entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3337.0)|
| 0:55:39| even have specific positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3339.0)|
| 0:55:41| that are designated to oversee all EEO compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3341.0)|
| 0:55:46| from a big-picture standpoint within that governmental entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3346.0)|
| 0:55:50| Importantly, of the governments surveyed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3350.0)|
| 0:55:52| none of them utilized a zero-tolerance policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3352.0)|
| 0:55:55| for discrimination or harassment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3355.0)|
| 0:55:58| My speculation is, as I've included in this report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3358.0)|
| 0:56:01| based on EEOC guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3361.0)|
| 0:56:03| zero-tolerance policies are ill-advised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3363.0)|
| 0:56:06| pursuant to the federal EEOC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3366.0)|
| 0:56:08| So my suspicion is that's why these governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3368.0)|
| 0:56:10| do not utilize zero-tolerance policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3370.0)|
| 0:56:13| But this is a term that I used in this last point here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3373.0)|
| 0:56:17| in point number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3377.0)|
| 0:56:18| Some HR departments operate as what I call clearinghouses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3378.0)|
| 0:56:22| where every complaint, every allegation of any sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3382.0)|
| 0:56:26| that falls under a category of EEO protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3386.0)|
| 0:56:31| goes to the HR department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3391.0)|
| 0:56:33| and the HR department serves as a clearinghouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3393.0)|
| 0:56:36| of those complaints to handle and resolve them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3396.0)|
| 0:56:40| if that's what the HR department has the authority to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3400.0)|
| 0:56:43| or to kick that to a different area of the city or the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3403.0)|
| 0:56:47| if the HR department does not have the authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3407.0)|
| 0:56:51| So, again, I term that a clearinghouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3411.0)|
| 0:56:54| And based on all of this data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3414.0)|
| 0:56:58| the current practices of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3418.0)|
| 0:57:01| and historically what the city is authorized to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3421.0)|
| 0:57:04| by its governing documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3424.0)|
| 0:57:06| I have a few recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3426.0)|
| 0:57:08| And, again, I will go through these quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3428.0)|
| 0:57:11| but they are set forth in considerably more detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3431.0)|
| 0:57:14| in the written report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3434.0)|
| 0:57:16| The concerns that the city currently has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3436.0)|
| 0:57:19| is that the EEO program is scattered and self-contradictory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3439.0)|
| 0:57:22| as we've discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3442.0)|
| 0:57:24| The multiple departments and job titles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3444.0)|
| 0:57:27| that are involved with enforcing EEO, as currently stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3447.0)|
| 0:57:31| demonstrates that Code Chapter 15 is inoperative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3451.0)|
| 0:57:35| as it is currently written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3455.0)|
| 0:57:37| Even though the executive secretary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3457.0)|
| 0:57:39| is tasked with investigating any discrimination complaint by code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3459.0)|
| 0:57:43| that is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3463.0)|
| 0:57:47| What happens in practice is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3467.0)|
| 0:57:48| depending on the nature of the complaint or allegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3468.0)|
| 0:57:51| it goes to potentially a very different area of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3471.0)|
| 0:57:57| And we've already talked about the scattered nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3477.0)|
| 0:57:59| of where these various positions are located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3479.0)|
| 0:58:02| so I think we can move on to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3482.0)|
| 0:58:07| To ease the burden on employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3487.0)|
| 0:58:10| and to ensure that we are maximizing our efficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3490.0)|
| 0:58:15| in human resources, as is required by charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3495.0)|
| 0:58:19| I recommend that we consolidate, the city consolidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3499.0)|
| 0:58:23| EEO functions into the HR department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3503.0)|
| 0:58:27| This scattered nature of responsibility, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3507.0)|
| 0:58:30| likely arose because of the historical lack of an HR department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3510.0)|
| 0:58:35| after the personnel department was abolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3515.0)|
| 0:58:38| Because of that, there was no better place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3518.0)|
| 0:58:41| from a pragmatic standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3521.0)|
| 0:58:43| for city administrations to put EEO compliance and enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3523.0)|
| 0:58:48| than the civil service department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3528.0)|
| 0:58:50| So while there was not a charter authority for those functions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3530.0)|
| 0:58:55| it was a convenient fit for the civil service department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3535.0)|
| 0:58:59| to perform those functions at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3539.0)|
| 0:59:02| Now, with the reestablishment of the HR department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3542.0)|
| 0:59:05| the city has a better way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3545.0)|
| 0:59:07| as is demonstrated and corroborated by the benchmark survey results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3547.0)|
| 0:59:12| Moving EEO enforcement functions to HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3552.0)|
| 0:59:17| produces numerous benefits for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3557.0)|
| 0:59:21| The first is organizational efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3561.0)|

| 0:59:25| HR can, as I discussed, can examine any complaint that comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3565.0)|
| 0:59:31| resolve it itself, if possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3571.0)|
| 0:59:33| or kick it to another division of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3573.0)|
| 0:59:35| potentially the civil service merit board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3575.0)|
| 0:59:37| if the complaint arises out of a power and duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3577.0)|
| 0:59:41| of some other subset of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3581.0)|
| 0:59:43| This also would foster communication, interdepartmentally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3583.0)|
| 0:59:49| in that every department of the city would know where to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3589.0)|
| 0:59:52| if an employee has a particular concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3592.0)|
| 0:59:55| about an EEO potentially discrimination complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3595.0)|
| 1:00:00| but also it fosters communications between employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3600.0)|
| 1:00:04| their department heads, and ultimately HR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3604.0)|
| 1:00:07| because instead of having to work through that maze| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3607.0)|
| 1:00:09| of administrative rules and code provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3609.0)|
| 1:00:12| that could send employees in 15 different directions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3612.0)|
| 1:00:14| depending on what their complaint may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3614.0)|
| 1:00:16| they know they're going to take it to HR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3616.0)|
| 1:00:18| Regardless of what it is, it's going to go to HR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3618.0)|
| 1:00:21| and then HR will either sort it out or send it where it needs to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3621.0)|
| 1:00:24| This would also foster investigatory accuracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3624.0)|
| 1:00:28| Instead of having numerous individuals perform investigations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3628.0)|
| 1:00:34| fortunately on an infrequent basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3634.0)|
| 1:00:37| investigations that invoked HR authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3637.0)|
| 1:00:41| would be performed by HR with HR analysts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3641.0)|
| 1:00:43| who are trained specifically in those federal and state EEO protections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3643.0)|
| 1:00:49| and in the investigatory procedures that the city adopts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3649.0)|
| 1:00:53| This inherently would maximize the effectiveness of those investigations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3653.0)|
| 1:00:59| the accuracy of those investigations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3659.0)|
| 1:01:02| and it would foster accountability in that instead of, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3662.0)|
| 1:01:06| having numerous individuals who are all equally assigned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3666.0)|
| 1:01:09| with certain duties to protect EEO functions, it's in one place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3669.0)|
| 1:01:13| So if someone drops the ball, we know where it occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3673.0)|
| 1:01:17| It would be the HR department if there's ever a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3677.0)|
| 1:01:21| So how do we get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3681.0)|
| 1:01:23| What can the city do to actually effectuate this consolidated EEO approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3683.0)|
| 1:01:28| The first step is to revise the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3688.0)|
| 1:01:33| With the reestablishment of the HR department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3693.0)|
| 1:01:36| the need for Section 1553's placement of the enforcing officer position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3696.0)|
| 1:01:42| with the executive secretary of the Civil Service Merit Board is moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3702.0)|
| 1:01:46| That is an inoperative provision anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3706.0)|
| 1:01:49| but it is now completely moot from a legal standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3709.0)|
| 1:01:53| Because of the additional functions that will be required by the HR department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3713.0)|
| 1:01:59| to meet all of these EEO needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3719.0)|
| 1:02:01| it would be advisable in my estimation to consider allocating additional resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3721.0)|
| 1:02:05| to the HR department to ensure that they have the resources they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3725.0)|
| 1:02:08| to be able to perform all of these different functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3728.0)|
| 1:02:12| Ideally, that could be in a deputy director position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3732.0)|
| 1:02:16| or some other specific position within HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3736.0)|
| 1:02:19| that is formally designated as the EEO enforcing officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3739.0)|
| 1:02:26| for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3746.0)|
| 1:02:28| This would then meet the extensive enforcement requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3748.0)|
| 1:02:32| that could remain in Code Section 15-54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3752.0)|
| 1:02:35| And this position would then supervise all EEO-focused positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3755.0)|
| 1:02:40| throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3760.0)|
| 1:02:42| It would include whatever position or individuals would be designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3762.0)|
| 1:02:47| to be the Title VI and ADA coordinators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3767.0)|
| 1:02:50| Code Section 15-56 we have not talked a whole lot about tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3770.0)|
| 1:02:55| but that is a duplicative investigatory section of city code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3775.0)|
| 1:03:00| It's outdated, and it's actually legally unenforceable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3780.0)|
| 1:03:04| in my estimation as it currently reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3784.0)|
| 1:03:06| It contains certain confidentiality provisions that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3786.0)|
| 1:03:10| in light of the Public Records Act that the city is bound by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3790.0)|
| 1:03:13| the city could not meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3793.0)|
| 1:03:15| It also requires any individual who violates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3795.0)|
| 1:03:20| any of these confidentiality provisions in Section 15-56| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3800.0)|
| 1:03:24| to be immediately dismissed, which raises concerns about due process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3804.0)|
| 1:03:29| and civil service protections if they're a classified employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3809.0)|
| 1:03:33| So because we have similar and more detailed investigatory procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3813.0)|
| 1:03:40| already set forth in administrative rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3820.0)|
| 1:03:42| and in Civil Service Merit Board rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3822.0)|
| 1:03:44| Code Section 15-56, again, is duplicative and inoperative on its face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3824.0)|
| 1:03:49| and should be repealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3829.0)|
| 1:03:52| Also in Code Sections 2-111, 2-1057, and 2-1059,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3832.0)|
| 1:03:59| these code sections all relate to what is termed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3839.0)|
| 1:04:02| the Office of Community Relations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3842.0)|
| 1:04:04| These code sections should also be revised to not only incorporate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3844.0)|
| 1:04:10| if desired, the current functions and duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3850.0)|
| 1:04:13| that the Community Empowerment Department, as it's now termed, performs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3853.0)|
| 1:04:18| but to accommodate the movement of EEO enforcement functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3858.0)|
| 1:04:23| to the HR Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3863.0)|
| 1:04:25| Those last two code provisions are just housekeeping measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3865.0)|
| 1:04:31| based on references that are made to certain DBE initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3871.0)|
| 1:04:38| certification, and proportional allocation requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3878.0)|
| 1:04:43| that are presently performed by the Purchasing Division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3883.0)|
| 1:04:45| within the Department of Finance and Accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3885.0)|
| 1:04:48| So removing references to the Office of Community Relations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3888.0)|
| 1:04:51| from those last two code provisions would be a housekeeping measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3891.0)|
| 1:04:54| to just clarify where those functions are currently performed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3894.0)|
| 1:04:59| Code Section 2-392, this is the HR Department code provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3899.0)|
| 1:05:05| Again, as a piggybacking measure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3905.0)|
| 1:05:08| this section of code should also be revised to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3908.0)|
| 1:05:12| that now the HR Department will be tasked with administering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3912.0)|
| 1:05:15| and enforcing the City's Equal Employment Opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3915.0)|
| 1:05:18| and Anti-Discrimination Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3918.0)|
| 1:05:20| and then to ensure that we are complying with our charter requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3920.0)|
| 1:05:25| under Charter Article 10-1003-F8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3925.0)|
| 1:05:29| I would recommend that the City adopt a code provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3929.0)|
| 1:05:33| that requires the HR Department notify the Civil Service Merit Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3933.0)|
| 1:05:37| if HR receives a complaint that invokes what is clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3937.0)|
| 1:05:41| a power and duty of the Civil Service Merit Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3941.0)|
| 1:05:44| which is to hear allegations of discrimination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3944.0)|
| 1:05:46| in hiring, transfer, and promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3946.0)|
| 1:05:49| The EEO position within HR should expressly include responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3949.0)|
| 1:05:55| for Title VI compliance, including a formalized list of functions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3955.0)|
| 1:05:59| and the Title VI compliance plan and the Title VI complaint procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3959.0)|
| 1:06:03| is not widely known, I don't think, among the city workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3963.0)|
| 1:06:10| This should be revised to ensure that it is housed in the HR Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3970.0)|
| 1:06:16| and also ultimately included with city administrative rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3976.0)|
| 1:06:20| so that city employees can easily find these provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3980.0)|
| 1:06:25| that may affect any complaints relative to EEO functionality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3985.0)|
| 1:06:34| The last few recommendations regarding consolidation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3994.0)|
| 1:06:39| are that the ADA coordinator and any ADA coordinator staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3999.0)|
| 1:06:43| should gradually be reorganized within the Department of HR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4003.0)|
| 1:06:47| This one would require a little more effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4007.0)|
| 1:06:50| and for that reason I've stated that it should be a gradual move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4010.0)|
| 1:06:53| because the ADA is such an expansive law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4013.0)|
| 1:06:56| The ADA has categorical functions that extend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4016.0)|
| 1:07:00| into many different departments throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4020.0)|
| 1:07:03| so that would take a little more time to ensure that the HR Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4023.0)|
| 1:07:06| with everything else that would be moving its direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4026.0)|
| 1:07:09| would have the capacity and the resources to be able to accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4029.0)|
| 1:07:12| that move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4032.0)|
| 1:07:14| But fortunately, my recommendation is that the ADA coordinator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4034.0)|
| 1:07:18| ultimately become an actual coordinator position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4038.0)|
| 1:07:22| instead of what it currently is, which is the first line of defense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4042.0)|
| 1:07:26| for any complaint that comes in from the city workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4046.0)|
| 1:07:31| Instead of having to investigate, resolve any complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4051.0)|
| 1:07:36| deal with all reasonable accommodation requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4056.0)|
| 1:07:40| resolve any sort of or opine on any sort of engineering concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4060.0)|
| 1:07:44| from an ADA standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4064.0)|
| 1:07:46| the ADA coordinator could serve in a coordinator capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4066.0)|
| 1:07:49| and the existing or additional HR analysts within the HR Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4069.0)|
| 1:07:54| could assist in performing some of those widely differing ADA responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4074.0)|
| 1:08:00| Through administrative rule revisions, as I stated earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4080.0)|
| 1:08:07| HR should be the clearinghouse of all EEO-related complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4087.0)|
| 1:08:11| so employees know exactly where to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4091.0)|
| 1:08:13| regardless of what their complaint may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4093.0)|
| 1:08:16| And then Code Section 15-57, which currently includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4096.0)|
| 1:08:21| every protected class that is recognized by federal or state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4101.0)|
| 1:08:26| or judicial interpretation of the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4106.0)|
| 1:08:28| should be the one place in city code and in city policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4108.0)|
| 1:08:33| that our protected classes are actually referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4113.0)|
| 1:08:36| Right now we have references to many of these protected classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4116.0)|
| 1:08:42| but not all in different city policies depending on where you look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4122.0)|
| 1:08:46| and that's simply a product of changes to state and federal law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4126.0)|
| 1:08:50| and judicial interpretation over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4130.0)|
| 1:08:52| that have not worked their way into every policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4132.0)|
| 1:08:55| because some policies, like, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4135.0)|
| 1:08:57| Merit Board Article 3 has not been revised in decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4137.0)|
| 1:09:01| So to prevent any risk of not including every protected class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4141.0)|
| 1:09:06| utilizing Code Section 15-57 as the one place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4146.0)|
| 1:09:10| where all protected classes within the city are referenced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4150.0)|
| 1:09:12| would solve that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4152.0)|
| 1:09:16| Moving off of the code and moving to the administrative rules specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4156.0)|
| 1:09:19| in light of these code changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4159.0)|
| 1:09:21| the next recommendation is to revise the administrative rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4161.0)|
| 1:09:24| to ensure they are consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4164.0)|
| 1:09:26| And while there are several inconsistencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4166.0)|
| 1:09:28| as we've discussed previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4168.0)|
| 1:09:30| the big one here that I thought important to address would be ADA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4170.0)|
| 1:09:34| Administrative Rule 15 is currently the city's ADA compliance manual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4174.0)|
| 1:09:39| and this contains procedures for reasonable accommodation requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4179.0)|
| 1:09:44| that differ from Civil Service Merit Board rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4184.0)|
| 1:09:47| depending on the type of individual, be it an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4187.0)|
| 1:09:51| or an applicant for employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4191.0)|
| 1:09:53| that is requesting the reasonable accommodation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4193.0)|
| 1:09:55| again, for the benefit of employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4195.0)|
| 1:09:58| and for operational efficiencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4198.0)|
| 1:10:01| moving these functions to actually place the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4201.0)|
| 1:10:07| with the HR department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4207.0)|
| 1:10:09| will help foster a significantly simpler process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4209.0)|
| 1:10:13| for city employees to be able to have their requests heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4213.0)|
| 1:10:17| and quickly resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4217.0)|
| 1:10:19| The Reasonable Accommodation Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4219.0)|
| 1:10:22| as it is currently incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4222.0)|
| 1:10:26| has a weird provision where there are certain instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4226.0)|
| 1:10:31| where an individual or a department head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4231.0)|
| 1:10:34| who has the authority to make a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4234.0)|
| 1:10:36| relative to a reasonable accommodation request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4236.0)|
| 1:10:39| can then, if it's appealed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4239.0)|
| 1:10:42| serve on the Reasonable Accommodation Committee as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4242.0)|
| 1:10:46| That is an inadvised structure, an ill-advised structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4246.0)|
| 1:10:52| and my recommendation is to alter the constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4252.0)|
| 1:10:55| of the Reasonable Accommodation Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4255.0)|
| 1:10:57| and the administrative rules such that that situation cannot arise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4257.0)|
| 1:11:01| where, ostensibly, an employee could file an accommodation request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4261.0)|
| 1:11:04| and then have two different bodies serve as judge and juror| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4264.0)|
| 1:11:08| with at least one member being the same on both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4268.0)|
| 1:11:12| And then finally, in Administrative Rule 1501, subsection 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4272.0)|
| 1:11:16| again, from the Clearinghouse recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4276.0)|
| 1:11:19| ADA grievances would be much better served to be processed by HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4279.0)|
| 1:11:24| instead of going through the civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4284.0)|
| 1:11:26| And that also makes logical sense to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4286.0)|
| 1:11:30| in that these federal and state EEO protections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4290.0)|
| 1:11:34| ADA being a good example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4294.0)|
| 1:11:35| are not limited to classified employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4295.0)|
| 1:11:37| that occupy the civil service system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4297.0)|
| 1:11:40| These are requirements of all city employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4300.0)|
| 1:11:42| regardless of classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4302.0)|
| 1:11:44| So routing certain employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4304.0)|
| 1:11:46| who may never have any interaction with the civil service merit board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4306.0)|
| 1:11:50| because they're not classified employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4310.0)|
| 1:11:52| routing them to civil service for an ADA grievance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4312.0)|
| 1:11:55| does not make a lot of sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4315.0)|
| 1:11:57| and is not representative of what we have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4317.0)|
| 1:11:59| in our benchmark survey results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4319.0)|
| 1:12:02| And then also on the administrative rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4322.0)|
| 1:12:04| and civil service merit board rules front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4324.0)|
| 1:12:08| a final recommendation here is for the merit board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4328.0)|
| 1:12:11| actually to reexamine its own rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4331.0)|
| 1:12:14| to ensure that its rules are congruent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4334.0)|
| 1:12:17| with the functions that have been reestablished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4337.0)|
| 1:12:19| with the HR department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4339.0)|
| 1:12:24| and with these recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4344.0)|
| 1:12:25| as they end up becoming operative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4345.0)|
| 1:12:28| through revisions to city code and administrative rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4348.0)|
| 1:12:33| Finally, to clarify and reorganize the city's EEO plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4353.0)|
| 1:12:39| I'm suggesting that the city codify all EEO policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4359.0)|
| 1:12:43| into a single administrative rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4363.0)|
| 1:12:45| So again, while we may have a one-stop shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4365.0)|
| 1:12:48| in terms of an HR department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4368.0)|
| 1:12:50| for employees with EEO concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4370.0)|
| 1:12:53| the city would then have a one-stop shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4373.0)|
| 1:12:56| with the administrative rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4376.0)|
| 1:12:57| one chapter of the administrative rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4377.0)|
| 1:12:59| that's devoted to all policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4379.0)|
| 1:13:01| that invoke any EEO functionality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4381.0)|
| 1:13:05| Currently, administrative rule 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4385.0)|
| 1:13:07| is solely devoted to ADA compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4387.0)|
| 1:13:10| To me, that seems to be the natural fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4390.0)|
| 1:13:13| to move some of these administrative rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4393.0)|
| 1:13:15| that are scattered throughout 15, 16 chapters of rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4395.0)|
| 1:13:19| and put them in one place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4399.0)|
| 1:13:20| that being administrative rule chapter 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4400.0)|
| 1:13:24| Relative to administrative rules 1.06 and 1.07,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4404.0)|
| 1:13:27| these are the harassment and workplace violence policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4407.0)|
| 1:13:30| Again, those policies currently allow employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4410.0)|
| 1:13:33| to go to either civil service or law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4413.0)|
| 1:13:36| Those rules should also be revised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4416.0)|
| 1:13:38| to direct all complaints of harassment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4418.0)|
| 1:13:40| or workplace violence to HR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4420.0)|
| 1:13:42| And then specific to administrative rule 1.06,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4422.0)|
| 1:13:46| there are some excellent policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4426.0)|
| 1:13:48| as I've referenced here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4428.0)|
| 1:13:49| from Greene County and Sacramento, California,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4429.0)|
| 1:13:53| that they provide separate policy sections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4433.0)|
| 1:13:57| to really allow employees an opportunity to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4437.0)|
| 1:14:01| if they have a sexual harassment complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4441.0)|
| 1:14:04| what types and examples can be provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4444.0)|
| 1:14:07| within the policy of sexual harassment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4447.0)|
| 1:14:09| that are prohibited for the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4449.0)|
| 1:14:11| or if they have some other type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4451.0)|
| 1:14:13| of discriminatory harassment complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4453.0)|
| 1:14:15| a different section of the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4455.0)|
| 1:14:17| that, again, provides specific examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4457.0)|
| 1:14:20| of what is that type of discriminatory harassment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4460.0)|
| 1:14:24| There has been confusion in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4464.0)|
| 1:14:26| with the current policy in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4466.0)|
| 1:14:28| while the policy prohibits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4468.0)|
| 1:14:29| all forms of discriminatory harassment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4469.0)|
| 1:14:31| the bulk of the policy only discusses sexual harassment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4471.0)|
| 1:14:35| instead of other forms of discriminatory harassment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4475.0)|
| 1:14:37| So breaking those out, following a model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4477.0)|
| 1:14:39| like Greene County or Sacramento| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4479.0)|
| 1:14:41| would better provide employees clarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4481.0)|
| 1:14:43| on what exactly is prohibited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4483.0)|
| 1:14:45| and what are examples of that type of prohibited conduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4485.0)|
| 1:14:50| This administrative rule, the harassment policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4490.0)|
| 1:14:53| should also be revised to dovetail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4493.0)|
| 1:14:56| with administrative rule 1.18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4496.0)|
| 1:14:58| that's the city's social media policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4498.0)|
| 1:15:00| and the IT acceptable use policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4500.0)|
| 1:15:03| That's to ensure that no matter the medium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4503.0)|
| 1:15:06| in which an allegation of harassment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4506.0)|
| 1:15:09| or discrimination may occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4509.0)|
| 1:15:11| it is effectively prohibited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4511.0)|
| 1:15:13| and the employees are protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4513.0)|
| 1:15:15| by virtue of these two rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4515.0)|
| 1:15:17| operating in tandem with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4517.0)|
| 1:15:19| And then finally, the departmental specific policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4519.0)|
| 1:15:23| that speak of EEO protections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4523.0)|
| 1:15:25| within a particular department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4525.0)|
| 1:15:27| should also be referenced to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4527.0)|
| 1:15:29| that those types of complaints, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4529.0)|
| 1:15:31| for consistency's sake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4531.0)|
| 1:15:33| are going to the HR department as clearinghouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4533.0)|
| 1:15:35| instead of to civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4535.0)|
| 1:15:37| or to other different facets of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4537.0)|
| 1:15:40| depending on what the complaint may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4540.0)|
| 1:15:43| That is the report in a nutshell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4543.0)|
| 1:15:46| Perhaps a large nutshell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4546.0)|
| 1:15:50| It's a lot to take in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4550.0)|
| 1:15:52| and I thank you for your time and your attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4552.0)|
| 1:15:56| and I'm happy to do my best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4556.0)|
| 1:15:58| to answer any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4558.0)|
| 1:16:01| Mr. Lyon, thank you so much for walking us through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4561.0)|
| 1:16:05| I found the history of that quite interesting, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4565.0)|
| 1:16:08| as we went through all the developments over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4568.0)|
| 1:16:12| so I know that was a lot of information to give to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4572.0)|
| 1:16:16| but I do appreciate the thoroughness of your discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4576.0)|
| 1:16:20| and your presentation with us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4580.0)|
| 1:16:22| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4582.0)|
| 1:16:26| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4586.0)|
| 1:16:31| First, I'll share my concerns for transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4591.0)|
| 1:16:36| This workshop is resulting from a process started in 2021| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4596.0)|
| 1:16:49| that was based on a resolution I brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4609.0)|
| 1:16:54| My colleague here amended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4614.0)|
| 1:16:57| It was passed so that we could identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4617.0)|
| 1:17:03| what parts of our policies, our code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4623.0)|
| 1:17:08| regarding employment discrimination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4628.0)|
| 1:17:11| might need to be strengthened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4631.0)|
| 1:17:15| It's now two years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4635.0)|
| 1:17:17| This is an issue that I'm extremely committed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4637.0)|
| 1:17:21| and want to see us make progress on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4641.0)|
| 1:17:26| but to receive the materials just two days ago on Election Day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4646.0)|
| 1:17:33| does not put us in a position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4653.0)|
| 1:17:35| and obviously the majority of City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4655.0)|
| 1:17:38| was not even available tonight for this very important workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4658.0)|
| 1:17:42| So I wanted to start off with just saying I'm disappointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4662.0)|
| 1:17:45| in how we as a city are pursuing this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4665.0)|
| 1:17:49| and reading through the history that Mr. Lyons shared with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4669.0)|
| 1:17:53| it seems like more of the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4673.0)|
| 1:17:55| where we have a long history as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4675.0)|
| 1:18:00| of not dedicating the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4680.0)|
| 1:18:04| the funding needed to adequately do this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4684.0)|
| 1:18:08| We just continue to highlight a confusion that exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4688.0)|
| 1:18:14| I'm disappointed in the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4694.0)|
| 1:18:16| that have come forward because what I am seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4696.0)|
| 1:18:22| is that we're continuing to not invest the funding that we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4702.0)|
| 1:18:30| in order for this work to be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4710.0)|
| 1:18:33| One thing that has been mentioned throughout the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4713.0)|
| 1:18:41| and one question that I have, I have lots of questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4721.0)|
| 1:18:44| but there was no discussion of what investigations have taken place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4724.0)|
| 1:18:50| throughout the history of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4730.0)|
| 1:18:52| what those have looked like, were they resolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4732.0)|
| 1:18:55| who took the lead on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4735.0)|
| 1:18:56| do we have them in our historical records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4736.0)|
| 1:19:00| That's one thing that I would like to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4740.0)|
| 1:19:04| because that's something that we can learn from as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4744.0)|
| 1:19:07| I'm shocked, especially after the resolution was amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4747.0)|
| 1:19:12| to ensure that there was Civil Service Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4752.0)|
| 1:19:14| Merit Board participation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4754.0)|
| 1:19:16| that we're not hearing from the Civil Service Merit Board tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4756.0)|
| 1:19:20| and what their experience has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4760.0)|
| 1:19:23| as it relates to our Equal Employment Opportunity Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4763.0)|
| 1:19:34| I have not had a chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4774.0)|
| 1:19:36| I've had a chance to skim through the documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4776.0)|
| 1:19:39| but I have not had a chance to sit with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4779.0)|
| 1:19:41| the way I need to be able to sit with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4781.0)|
| 1:19:44| to have an informed opinion of how we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4784.0)|
| 1:19:48| Consolidating responsibilities into one office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4788.0)|
| 1:19:54| is not a terribly bad idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4794.0)|
| 1:19:57| but the HR office, the Human Resources Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4797.0)|
| 1:20:01| when previously, especially if we look at Title VI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4801.0)|
| 1:20:04| we've had that divided in the code even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4804.0)|
| 1:20:08| as pertaining to the business discrimination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4808.0)|
| 1:20:15| and personnel issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4815.0)|
| 1:20:18| And I don't even see a distinction here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4818.0)|
| 1:20:20| it's just consolidated all together into one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4820.0)|
| 1:20:23| within the HR department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4823.0)|
| 1:20:26| And the last that we've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4826.0)|
| 1:20:28| is that the Title VI responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4828.0)|
| 1:20:30| would go to the HR director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4830.0)|
| 1:20:33| So are we now hearing that there's a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4833.0)|
| 1:20:37| to bring forward a new Title VI coordinator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4837.0)|
| 1:20:40| or would all of those responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4840.0)|
| 1:20:42| still be with the HR director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4842.0)|
| 1:20:45| Because I feel like when we're talking about ADA responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4845.0)|
| 1:20:48| when we're talking about Title VI responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4848.0)|
| 1:20:50| you are absolutely correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4850.0)|
| 1:20:52| that that is a broad array of responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4852.0)|
| 1:21:01| that that has to encompass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4861.0)|
| 1:21:04| And I want to see us expand what we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4864.0)|
| 1:21:08| in terms of ADA compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4868.0)|
| 1:21:10| so that we do actually have a real ADA coordinator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4870.0)|
| 1:21:13| not someone who's actually implementing the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4873.0)|
| 1:21:15| but who is the coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4875.0)|
| 1:21:17| And we need the same for Title VI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4877.0)|
| 1:21:20| But I don't see that in the recommendations clearly stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4880.0)|
| 1:21:24| Also, you talked about codifying into the administrative rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4884.0)|
| 1:21:30| I would say we would need to codify it into an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4890.0)|
| 1:21:34| so that we don't continue to have confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4894.0)|
| 1:21:37| as new mayors come in and decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4897.0)|
| 1:21:40| administrative rules need to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4900.0)|
| 1:21:42| So if we're going to codify it, it should be in an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4902.0)|
| 1:21:45| so we have some clarity as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4905.0)|
| 1:21:50| I'm not sure what else to share tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4910.0)|
| 1:21:52| because I have a lot of reading still to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4912.0)|
| 1:21:55| but these are important responsibilities of a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4915.0)|
| 1:22:01| And I don't have any evidence that over the last 50 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4921.0)|
| 1:22:06| that we have actually been carrying out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4926.0)|
| 1:22:09| an Equal Employment Opportunity Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4929.0)|
| 1:22:13| I've seen a lot of discussion, a lot of debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4933.0)|
| 1:22:16| but I'm not seeing a program that's been carried out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4936.0)|
| 1:22:20| Have you seen any evidence of a program that's been carried out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4940.0)|
| 1:22:26| Thank you, Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4946.0)|
| 1:22:28| To respond to your last issue first, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4948.0)|
| 1:22:32| I think that's the entirety of Section 2 of this report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4952.0)|
| 1:22:36| is showing that while it may not be a cohesive program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4956.0)|
| 1:22:39| it may not be one that has always been compliant with charter authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4959.0)|
| 1:22:44| it has absolutely been a program with multiple individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4964.0)|
| 1:22:48| across many departments who have been carrying out all of these functions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4968.0)|
| 1:22:52| be they ADA, which I'll just speak to currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4972.0)|
| 1:22:57| performed within housing and neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4977.0)|
| 1:23:00| Title VI, which had until recently been performed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4980.0)|
| 1:23:03| within the Community Empowerment Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4983.0)|
| 1:23:05| and by virtue of employee turnover there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4985.0)|
| 1:23:08| has now on an interim basis moved to HR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4988.0)|
| 1:23:11| whether it's matters of sexual harassment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4991.0)|
| 1:23:15| or allegations of discrimination flowing through the city's harassment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4995.0)|
| 1:23:20| or workplace violence policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5000.0)|
| 1:23:23| that is the city's EEO plan and program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5003.0)|
| 1:23:27| And from just my personal experiences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5007.0)|
| 1:23:31| those complaints were investigated and findings were issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5011.0)|
| 1:23:36| and if there was a matter to resolve, that matter was resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5016.0)|
| 1:23:40| Now, that's not to say that there isn't room for improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5020.0)|
| 1:23:43| Obviously there is, or this report would have been a whole lot shorter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5023.0)|
| 1:23:46| but there is a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5026.0)|
| 1:23:49| it just has not been a cohesive, clearly understood plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5029.0)|
| 1:23:53| for all employees throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5033.0)|
| 1:23:56| And I think that relative to, I appreciate your comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5036.0)|
| 1:24:00| regarding consolidation being a good thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5040.0)|
| 1:24:03| I do think there is a clear delineation of function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5043.0)|
| 1:24:07| with this consolidation recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5047.0)|
| 1:24:10| where there may be an HR director or a deputy director in HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5050.0)|
| 1:24:14| who is tasked as the EEO enforcing officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5054.0)|
| 1:24:17| for accountability purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5057.0)|
| 1:24:19| So that if there's an issue that arises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5059.0)|
| 1:24:22| everyone knows who or where the buck stops with, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5062.0)|
| 1:24:26| But ultimately the HR analysts, the ADA coordinator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5066.0)|
| 1:24:29| the Title VI coordinator, all of those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5069.0)|
| 1:24:32| who may fall underneath the supervision of said EEO officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5072.0)|
| 1:24:39| would be the individuals, as you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5079.0)|
| 1:24:42| who would be actually implementing the day-to-day operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5082.0)|
| 1:24:45| of investigating and making recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5085.0)|
| 1:24:47| So it is a lot, but there are a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5087.0)|
| 1:24:50| within the HR department who are able to provide those functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5090.0)|
| 1:24:54| and I think that's why you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5094.0)|
| 1:24:56| virtually every other local governmental entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5096.0)|
| 1:24:59| that was surveyed by MTAS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5099.0)|
| 1:25:01| putting these types of activities within HR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5101.0)|
| 1:25:04| Well, and the last thing I'll say is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5104.0)|
| 1:25:06| because that point bothered me as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5106.0)|
| 1:25:08| what I've seen other cities do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5108.0)|
| 1:25:10| is to create a civil rights office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5110.0)|
| 1:25:12| and then when they expand the protections to their employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5112.0)|
| 1:25:17| it becomes a human rights office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5117.0)|
| 1:25:19| What I'm seeing is continued reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5119.0)|
| 1:25:22| We're getting rid of this community relations office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5122.0)|
| 1:25:26| which we have in our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5126.0)|
| 1:25:28| We're not even talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5128.0)|
| 1:25:30| We're wanting to move all these responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5130.0)|
| 1:25:32| to the HR department, which was just created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5132.0)|
| 1:25:34| and we keep dumping all of these responsibilities onto it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5134.0)|
| 1:25:37| It sounds like the same history that was presented to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5137.0)|
| 1:25:40| where the Civil Service Merit Board was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5140.0)|
| 1:25:42| well, do we have to have this type of program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5142.0)|
| 1:25:45| Well, if we don't have an employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5145.0)|
| 1:25:47| let's just make one of the board members do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5147.0)|
| 1:25:49| That's the same conversation that we're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5149.0)|
| 1:25:51| Who can we dump this onto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5151.0)|
| 1:25:53| rather than who are we going to put into this position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5153.0)|
| 1:25:56| that has the proper authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5156.0)|
| 1:25:58| to ensure that there is enforcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5158.0)|
| 1:26:00| Because right now we're having city employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5160.0)|
| 1:26:03| come forward with complaints that date back 30 years at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5163.0)|
| 1:26:07| that haven't been resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5167.0)|
| 1:26:09| I'll let you respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5169.0)|
| 1:26:12| I've got other lights on, so I need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5172.0)|
| 1:26:14| Yeah, I'll only say we do still have one presenter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5174.0)|
| 1:26:18| in our workshop agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5178.0)|
| 1:26:19| and that's Dr. Drummond in the HR department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5179.0)|
| 1:26:21| so I would like to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5181.0)|
| 1:26:23| that we also get to her portion of the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5183.0)|
| 1:26:25| Obviously, there may be other additional questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5185.0)|
| 1:26:27| for Mr. Lyon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5187.0)|
| 1:26:30| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5190.0)|
| 1:26:32| I'm going to turn my light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5192.0)|
| 1:26:34| I've been watching this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5194.0)|
| 1:26:36| I had another prior engagement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5196.0)|
| 1:26:38| and my apologies for being late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5198.0)|
| 1:26:40| Vice Mayor and my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5200.0)|
| 1:26:42| but I have been listening in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5202.0)|
| 1:26:44| and because I was listening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5204.0)|
| 1:26:46| I felt it was very important to try to be down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5206.0)|
| 1:26:50| As we're closing this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5210.0)|
| 1:26:52| I'd like to go ahead and turn my light off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5212.0)|
| 1:26:54| and allow Director Drummond to present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5214.0)|
| 1:26:57| and then I will turn my light back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5217.0)|
| 1:26:59| Does anyone else have any other questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5219.0)|
| 1:27:01| before we move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5221.0)|
| 1:27:03| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5223.0)|
| 1:27:05| I'll hold my question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5225.0)|
| 1:27:07| until after Dr. Drummond has presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5227.0)|
| 1:27:10| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5230.0)|
| 1:27:12| Dr. Drummond, we'll move on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5232.0)|
| 1:27:15| to your part of the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5235.0)|
| 1:27:17| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5237.0)|
| 1:27:18| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5238.0)|
| 1:27:20| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5240.0)|
| 1:27:21| I realize that this has been lengthy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5241.0)|
| 1:27:23| so I'll be pretty quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5243.0)|
| 1:27:24| as we move on to the implementation process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5244.0)|
| 1:27:27| and I want to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5247.0)|
| 1:27:29| As we think about the staffing piece of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5249.0)|
| 1:27:32| I believe that the HR department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5252.0)|
| 1:27:35| does have the staffing capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5255.0)|
| 1:27:37| to ensure that each part of this is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5257.0)|
| 1:27:40| What I will tell you is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5260.0)|
| 1:27:42| as we look at each of these pieces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5262.0)|
| 1:27:44| looking at Title VI, Title VII, and Title I of the ADA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5264.0)|
| 1:27:49| I believe that the HR department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5269.0)|
| 1:27:51| has the capacity to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5271.0)|
| 1:27:53| and to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5273.0)|
| 1:27:55| We will have a total of four HR analysts, generalists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5275.0)|
| 1:27:59| that will be trained to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5279.0)|
| 1:28:02| that we are implementing this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5282.0)|
| 1:28:05| From the Title VI process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5285.0)|
| 1:28:07| we will make sure that we have staff trained as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5287.0)|
| 1:28:10| The HR department has the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5290.0)|
| 1:28:12| for a total of nine employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5292.0)|
| 1:28:14| and has the capacity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5294.0)|
| 1:28:17| And I also want to make sure that I state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5297.0)|
| 1:28:20| that we believe in the Civil Service Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5300.0)|
| 1:28:24| and that any matter that deals with hiring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5304.0)|
| 1:28:27| transfers, or promotions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5307.0)|
| 1:28:29| will be directed to the Civil Service Merit Board as required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5309.0)|
| 1:28:34| So we want to make sure that the information is transparent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5314.0)|
| 1:28:38| and we're getting that information out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5318.0)|
| 1:28:40| Please go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5320.0)|
| 1:28:41| As we look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5321.0)|
| 1:28:42| I want to make sure that you understand the goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5322.0)|
| 1:28:44| and I want to specifically address at one point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5324.0)|
| 1:28:48| the time frame in looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5328.0)|
| 1:28:51| We believe that this is a pathway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5331.0)|
| 1:28:54| that will allow for everyone to have consistent information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5334.0)|
| 1:29:01| With the process that's going right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5341.0)|
| 1:29:03| it is something that we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5343.0)|
| 1:29:06| As Devin talked about and Mr. Lyon talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5346.0)|
| 1:29:10| some of this legacy language, who's in charge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5350.0)|
| 1:29:13| I agree with what Councilwoman Parker said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5353.0)|
| 1:29:17| Understanding these languages and how do we strengthen the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5357.0)|
| 1:29:20| and I believe that having not only ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5360.0)|
| 1:29:23| but also having administrative rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5363.0)|
| 1:29:26| also working through Civil Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5366.0)|
| 1:29:28| to have those Civil Service administrative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5368.0)|
| 1:29:30| their Civil Service Merit Board rules done as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5370.0)|
| 1:29:33| will help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5373.0)|
| 1:29:34| I think as we establish a clear line and lane of responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5374.0)|
| 1:29:40| I think you'll find it very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5380.0)|
| 1:29:42| So as we look at the next steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5382.0)|
| 1:29:44| I believe that City Council does need time to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5384.0)|
| 1:29:47| This information was brought to you all today as part of a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5387.0)|
| 1:29:52| I got this information the same time that you all did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5392.0)|
| 1:29:55| So I'm looking at this and I'm saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5395.0)|
| 1:29:58| Whoa, wow, we can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5398.0)|
| 1:30:00| How do we do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5400.0)|
| 1:30:01| But I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5401.0)|
| 1:30:02| I believe that we need to take time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5402.0)|
| 1:30:05| That's why as we look at this, how do we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5405.0)|
| 1:30:08| How do we upstate our administrative rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5408.0)|
| 1:30:10| How do we work with Civil Service Merit Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5410.0)|
| 1:30:13| to ensure that we're getting all of those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5413.0)|
| 1:30:15| and that we're all working together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5415.0)|
| 1:30:17| How do we ensure that we have training for supervisors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5417.0)|
| 1:30:20| our HR staff, and all of the city employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5420.0)|
| 1:30:24| Here's the timeline that I would like to bring forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5424.0)|
| 1:30:27| On September 13th is the next Civil Service Merit Board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5427.0)|
| 1:30:32| I have a standing time at the Civil Service Merit Board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5432.0)|
| 1:30:37| and we will use that time to ensure that we communicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5437.0)|
| 1:30:41| and educate all of the Civil Service Merit Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5441.0)|
| 1:30:44| They have access to this information now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5444.0)|
| 1:30:46| so they have about 13 days to look at this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5446.0)|
| 1:30:50| On September 19th, it will be the first reading of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5450.0)|
| 1:30:55| So as we look at this, it is not something that you had to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5455.0)|
| 1:30:58| and know all of this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5458.0)|
| 1:31:00| I am learning and I am building, as all of you are as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5460.0)|
| 1:31:04| So take the time to get this information to read through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5464.0)|
| 1:31:08| I know that this is a 69,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5468.0)|
| 1:31:10| I believe, page document, but as you look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5470.0)|
| 1:31:13| there's so much information here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5473.0)|
| 1:31:15| Take the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5475.0)|
| 1:31:17| It is not something that we have asked that you understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5477.0)|
| 1:31:20| and know today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5480.0)|
| 1:31:22| This is the first step in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5482.0)|
| 1:31:25| On September 27th is our quarterly supervisory training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5485.0)|
| 1:31:29| We will be having DEI training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5489.0)|
| 1:31:32| We will be having processes for supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5492.0)|
| 1:31:36| We have implemented this since the start of the HR department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5496.0)|
| 1:31:39| to have quarterly training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5499.0)|
| 1:31:41| It's something that we have been able to do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5501.0)|
| 1:31:44| October 3rd, we come back before you again with the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5504.0)|
| 1:31:48| Once and if you approve those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5508.0)|
| 1:31:51| then we will make adjustments to the administrative rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5511.0)|
| 1:31:55| As we look at that, we will then go back on October 11th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5515.0)|
| 1:31:59| to the Civil Service Merit Board once again to ask for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5519.0)|
| 1:32:03| if you approve this, how do we work together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5523.0)|
| 1:32:07| How do we ensure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5527.0)|
| 1:32:09| We want to make sure that all of this is congruent, as we said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5529.0)|
| 1:32:12| In October, we will also work with Title I through the ADA training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5532.0)|
| 1:32:18| I have been working specifically and directly with the ADA coordinator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5538.0)|
| 1:32:22| to ensure that training dollars are set up because there have not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5542.0)|
| 1:32:26| lots of training that's just been set up for ADA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5546.0)|
| 1:32:29| But under HR, we have been able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5549.0)|
| 1:32:32| The ADA coordinator was allowed and provided training to all supervisors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5552.0)|
| 1:32:37| at the last quarterly training and will continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5557.0)|
| 1:32:40| We will also have additional training for EEO processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5560.0)|
| 1:32:44| and as we go into November, we will continue to work with the ADA coordinator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5564.0)|
| 1:32:48| and staff on all of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5568.0)|
| 1:32:51| So as we look at this, I want to make sure that you understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5571.0)|
| 1:32:55| that the timeline is set up so we can take the time to get information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5575.0)|
| 1:33:00| to understand what is being done, and how do we work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5580.0)|
| 1:33:05| I agree this has been a process since 1945.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5585.0)|
| 1:33:10| I'm like, wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5590.0)|
| 1:33:12| And I started looking at this, and I want to assure you as we look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5592.0)|
| 1:33:18| HR has the capacity with the staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5598.0)|
| 1:33:21| It may mean some additional resources that was indicated here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5601.0)|
| 1:33:25| but we currently have the staffing to ensure that this is a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5605.0)|
| 1:33:30| that we can do this, and for the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5610.0)|
| 1:33:33| we can make it uniformed and we can have a place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5613.0)|
| 1:33:36| So thank you so very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5616.0)|
| 1:33:40| I'll return to Councilmember McKenna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5620.0)|
| 1:33:43| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5623.0)|
| 1:33:53| Wow, they keep raining on me with the birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5633.0)|
| 1:33:56| I've got a mint, and I get to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5636.0)|
| 1:34:01| So there was a question that I think is a concerning thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5641.0)|
| 1:34:08| I'd like some clarification on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5648.0)|
| 1:34:11| Do we have employee complaints that are 30 years outstanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5651.0)|
| 1:34:17| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5657.0)|
| 1:34:20| First off, happy birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5660.0)|
| 1:34:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5662.0)|
| 1:34:23| Let's make it about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5663.0)|
| 1:34:24| I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5664.0)|
| 1:34:25| Second, I can't say that this was not within the scope of this report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5665.0)|
| 1:34:30| but I can tell you that to my knowledge, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5670.0)|
| 1:34:34| So Councilwoman Parker had some questions about what complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5674.0)|
| 1:34:37| and what investigations there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5677.0)|
| 1:34:39| I don't know if Director Drummond, well, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5679.0)|
| 1:34:47| I mean, the comment was made, and I'd love for someone to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5687.0)|
| 1:34:51| Just to clarify, the resolution was brought forward because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5691.0)|
| 1:34:54| complaints from KPD officers, KPD officers who brought complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5694.0)|
| 1:34:59| directly to me because their complaints were not being heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5699.0)|
| 1:35:04| The purpose of the resolution was to investigate what is going on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5704.0)|
| 1:35:09| their complaints from what they were telling me were going up the chain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5709.0)|
| 1:35:14| of command and stopping at the law department and not being heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5714.0)|
| 1:35:20| not being dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5720.0)|
| 1:35:22| Once I brought that to the HR director, she investigated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5722.0)|
| 1:35:27| We had an officer who had complaints against him from the late 90s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5727.0)|
| 1:35:34| who decided to step down rather than to go through the investigations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5734.0)|
| 1:35:39| So those were the 30 years of complaints that nobody dealt with until I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5739.0)|
| 1:35:44| started screaming my head off and brought a resolution forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5744.0)|
| 1:35:48| So it's really unconcerning to hear we've been doing things great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5748.0)|
| 1:35:53| There haven't been bad intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5753.0)|
| 1:35:55| We just have a lot of confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5755.0)|
| 1:35:57| That's not been what the experience has been over the last four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5757.0)|
| 1:36:01| That's not what I'm hearing from city employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5761.0)|
| 1:36:03| And that's not resulting when we have officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5763.0)|
| 1:36:08| I don't know if there have been other staff members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5768.0)|
| 1:36:10| but officers who've left their position during an investigation of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5770.0)|
| 1:36:15| sexual harassment of their fellow employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5775.0)|
| 1:36:19| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5779.0)|
| 1:36:24| I'll leave it at that and I'll defer to Councilwoman McKenzie now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5784.0)|
| 1:36:29| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5789.0)|
| 1:36:31| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5791.0)|
| 1:36:33| So thank you for the extensive work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5793.0)|
| 1:36:38| The history was very informative and very concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5798.0)|
| 1:36:44| Just hearing over the years the steps that have been taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5804.0)|
| 1:36:50| and the steps that have been undone by different administrations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5810.0)|
| 1:36:55| and I think it's just a sign of the times that we were living in back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5815.0)|
| 1:37:00| But I also say that what we want to be very cautious of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5820.0)|
| 1:37:04| is making any hasty decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5824.0)|
| 1:37:06| And so, Director Drummond, I appreciate your timeline as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5826.0)|
| 1:37:10| training is concerned for your staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5830.0)|
| 1:37:13| regardless of what decisions are made by Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5833.0)|
| 1:37:17| I absolutely think that that should move forward and continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5837.0)|
| 1:37:20| I do think that the timeline that was presented feels a little bit aggressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5840.0)|
| 1:37:26| This is very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5846.0)|
| 1:37:28| and to see that not only myself wasn't able to be here for the entire workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5848.0)|
| 1:37:32| although I snuck and watched and listened to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5852.0)|
| 1:37:36| I think it would be worth having for our colleagues that were not able to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5856.0)|
| 1:37:40| another opportunity to hear this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5860.0)|
| 1:37:44| I have not had an opportunity to go through this report at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5864.0)|
| 1:37:48| I doubt that by the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5868.0)|
| 1:37:50| Maybe I will, maybe I won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5870.0)|
| 1:37:51| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5871.0)|
| 1:37:53| As it relates to complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5873.0)|
| 1:37:56| I don't know if there is information that's available to Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5876.0)|
| 1:38:01| that could just categorize complaints, what they were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5881.0)|
| 1:38:06| what they were related to, and outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5886.0)|
| 1:38:09| Even if that does not have names attached to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5889.0)|
| 1:38:11| I think that that would be helpful for us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5891.0)|
| 1:38:14| And then my other concern is what happens when the complaint is on HR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5894.0)|
| 1:38:21| when it's related to an HR employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5901.0)|
| 1:38:24| I know that we're talking about an EEO Deputy Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5904.0)|
| 1:38:29| but again, that person is working very closely with HR, working in tandem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5909.0)|
| 1:38:34| And so I have concerns about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5914.0)|
| 1:38:37| So I would like some additional information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5917.0)|
| 1:38:42| and an opportunity to do some reading this packet and some other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5922.0)|
| 1:38:48| before speaking any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5928.0)|
| 1:38:50| But as of right now, I'm not comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5930.0)|
| 1:38:52| I think it's very aggressive based on the fact that we're just getting this workshop today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5932.0)|
| 1:38:58| and this information today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5938.0)|
| 1:39:03| And I'm just going to leave it at that for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5943.0)|
| 1:39:05| Councilwoman McKenzie, I'll jump in only briefly to say that we also recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5945.0)|
| 1:39:09| that the lack of a cohesive index of complaints and resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5949.0)|
| 1:39:14| is one of the early gaps that was identified from the initial report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5954.0)|
| 1:39:18| that was prepared back in November of 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5958.0)|
| 1:39:21| and that led us to this deeper analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5961.0)|
| 1:39:23| Because, again, what we saw from that initial scan was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5963.0)|
| 1:39:26| because there was confusion in our code and inalignment of responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5966.0)|
| 1:39:31| those expectations for that type of reporting were not necessarily clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5971.0)|
| 1:39:35| and that there was not a clear, again, chain of command,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5975.0)|
| 1:39:39| as previous speakers have mentioned, to say who does what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5979.0)|
| 1:39:43| and what is the expectation, who is tracking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5983.0)|
| 1:39:46| and are they only tracking concerns that entered their door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5986.0)|
| 1:39:49| or are they also who is responsible for tracking concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5989.0)|
| 1:39:52| that may have entered through other doors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5992.0)|
| 1:39:54| So, again, this analysis has helped us identify a path to consolidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5994.0)|
| 1:39:58| and ensure that there's clear expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5998.0)|
| 1:40:01| and therefore a clear point to track and measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6001.0)|
| 1:40:04| and inform for that type of index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6004.0)|
| 1:40:06| So I appreciate your perspective because it is an important thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6006.0)|
| 1:40:09| that we would argue, and I think outlined in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6009.0)|
| 1:40:13| it didn't necessarily exist in the same cohesive citywide perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6013.0)|
| 1:40:17| that perhaps it ought to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6017.0)|
| 1:40:19| So thank you for that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6019.0)|
| 1:40:21| And I appreciate your comments as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6021.0)|
| 1:40:23| And what I will say is, for a point of clarity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6023.0)|
| 1:40:26| just as HR could be the appointed department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6026.0)|
| 1:40:30| there could also be an additional department that could be created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6030.0)|
| 1:40:34| that could be the stand-alone where everyone knows that that's where it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6034.0)|
| 1:40:37| And so, again, we're just getting this information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6037.0)|
| 1:40:40| so I'm going to reserve a lot more further comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6040.0)|
| 1:40:45| But, again, I do have some concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6045.0)|
| 1:40:49| and hopefully looking through this information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6049.0)|
| 1:40:51| and some additional research may change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6051.0)|
| 1:40:54| But as of right now, I do think that we're being very hasty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6054.0)|
| 1:40:58| and the timeline feels that it's rushed right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6058.0)|
| 1:41:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6061.0)|
| 1:41:03| And if I may briefly, Councilman McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6063.0)|
| 1:41:06| just to your last point about what if there is a complaint against someone in HR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6066.0)|
| 1:41:11| Policies that have been identified by other local governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6071.0)|
| 1:41:14| and that we currently have in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6074.0)|
| 1:41:16| would allow a filing of a complaint with, as it currently reads here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6076.0)|
| 1:41:21| the civil service director or the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6081.0)|
| 1:41:24| Going forward, adopting these recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6084.0)|
| 1:41:27| would mean that if in the limited circumstance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6087.0)|
| 1:41:30| there would be a complaint against an HR member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6090.0)|
| 1:41:33| the law department is always an option to fill those complaints, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6093.0)|
| 1:41:37| And number two, these city policies do not operate in a vacuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6097.0)|
| 1:41:42| The city is still under the obligation to comply with state and federal law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6102.0)|
| 1:41:45| which provides many other outlets for employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6105.0)|
| 1:41:48| to pursue any allegations or complaints that they may have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6108.0)|
| 1:41:51| irrespective of city policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6111.0)|
| 1:41:55| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6115.0)|
| 1:41:57| But I also know that there's also fear of retaliation and intimidation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6117.0)|
| 1:42:04| and not necessarily outward, but subtly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6124.0)|
| 1:42:07| And so I do know that there, over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6127.0)|
| 1:42:10| that there are people who have worked for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6130.0)|
| 1:42:13| and who now don't work for the city anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6133.0)|
| 1:42:15| either because they've retired or other reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6135.0)|
| 1:42:18| that have left the city and not felt that they were comfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6138.0)|
| 1:42:21| that they could trust that if they went to file a formal complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6141.0)|
| 1:42:26| that it would be addressed and they would be treated fairly and equitably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6146.0)|
| 1:42:30| And so let's not dismiss that that's not out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6150.0)|
| 1:42:33| you know, to some degree with some employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6153.0)|
| 1:42:36| And when we talked about the history, and I know my time is up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6156.0)|
| 1:42:38| but when we talked about the history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6158.0)|
| 1:42:40| I heard nothing mentioned about racial discrimination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6160.0)|
| 1:42:42| and those were during some very turbulent times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6162.0)|
| 1:42:45| when that was very prevalent and that was never mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6165.0)|
| 1:42:49| And I don't know if that was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6169.0)|
| 1:42:51| and people probably were afraid back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6171.0)|
| 1:42:53| You know, when I hear that, yes, there was a person that was appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6173.0)|
| 1:42:56| by a mayor to sit as a clerk for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6176.0)|
| 1:42:59| and then it gets voted, that person, that department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6179.0)|
| 1:43:02| that position gets voted out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6182.0)|
| 1:43:04| And so I just don't want us to be remiss to think that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6184.0)|
| 1:43:07| everything is fine just because we're doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6187.0)|
| 1:43:10| and because we're talking about it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6190.0)|
| 1:43:12| Those feelings still persist with some people within our, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6192.0)|
| 1:43:18| the city government who work for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6198.0)|
| 1:43:21| And so, again, this is why I think that I don't want us to be hasty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6201.0)|
| 1:43:25| in anything that we do, but, again, I'm one voice, one opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6205.0)|
| 1:43:29| But I do think it's imperative and important that our colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6209.0)|
| 1:43:32| who have not had the opportunity to hear this presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6212.0)|
| 1:43:35| get this information, even those of us that are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6215.0)|
| 1:43:38| haven't had an opportunity to read through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6218.0)|
| 1:43:41| get another opportunity to sit before you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6221.0)|
| 1:43:44| and ask additional questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6224.0)|
| 1:43:47| and maybe may have some additional recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6227.0)|
| 1:43:50| or some things that could be modified as we move forward in this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6230.0)|
| 1:43:54| because, again, we have to get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6234.0)|
| 1:43:57| I mean, this has been going on back and forth for many, many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6237.0)|
| 1:44:00| and so I do applaud the fact that now it's being addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6240.0)|
| 1:44:04| because it's been, I mean, Mr. Zimbabwe has stood before councils| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6244.0)|
| 1:44:08| probably for the last 50 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6248.0)|
| 1:44:10| and this is what he's talked about and he's asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6250.0)|
| 1:44:13| And so now it's being done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6253.0)|
| 1:44:15| and I know that it's primarily prompted by Councilmember Parker's resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6255.0)|
| 1:44:20| but it's always been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6260.0)|
| 1:44:22| It's always been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6262.0)|
| 1:44:24| So I'm grateful that it's being addressed now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6264.0)|
| 1:44:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6267.0)|
| 1:44:29| And I share the concerns that my colleagues have expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6269.0)|
| 1:44:32| about the aggressive timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6272.0)|
| 1:44:36| I do think this was an important first step for us today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6276.0)|
| 1:44:41| in looking at this report and getting this, like I said, very thorough report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6281.0)|
| 1:44:46| I'm glad that ultimately we had about seven of our nine members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6286.0)|
| 1:44:51| who were able to attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6291.0)|
| 1:44:53| but people's schedules change and that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6293.0)|
| 1:44:56| So I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6296.0)|
| 1:44:58| I think this is a very critical and important decision to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6298.0)|
| 1:45:03| about how we move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6303.0)|
| 1:45:05| so I do think we should return to this subject after some time to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6305.0)|
| 1:45:10| So I agree with my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6310.0)|
| 1:45:12| I think what I was hearing a lot shared is what we want to make sure we end up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6312.0)|
| 1:45:19| is a place where all employees know where they can go and it's not confusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6319.0)|
| 1:45:26| and a transparent process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6326.0)|
| 1:45:28| And what I was hearing from Dr. Drummond and through the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6328.0)|
| 1:45:34| I think the ultimate plan you're going to bring us will be doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6334.0)|
| 1:45:38| but I think we need to look into that further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6338.0)|
| 1:45:41| I think council needs some time to digest this and then look at that further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6341.0)|
| 1:45:45| because I think we all have the same goal of what we're looking for here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6345.0)|
| 1:45:51| The only other concern that I wanted to bring up was just from the review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6351.0)|
| 1:45:58| it sounded to me like the charter really reserves a lot of this EEO function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6358.0)|
| 1:46:04| in the executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6364.0)|
| 1:46:06| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6366.0)|
| 1:46:07| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6367.0)|
| 1:46:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6368.0)|
| 1:46:09| So in the charter itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6369.0)|
| 1:46:11| are there any checks that exist on that authority that are mentioned in the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6371.0)|
| 1:46:19| or is that something that has to come in through administrative rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6379.0)|
| 1:46:24| or some other ordinances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6384.0)|
| 1:46:26| There are limited checks through annual reports that I mentioned to kick us off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6386.0)|
| 1:46:31| to city council, for example, from a Title VI standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6391.0)|
| 1:46:34| That's one key check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6394.0)|
| 1:46:36| There are checks on certain facets of discrimination complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6396.0)|
| 1:46:41| that you see through the merit board through allegations of discrimination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6401.0)|
| 1:46:44| in hiring, transfer, or promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6404.0)|
| 1:46:46| There is a check in that the merit board can assist with the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6406.0)|
| 1:46:51| of an EEO plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6411.0)|
| 1:46:53| So the merit board will have a say in the overall plan and how it's developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6413.0)|
| 1:46:58| But in terms of the actual enforcement of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6418.0)|
| 1:47:01| there are very few checks that are provided by charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6421.0)|
| 1:47:05| And for that reason, as you'll see in reading the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6425.0)|
| 1:47:09| they're within the legal opinions that have been promulgated for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6429.0)|
| 1:47:14| While the charter may be silent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6434.0)|
| 1:47:16| attorneys will typically point to city council and seek guidance from city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6436.0)|
| 1:47:20| which is why it's important that we get this ordinance right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6440.0)|
| 1:47:23| and actually provide some guidance and enforcement authority in the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6443.0)|
| 1:47:28| from city council that is charter compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6448.0)|
| 1:47:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6451.0)|
| 1:47:32| And during your report, I think I heard you say that maybe some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6452.0)|
| 1:47:39| but not all protected classes were mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6459.0)|
| 1:47:42| Was that part of what you had said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6462.0)|
| 1:47:44| And so maybe one of these changes was to make sure that's updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6464.0)|
| 1:47:47| so that all protected classes are discussed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6467.0)|
| 1:47:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6470.0)|
| 1:47:51| All protected classes are discussed and codified in Section 15-57 of the code currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6471.0)|
| 1:47:57| But whenever protected classes are cited in other city policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6477.0)|
| 1:48:02| or in civil service merit board rules, not all of them are listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6482.0)|
| 1:48:05| And that's just a product of time where certain policies have been revised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6485.0)|
| 1:48:09| more frequently than others, and the ones that have not been revised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6489.0)|
| 1:48:12| have not been updated to include every protected class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6492.0)|
| 1:48:14| So I would suggest that the easiest way to solve that problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6494.0)|
| 1:48:19| is to keep Section 15-57 the way it is with all current protected classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6499.0)|
| 1:48:24| and then every other policy of the city cite to that code provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6504.0)|
| 1:48:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6509.0)|
| 1:48:30| Well, I mean, obviously we want to make sure that update occurs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6510.0)|
| 1:48:33| because that's also very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6513.0)|
| 1:48:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6516.0)|
| 1:48:37| I don't see any further lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6517.0)|
| 1:48:38| I want to thank you all for your presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6518.0)|
| 1:48:40| and we'll continue to work on this and revisit it, and I'll close this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6520.0)|
| 1:48:45| Thank you all so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6525.0)|
