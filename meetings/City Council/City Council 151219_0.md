| 0:00:50| one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=50)|
| 0:00:57| Please call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=57)|
| 0:00:59| Councilman Brown. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=59)|
| 0:01:01| Councilman Campin. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=61)|
| 0:01:03| Councilman Dellivoki. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=63)|
| 0:01:05| Councilman Grieve. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=65)|
| 0:01:07| Councilwoman Palmer. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=67)|
| 0:01:09| Vice Mayor Pavlis. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=69)|
| 0:01:10| Councilman Saunders. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=70)|
| 0:01:12| Councilman Starr. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=72)|
| 0:01:14| Councilman Wallace. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=74)|
| 0:01:16| We're all present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=76)|
| 0:01:21| At this time I'll call on the Council for City Council, Rob Frost, to explain our procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=81)|
| 0:01:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=87)|
| 0:01:29| Very briefly, this is a proposed procedure that we emailed to you all a day or two ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=89)|
| 0:01:36| It actually was prepared by Mr. Swanson a number of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=96)|
| 0:01:40| and when I was a member of City Council, this procedure worked very nicely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=100)|
| 0:01:45| It takes away any concern that someone has that they're interested in a position and they need someone to nominate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=105)|
| 0:01:53| But this way, that's not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=113)|
| 0:01:57| You're able to simply say whether or not you wish to be under consideration for a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=117)|
| 0:02:05| I'll briefly read this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=125)|
| 0:02:07| The Presiding Officer states the office which is to be filled and then conducts a roll call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| asking each individual whether he or she wishes to be considered for that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=132)|
| 0:02:17| Next, each member of Council is called upon by the Presiding Officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=137)|
| 0:02:21| and responds with the last name of the member for whom they wish to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=141)|
| 0:02:26| If no candidate has obtained the necessary five votes after all the votes are announced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=146)|
| 0:02:30| persons receiving no votes, if any, are deleted and the vote is taken again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=150)|
| 0:02:35| If no candidate has the required number of votes upon completion of the second round,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| the person or persons receiving the lowest number of votes are eliminated with each successive round of voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=160)|
| 0:02:46| until a candidate receives the required majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| Now, the optional part is whether or not Council decides if they would like to have any speeches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=171)|
| 0:02:57| on why a person should or should not be supported for that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=177)|
| 0:03:04| That's the decision of this body, whether or not they wish to do this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=184)|
| 0:03:10| Considering that there are no newcomers here, everyone knows everyone well at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=190)|
| 0:03:16| that may not be necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=196)|
| 0:03:19| But if there is a desire to have speeches in favor of someone's candidacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=199)|
| 0:03:25| I think it would be an idea that would require the vote of the majority of the members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| Any questions for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| I guess just to be clear, just to have any deliberation, we have to have a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| If, say, for sake of argument, I wanted to nominate Mr. Johnson for some office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=220)|
| 0:03:49| I guess the question is do people want to have the opportunity to speak in favor of his candidacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=229)|
| 0:03:56| or in favor of someone's other candidacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| That's what I was referencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=238)|
| 0:04:05| Okay, so we will start with the election of the Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=245)|
| 0:04:09| So I think if I'm doing this right, Mr. Frost, then I will start and just call on each person around the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=249)|
| 0:04:15| And let us know if you would like to be considered for Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| Okay, so we have two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=278)|
| 0:04:45| Councilman Grieve and Vice Mayor Pavlis wish to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| So now we'll go around again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| We need to decide whether they want to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| Okay, so is there a motion to allow deliberation or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=294)|
| 0:05:00| I mean, does anybody wish to deliberate on this publicly or do you know who you want to vote for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=300)|
| 0:05:05| I'll make the motion we deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| Okay, let's have a vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| There's a motion and a second that we have some discussion about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| Okay, so Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| Well, I want to say that we have enjoyed a very cohesive time on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=320)|
| 0:05:29| and I think that's one of our strengths, that we can agree and disagree and yet carry a great amount of respect for everyone across here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=329)|
| 0:05:38| As I've said often, I've voted with everybody up here and I've voted against everybody up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| and they've indulged me with the same, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| But I want to say that, Nick, you've done an outstanding job leading us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| You've been a friend to me on council, and I hope we will enjoy that over the next two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| You've led us well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| But I want to support Duane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| Duane, not necessarily because Duane, I always vote with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| It's not about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| Duane has showed me the importance of building consensus really in the neighborhood and in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=369)|
| 0:06:17| He's shown me the importance of having collaboration with the people that don't always agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=377)|
| 0:06:24| He's been a leader, and also been a friend in leading, and I want to support him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=384)|
| 0:06:30| I have all the respect for you, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| You've done an outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| But I want to support Duane in this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| Any other council members wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| Vice Mayor Pavlis, you have led us through some tumultuous times over the past few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=404)|
| 0:06:50| We dealt with the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| We dealt with some other issues that came before council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| Councilman Grave, you led us through the sign ordeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| I think that's probably a better name for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| And that seemed to go on for a good part of our lives on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| I was about to think that we would all be finished with our terms, but it didn't work out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| But we also have had –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| Let's make sure we speak in –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=433)|
| 0:07:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| Everybody can hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| Also, we have had tremendous change in the city council office with three new members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| And Vice Mayor Pavlis helped us through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| He's very aware of what that office needs to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| And for that reason and some others, I will be supporting Vice Mayor Pavlis for another term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=451)|
| 0:07:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| It's an especially uniquely difficult situation when you have two wedding guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=461)|
| 0:07:48| Have you already gotten gifts from both of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| Anyway, so it's a very tough decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| I sort of echo what Councilman Wallace thinks, done a very good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=474)|
| 0:07:59| But I think the nature with term limits and the nature of this body, I think it's good for other people to experience leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=479)|
| 0:08:09| And so I'll be supporting Councilmember Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| It's a difficult decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| I have no doubt in the abilities of either one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| Both of them are very capable and very able.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| I think that Vice Mayor Pavlis has done an excellent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| And I'm of the opinion of not changing horses in the middle of the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| So I'm going to be supporting Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| But I have great respect and admiration for Councilman Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| But I'm going to support Pavlis today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| So I'll go around the room and call on each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| We'll start on this side first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151219?start=539)|
