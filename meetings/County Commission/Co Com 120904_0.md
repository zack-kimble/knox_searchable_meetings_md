| 0:00:55| Do I hear a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=55)|
| 0:00:59| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=59)|
| 0:01:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=60)|
| 0:01:02| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=62)|
| 0:01:04| Mr. Chair, could I ask the law director to just explain the nuances of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=64)|
| 0:01:09| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=69)|
| 0:01:10| Are there any changes in the procedures that we've had before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=70)|
| 0:01:13| Commissioner Hammond, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=73)|
| 0:01:14| The charter requires this to be done really on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=74)|
| 0:01:20| We had looked back in the law office and found out that it hadn't been done since the 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=80)|
| 0:01:24| This is the same procedure that they used during your election and prior elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=84)|
| 0:01:28| but it's supposed to be done according to Section 206 of the charter and 203E of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=88)|
| 0:01:37| And this is just a formality to make it a little stronger to defend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=97)|
| 0:01:43| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=103)|
| 0:01:44| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=104)|
| 0:01:45| If not, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=105)|

| 0:03:36| Prior to my vote, I'd like to say I do a whole lot of difficult votes first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| so for this one to start in the Ninth when one hadn't started in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=220)|
| 0:03:48| That's all I'll say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=228)|

| 0:04:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| Commissioner Norman and Commissioner Anders have been nominated for chairman of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| Is there a motion to close the nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=248)|

| 0:04:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=255)|
| 0:04:17| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=257)|

| 0:04:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| So we'll take a roll call vote now, starting with Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=267)|
| 0:04:36| Sorry, in the Ninth District, my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| But wouldn't you start in the Eleventh District instead of in the Ninth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| If you're going to do a roll call vote from in reverse order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| wouldn't you let that begin with the Eleventh District and not the Ninth District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| I think that makes more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| The Eleventh District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=292)|

| 0:06:27| Commissioner, would you like to come and take over the rest of the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=387)|
| 0:06:52| First of all, I'd like to say thank you to the Commissioner and my colleagues, all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| As I've said several times on interviews, regardless of who's chosen chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=416)|
| 0:07:03| I think this county is in tremendously better shape than it was in 2006 when many of us were here for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=423)|
| 0:07:13| And we've experienced so many trials and tribulations in these years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=433)|
| 0:07:23| And so I appreciate your support and your confidence in me to be chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=443)|
| 0:07:32| You all know me very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| I'm very impassioned about certain issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| I will retreat from those passions and try to serve this board fairly and equitably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=456)|
| 0:07:45| and not be too --" I'll tone down my vitriol somewhat in some of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=465)|
| 0:07:54| So I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| The next item is the selection of vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| So do we hear nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| Let's just do it from the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| Do we need to call roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| I think that's in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| Is that procedural?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| Let's start with Mr. McKenzie in the first, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=503)|

| 0:10:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| The next part of this is the committee selection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| And, okay, so the committee on committees is appointed by the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=665)|
| 0:11:13| I would like to appoint the following to the committee on committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| McKenzie, Broyles, Briggs, Wright, and Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=677)|
| 0:11:24| The committee on committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| And the rules to the rules committee, I'd like to appoint McKenzie, Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=687)|
| 0:11:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| Rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| McKenzie, Broyles, Hammond, Brown, and Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=700)|
| 0:11:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| Now, we convene those committees to form those subcommittees, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=709)|
| 0:11:58| Ag Extension, County Services, Arena Use, Cable TV, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=718)|
| 0:12:05| And so we're going to stop this meeting for a few minutes, and then we'll reconvene for approval of those other committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=725)|
| 0:12:16| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| Ms. Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| As a member of the committee on committees, if anyone is interested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| particularly in one of these, please speak up and say so, because I would prefer that we appoint people who are very interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=747)|
| 0:12:34| in doing whatever particular committee it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| So if any of you have a preference, let me know, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| Or someone else who's on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| I'd like to be on the Ag Extension Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| Amy, I'd like to be on the Arena Use Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| I'll go over there every now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=770)|
| 0:12:56| Would it be helpful for me to read those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| You all are on it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| So you're on Ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| Larry's on Arena Use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| Let me just read those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| Does everybody have a copy, Jolie, of the blank?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| Let me go ahead and read the current committee composition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=794)|
| 0:13:20| So Ag Extension is three, and it's Broyles, Briggs, and Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| These are the current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| Then Arena Use is McKenzie, Smith, and Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=808)|
| 0:13:35| Cable TV, there's nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| So it's McKenzie, Broyles, Norman, Briggs, Anders, Smith, Wright, Brown, Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=817)|
| 0:13:46| Cable TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| Community Television is Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| I think that was a designee of McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=834)|
| 0:14:01| Court Subcommittee was Broyles, Norman, Anders, Smith, Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| Development Corp was, and these are, these now will be the chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=847)|
| 0:14:14| the new chair, and the vice chair plus Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| Is that right, Jolie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| Yeah, we would need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| We would need to reappoint Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| Insolvency Board, McKenzie, Norman, Smith, and Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=866)|
| 0:14:35| Investment Committee is the chair and Ed Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| I'd like to stay on there if possible, but I won't contest it when I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| You're going to have to stay on there, whether you want to or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=884)|
| 0:14:51| County Services is the chair, McKenzie, Broyles, and Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=891)|
| 0:14:58| TPO is the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| And then Pension Board stays the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| So it's Hammond, Norman, Briggs, and Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| Ms. Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| Can I just make a motion, then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| that we reappoint all of those people to the same committees that they've been serving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| I think that's appropriate, unless we have somebody that wants to change out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=917)|
| 0:15:23| And I also would like to point out, I've been on most of these committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| and we've never had a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| And there's one thing that I would like to do and bring to the Rules Committee before the next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=929)|
| 0:15:37| before our next commission meeting, the September meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| I would like to bring another committee possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| and have Rules Committee discuss one or two new committees that are kind of umbrella committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=944)|
| 0:15:51| that may combine some of these or function to diminish the rancor a little bit, I hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=951)|
| 0:16:02| in a couple of areas for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| So we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| Wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| Mr. Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| I'd like to be added to the Cable TV Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| Since I'm no longer with Comcast, I can serve on that committee now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| I think my expertise would come in handy there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| And I'd like to be removed from the Cable Television Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| I'll have you take my place on Cable TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| And remove from the TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| Yeah, from community television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| Do we have someone who would volunteer to serve on community television?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1004)|
| 0:16:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1011)|
| 0:16:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| Other changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| Well, I don't know if this is proper or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| but maybe I'll ask for a friendly amendment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1024)|
| 0:17:09| But, you know, just as I've listened over the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| I think that it's not disparaging toward anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| But I'd like to maybe take a look at keeping Commissioner Andrews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| on the Development Corporation Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| I think he was really engaged in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| So if Commissioner Briggs would consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| If not, I'll maybe do something differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| Commissioner Briggs, you respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| I'll go ahead and respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| I think that I'm going to be involved in economic development either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| And so I think Commissioner Briggs adds more to the board than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| But I do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| Other changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| Joe, they just put a sticky on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| It says community TV has to be the chair of cable TV or their designee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1083)|
| 0:18:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| So I guess at this point I am the chairman of the cable television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1094)|
| 0:18:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| So will you serve in that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| Unless Commissioner Broyles would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| I just raised my hand because nobody else did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| I don't mind to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| Let's just keep it with you, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| Is that okay with you, Ms. Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| Is that all the changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| Are there other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| I'd like for the law director, if you would, to look at this cable TV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| committee because with the changes in state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| it has significantly diminished what the cable TV can and can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| So if you could research that for us and let us know exactly what our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| authority is and is not with regards to cable TV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| because we get quite a few phone calls from people who say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| but yet under the new state law, there's not a lot we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| and we really have to refer people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| But if you could kind of give us the nuances of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| that would be helpful, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| Do you need a second to the motion to accept?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1164)|

| 0:19:35| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1175)|
| 0:19:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1192)|
| 0:20:04| Now we need a motion to accept the spread of record property assessor bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1204)|
| 0:20:11| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1213)|

| 0:20:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| Do we have any other business before the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| I hear a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom120904?start=1229)|
