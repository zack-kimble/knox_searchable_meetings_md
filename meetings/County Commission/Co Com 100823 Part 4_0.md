| 0:00:00| that we need to look at all avenues and see if we can find a way to build a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=0)|
| 0:00:05| I know there are jurisdictional concerns, but there's got to be a way to work out these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5)|
| 0:00:09| things for the good of the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=9)|
| 0:00:11| After all, the bottom line is the kids and teachers in the audience here tonight are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=11)|
| 0:00:15| the ones suffering while the adults are arguing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=15)|
| 0:00:18| I spoke to the school board last Wednesday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=18)|
| 0:00:21| It felt like I was back in the old USSR speaking to the Politburo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=21)|
| 0:00:25| Here's what the community heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=25)|
| 0:00:27| We know what's best for your kids and your community, and you're going to love it when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=27)|
| 0:00:30| we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=30)|
| 0:00:31| Listen to the community tonight, and listen to what the community is going to say to their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=31)|
| 0:00:36| representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=36)|
| 0:00:37| Our kids and the staff deserve the same as every other child in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=37)|
| 0:00:40| We don't deserve a more than adequate facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=40)|
| 0:00:42| We deserve a new Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=42)|
| 0:00:45| So tonight I ask you on behalf of the faculty, staff, parents, community, students, and future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=45)|
| 0:00:49| students of Carter Elementary School to defer action on the resolution presented by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=49)|
| 0:00:54| superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=54)|
| 0:00:56| Let's find a way to work together as Knox County citizens to do the right thing in replacing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=56)|
| 0:01:00| a school building that is more than to serve its purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=60)|
| 0:01:03| After all, if we build it, the awards we're winning will keep coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=63)|
| 0:01:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=67)|
| 0:01:08| Mike McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=68)|
| 0:01:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, honorable commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=84)|
| 0:01:38| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=98)|
| 0:01:39| Mike McMillan, 8406 Thorngrove Pike, Knoxville 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=99)|
| 0:01:50| I know it's been a long day for you, and I will be as brief as I possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=110)|
| 0:01:55| I just wanted to mention that the environmental concerns at Carter, I believe, I know other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=115)|
| 0:02:04| schools have environmental concerns, but I don't know of any school that has the environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=124)|
| 0:02:10| concerns that Carter, that exist at Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=130)|
| 0:02:14| And I do believe it's going to be very, very difficult through renovations to get rid of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=134)|
| 0:02:22| all of those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| Now, there, I believe Mr. Armstrong mentioned that there had been a request for a risk management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=143)|
| 0:02:33| assessment study, and I think that includes something like 12 or 13 items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=153)|
| 0:02:43| I would, and several people have mentioned it, the fact that we have a new mayor, a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=163)|
| 0:02:49| board of education, and a new board of commissioners coming on board after September the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=169)|
| 0:02:59| I would like for you to ask that you postpone this matter or delay it until that could be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=179)|
| 0:03:12| that assessment study could be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| I think it probably is something that could be done within 30 days, 30 or 45 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=196)|
| 0:03:26| If you would do that, I believe that we would all come out winners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=206)|
| 0:03:32| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=212)|
| 0:03:40| Matt Giles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=220)|
| 0:03:49| Matt Giles of 9011 Richfield Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| I'm a pastor of Lions Creek Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| We're a couple hundred yards from the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| And I've been in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| I've been a member of the community for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| And I got there and bought a brand-new house in one of the four brand-new subdivisions in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=245)|
| 0:04:13| and drove around with a member of our church who showed me the land where the new Carter Elementary School would go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=253)|
| 0:04:21| And yesterday we had 353 people in our worship service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| And two years ago when I got here, every single one of them thought they were getting a new elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| because it had been promised to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| And they have land to show for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| And every one of those people would also do anything and everything to help the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=278)|
| 0:04:44| It is the thing in the Carter community that holds it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| It doesn't matter denomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| It doesn't matter community organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| They will all come running to help the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| And you can see that in any of the church organizations or leaders that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=293)|
| 0:04:57| There's no doubt about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| They will do something to help the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| We want the best for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| You can see it in the teachers' administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| They work hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| See, I have the privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| My wife has a master's degree in education from the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| And she was a teacher until we had kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| I had the privilege of taking my daughter to her first day of kindergarten last week at Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=314)|
| 0:05:21| And something that was frustrating for me was that not in a complaining way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=321)|
| 0:05:27| and it was before this thing became a hot issue, somebody said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| oh, is your daughter going to Carter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| I said, yes, she's going to Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| And they said, well, just make sure she doesn't drink out of the water fountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=335)|
| 0:05:39| That's just wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| Now, you guys don't make decisions about the school situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| And we're not asking you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| There's something I love about East Tennessee, and I'm proud that I grew up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| East Tennessee is full of people, for the most part, that want to do right by each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| You know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| We're people that want to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| And so what we're asking you to do is to defer this back to the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| so that we can talk to them and make sure the right thing happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| See, the people have spoken, and we'll make it right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| because we've already voted and already done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| We're just asking you to defer this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| and let us work with them and make sure that we get the school we deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| Carter Elementary needs a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| It deserves a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| It expected a new school, and a new school is the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| So I want to ask you to defer this because it's the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=394)|

| 0:07:00| Jana Preston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| Good evening. My name is Reverend Jana Preston. I live at 9131 Trentville Way. I have two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=423)|
| 0:07:14| daughters who attended Carter Elementary. One is now a senior in college and she is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| getting her degree in early childhood education. The other is a senior at Carter High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| I was a substitute teacher and a personal accountability class teacher from 1998 until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| 2000. My mother began at the same school building in 1938. As you can imagine, we have a deep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=451)|
| 0:07:41| affection for the building and for the Carter community. However, because of that deep affection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=461)|
| 0:07:48| for the community, I'm compelled to urge you to try and help us get a new Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=468)|
| 0:07:58| It's my understanding that the school board approved a new school twice and we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=478)|
| 0:08:04| asked to step aside for other school projects. Our time is now. Renovations are not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=484)|
| 0:08:14| This is for several reasons, many of which we've hashed out. But I would like to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=494)|
| 0:08:20| what guarantees we are going to have once these renovations are completed that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=500)|
| 0:08:27| asbestos and the lead paint is not going to go into the air and going into the other parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=507)|
| 0:08:34| of the building. I'd like to know what guarantees will be put in place that it will be safely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=514)|
| 0:08:40| removed, completely removed. What kind of testing will be done following the renovations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=520)|
| 0:08:48| That same kind of concern applies to the mold. More importantly, however, and what I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=528)|
| 0:08:55| emphasize tonight, and I've not heard anybody mention it, is if we simply do renovations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=535)|
| 0:09:03| at Carter, we are going to be putting an extravagant Band-Aid on something. As a minister, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=543)|
| 0:09:13| scripture that comes to mind is that you don't put new patches on old cloth. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=553)|
| 0:09:23| had so many amazing people come from the Carter community, to come from Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=563)|
| 0:09:33| We've had Rick Grubbs, who is part of the school system, Director of Transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| Laura Boring, Supervisor of K-8 Physical Education for Knox County Schools, Suzanne| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=579)|
| 0:09:47| Sanders, Kindergarten at Knox County, Susan Davis, Principal at Cedar Bluff Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=587)|
| 0:09:54| Dena Merritt-Taylor, Teacher at Gibbs Elementary, Richard Beeler, Attorney and former Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=594)|
| 0:10:00| County Law Director, Daniel Sanders, Attorney with Knox County Law Director. Our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=600)|
| 0:10:07| are an investment. A new school would be an investment. We are not a liability. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=607)|
| 0:10:16| are an investment. We are asking that you invest in our children by building a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=616)|
| 0:10:27| How in the world can an 84-year-old building have the wiring, have all of the things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=627)|
| 0:10:34| a school that we are wanting to have excellent things come from, excellent for all? How are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=634)|
| 0:10:42| we going to do that with a building that's 84 years old? I just don't see how that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=642)|
| 0:10:48| happen. Think of the possibilities. If we've had those kind of people come out of Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=648)|
| 0:10:57| for years, think of the possibilities that can happen if they have a school with all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| of the things that meet new technology now. Think of what we can do in Knox County once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=663)|
| 0:11:12| those children are older. Please help us get a new school. Thank you very much for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=672)|
| 0:11:20| time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| Our last person is Nick Dellavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=681)|
| 0:11:39| Good evening. My name is Nick Dellavopi. I live at 5216 Crestwood Drive. And I'm here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=699)|
| 0:11:44| as a resident of East Knox County. And actually I didn't come planning to speak, but I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| want to talk to you tonight because I really do believe that this policymaking body, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=710)|
| 0:11:57| fund appropriating body has an important mission and has to have an important vision of where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=717)|
| 0:12:03| we're going with our school system. And I think there's a perception out there, maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| it's even partly wrong, but I think there's a perception out in the community that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| you want your kids to get a good education, you take them to West Knoxville, you take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| them to Merrillville. And we regularly experience in my community people that come and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| homestead a house and fix it up and get it nice and become a part of the community and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=745)|
| 0:12:32| then find themselves with their kids getting to be 7 or 8 or 9 years old and they uproot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=752)|
| 0:12:38| themselves and they move to another school district. And I think it's important that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=758)|
| 0:12:44| you as leaders of the community and of this county commission think about what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| doing. We're artificially skewing the population west, constantly west. One of the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=769)|
| 0:12:55| they talk about doing the southwest elementary school first instead of one at Carter is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=775)|
| 0:13:02| population is growing there faster. Well, it happens for a reason. And there's a sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| of a self-fulfilling prophecy that goes on. I remember when they built the Lotz Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| School on Westland Drive to meet a growing population there, before they got the bricks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=793)|
| 0:13:19| and mortar done, there were five new subdivisions that were built and the school had a full,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=799)|
| 0:13:25| almost overcrowded condition. And it tells you something. It tells you that parents know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=805)|
| 0:13:32| that aside from putting a roof over their kid's head and food in their belly and giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| them some kind of a moral bearing that will carry them through life, the most important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| thing they can do is give them an education. And I submit to you, you need to have good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| schools in every part of this county. And I think that when you do that, you'll find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| yourself not widening roads in West Knoxville and spending millions of dollars doing things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=830)|
| 0:13:55| to fix the infrastructure, because we are artificially skewing the growth to where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=835)|
| 0:14:01| schools are that are considered better by the people who live here. And I think we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| to start facing that fact and trying to balance where we put our education dollars and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=846)|
| 0:14:14| keep the population where they want to live. I look around and see these people. They love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| their Carter community. They want to live there. They don't want to see their neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| leave. They want to have a good school for their kids to go. So please, I think the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| on the floor that you're considering to defer for 30 days is a good one. And I hope that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| both bodies, both the school board and this commission, will do what they can to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=870)|
| 0:14:36| at schools as an investment in the future of this greater community. Thank you very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=881)|
| 0:14:51| Seeing no other likes, we have a substitute motion on the floor to revert back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| school board. Is everyone clear on the motion? Ready for the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=896)|
| 0:15:04| The motion is to defer 30 days, is it not? No, the substitute motion is to revert back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| to the school board. Okay. Which I guess means that they would vote on it and then bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=907)|
| 0:15:15| something back to this commission? Is that what the intent is? At their pleasure. At| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| their pleasure. Which I guess, okay, whatever. I'll bring something back. All in favor say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=920)|
| 0:15:28| aye. Aye. Opposed? No. We need a roll call with the noes. Four. We've got Sam. Four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=928)|

| 0:17:53| I would move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| Mr. Chairman, if I could, I'd like to recuse myself for being employed by the city. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| benefit from it, but I think it would be easier to recuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1085)|
| 0:18:12| I'm voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1095)|

| 0:18:48| Mr. Chairman, before I make a motion, I would like to change that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| and give you a little bit of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| Mr. Jarrett has talked with some of the students at UT who are willing to do the study that was mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1138)|
| 0:19:08| at our intergovernmental meeting about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| They've agreed to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| I would like to change that to 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| Can you complete that in 90 days, do you think, Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| I'm working with the Institute for Public Service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| and they'll actually be using Ph.D. candidates to do some empirical research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| and data in terms of trends and in terms of identifying certain regions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| that would be more suitable to underage drinkers to frequent based upon the nature of the identification checks, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1172)|
| 0:19:40| Do you think it would be safe then changing that to 90 days rather than six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| I believe we can get a survey done by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| I'd like to make a motion that we extend it for 90 days based on waiting on this study to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1188)|
| 0:19:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| Probably moved and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| I had my light on because I was going to bring up what Commissioner Brown just talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| about what Mr. Jarrett was going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| Commissioner Brown, are you sure that you want to cut it all the way to 90 and not at least, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| if it's going to take them 90 days to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| it might take another month just to make sure that we have it in our hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| or the commission has it in their hands to make appropriate action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| I just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| I work at a university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| I would hate for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| Make it 120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| That's what I was getting ready to say, make it 120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| Okay, 120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| So that you get at least an extra month in there built in in case the moratorium runs out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| and you don't have to go back and ask for another temporary moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| I'll amend that to 120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| Second, okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| And I'll recuse, even though it's only modestly associated with the University of Tennessee where I work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1249)|
| 0:20:59| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| We have two recusals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| Who's the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| Just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Brad, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| I was on the land acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| I was on the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| Just one recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| Mr. Chairman, a quick follow-up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| We will be starting back our, well, for want of a better word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| we're going to call it the beer committee, beer study committee, here this next month, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1286)|
| 0:21:33| LL for me, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| Tell you what, Commissioner Brown, let me know when it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| Will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1297)|

| 0:23:35| The only reason that we would have someone fill this slot is if the governor were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| to provide a special session, if there were an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| But we could always swear someone in if we wanted to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| The cost of filling that seat temporarily would be approximately $6,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| I called Nashville and asked them to give me the approximate cost of filling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| It's actually $58.27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| There's salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| There would be benefits involved, office allocation, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| And if there were a special session, of course, that person would be available to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| I'm told that Senator Woodson would be very capable of handling any constituent issues for six weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1447)|
| 0:24:14| which is basically what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| Or you have Patsy Miller, who is in the legislative office, who could handle any constituent issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| And I'm also told that Mr. Burchett himself, even though he would not be a senator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| would be willing to send people in the right direction, in other words, to do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| So I point out the fact that we can fill the seat if we want to, but we are not, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1470)|
| 0:24:36| Mr. Chair, legally obligated to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| We could leave the seat vacant until the election and let whoever is elected then be sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1478)|
| 0:24:44| Actually, Commissioner, respectfully, and I know that we discuss this back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1484)|
| 0:24:49| but the state constitution does use the term shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| It actually reads, when less than 12 months remain prior to the next general election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| a successor shall be elected by the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| I know that it seems ludicrous for two months, but the state constitution is using the mandatory shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1501)|
| 0:25:08| If they say shall, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| Is there a time frame on shall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| Less than 12 months, he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| No, it's as if it occurs less than 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| In other words, if there's less than 12 months left, you appoint, even if it's for two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| And even though there's an expense attached to it, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| Joe, does not Mr. Canfield hold this position until November?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| He's a state rep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| And he's got an opponent in the Democratic Party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| He's not even been elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| That's what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| He may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| He's not elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| I mean, he's got an opponent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| I know he has an opponent, but somebody will be elected in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| Whoever is elected in November, once they certify, they can take off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| That's what I was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| Immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| Immediately, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| So we're talking about two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| They would have to surrender the seat on November 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| So, well, no, the election would be the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| It's not certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| They have ten days to certify the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| Once it's certified, that person then will surrender the seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| I don't think we have a choice, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| What's your recommendation if you'll give a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| Well, I was going to suggest that, well, there are a couple of options, that we, on September 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| we're having a meeting that day with the 11-member body that we go ahead and start accepting resumes now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| The media can let people know that there is a vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| I think the word will spread very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| And we could actually fill the vacancy on September 1st during our special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| We could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| Or we could wait or have a special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| Or we could do it during our regular meeting of September 20th or the 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1598)|
| 0:26:44| And you're only talking about a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| So you're talking about a month to fill it, and then you're, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| So if we want to do it right away, September 1st would be the ideal time to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| since we're meeting that day anyway for reorganization purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| Does that shall mean immediately, or can you say you're going to appoint in November?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1615)|
| 0:27:04| And then the election will take care of itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| Maybe it deals with county seats, but I thought there was a time that you had to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| whether it was 60 or 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| I thought that came up before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| That's county elective bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| But, you know, you're dealing here with the state constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| and it reads that if a vacancy occurs and there's less than 12 months before the next election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| the local legislative body shall appoint someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| What's the penalty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| There's no penalty attached, but you took an oath to uphold the constitution of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| My recommendation would be, regardless of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| I won't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| Dickens once said that the law is a buffoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| And he might not have used the word buffoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| but he used a derogatory term describing the law, and this seems to be one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| Can I nominate Mark Harmon to fill that position until election time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| I promise to serve without salary, recycle my stationery, and do absolutely nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1673)|
| 0:28:00| You have to become a Republican.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| Sometimes you ask too much of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| Well, Mr. Chairman, I'll go ahead and make a motion so that we can get it on the floor for discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| that we go ahead and begin accepting resumes immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| and that we fill the vacancy on September 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| that we have the public hearing after reorganization for those candidates interested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| and we vote on September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| Can I make a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| Can I ask the law director to contact the state attorney general and ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| between now and September 1st, and ask if we have to fill it if there's a --?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| No, we don't have to fill it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| Can we ask the state attorney general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| get a pending from the state attorney general prior to September 1st, still accepting the resumes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| Yes, I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| But Tank, you said we didn't have to fill it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| That's my new job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| You have to become a Republican.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| Yes, I'll accept that, that we go ahead and begin accepting resumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| If the attorney general comes back and says, no, you can wait two months, then we can say no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| but I think we need to go ahead and move the process in case it says shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| Okay, I am a Republican.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| You guys need to get your resumes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| Well, it's kind of useless if he says we don't have to for these guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| No, we have to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| Even if he tells us no, I think you'll need to accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| Who's a second to take that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| I'll accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| I think this is an important position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| I think it should be filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| I know I don't like to spend money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| but I don't think it's wasting money either to have someone in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| I think that what this person may do for the constituents, the possibility of a special session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1787)|
| 0:29:57| I think the folks of this senatorial district deserve to be represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| even if it is only for a short period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| I do think it needs to be someone who's qualified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| someone who will work at it and do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| They live in that district, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| They must live in that district, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| They have to be qualified to be able to run for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| The qualifications to run for it, to be appointed, is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| My only question is, getting back to the date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| is that there must be a vacancy for ten days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1830)|
| 0:30:35| so the vacancy really doesn't occur until September 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1835)|
| 0:30:42| If the law director can look into making sure we stay within the state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| because I know there's a, you have to advertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| and there must be a vacancy for ten days before we can appoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| How long does it take the government to call for a special session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| Not long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| You don't have any idea either?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| I don't know, but he could do it fairly quickly, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1864)|
| 0:31:11| Well, you know, we have to advertise our special meetings for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| I just wondered if he had to do that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| Well, even when we do, it's only a matter of days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| and if it's an emergency, it can even be shorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| So, I mean, a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| I just think that when someone in that district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| if something were to crop up that they need to have their senator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1892)|
| 0:31:40| represent them at the state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| they deserve someone that lives in their district to be their senator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| Well, you're right, if they have a special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| But I'd like to make an amendment to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| that if you make an appointment between now and then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| whoever's elected, whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| I would have got one amendment to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| Well, as soon as the election is certified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| that person immediately becomes the, gets the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| And so there would just be an automatic changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| Okay, so you're just talking about maybe a month and a half at the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| Maybe a month and a half, but you just never know what could crop up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1936)|
| 0:32:22| I've had my light on for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| Cut it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| Oh, Paul, I'm going to miss you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| You can't see it from over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| Oh, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| Is that better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| Is that better, guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| Well, I would like to, in the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| say that instead of voting for this on September 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| I'd like to go ahead and do the public meeting on September 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| but then give us some time to, because it's only, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| a week and a half until September 1st to get resumes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| and do any kind of interviewing that we might want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| with the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| And then that just seems like a really compressed process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| I would actually like to have a little more time to reflect on that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| before I vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| And Mark actually does live in the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| He is very well versed in constituency needs and services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| and that seat wasn't always held by a Republican,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| and it may not be in the future either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| Well, I mean, let me turn my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| Commissioner Saunders, is that your light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| Commissioner McKitt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| Well, I guess I'll say the other side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| In the past, hadn't it been, I know, and I think I was appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| and maybe I asked Dave and Dr. Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| wasn't it kind of a one, we came in here and interviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| and then 11 or so commissioners voted for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| I don't think that was a two-step process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| There sort of was, because the commission at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| they went around to each district and interviewed people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| because I know there was a session out at Farragut where they interviewed the people there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| and there were some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| And then we came down here the day again when they were appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| I think we've done it both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| We've had the public hearing immediately, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2068)|
| 0:34:34| followed by the special meeting that appointed someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| And then we've had it where we've had one day we interviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| and then another day we've done the actual appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| Yeah, I just like with, you know, school just started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| and all of that is happening next week, the swearing in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| and I just like a little more time, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| Well, he's checking to make sure if it can actually be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| or if you have to wait the 10 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| That's my question is, because I know that you have to wait 10 days once there's a vacancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| and there's not a vacancy until September 1 unless Mayor-elect Merchant resigned his Senate seat prior to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2108)|
| 0:35:18| So you're saying maybe on the 1st we could interview and then if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| And then appoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| 11th or whatever, 10 days, however the lawyer says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| That would be the safest thing to do, interview on the 1st and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| So I'll amend my motion to say that we would accept resumes through the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| We will interview on September 1 after the reorganization and then meet in 10 days or whenever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| Well, you might want to take a look at a calendar real quick and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| I don't know what the 10th is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| Is that 10 working days or just 10 calendar days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| I believe it's just 10 calendar days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| It is 10 calendar days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| I don't know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| Friday, September the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| Well, then the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| The 11th would not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| The 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| That would be Monday the 13th, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| We come in on Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| I don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| We come in on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| Anything else on the commissioner, Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| Yeah, I think there's a few other things I'd like to check on in regards to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| I think state senators may get the availability for insurance for life if they're appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| And so we need to make sure that there's cost effect for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| And I want to check on that before we appoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| And I still want to check with the AG and see if we have to appoint since it's such a six-week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| with the cost of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| Well, you know, state constitution is fairly plain on its face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| The AG's opinion, of course, you realize is just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| It's an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| It's not law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| He's the one that got us all messed up in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| Current limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| His opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| Two of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| So what's the will of the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| Commissioner Hammond, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| The motion is that we go ahead and accept the resumes through the commission office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| that we hold a public hearing September 1st after reorganization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| pursuant to a date after the law director tells us the date that we can, if it's ten days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2234)|
| 0:37:20| then I guess we can decide September 1st on the date that we'll actually have the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| Can we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| Now, it is true that unless there is a special called meeting by the governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2250)|
| 0:37:37| there will be no meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| They're out of session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| Under the executive power, he can convene by proclamation an emergency session of the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| But that's what it would take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| Next is resolution 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| I request that the Knox County Law Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| and the Knox County Finance Director provide the Knox County Commission with, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| efforts to recover public monies unless they have been misappropriated by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| and or improperly paid to Knox County employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| and, number two, the status of the TBI investigation of former Knox County trustee employee John Hahn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2299)|
| 0:38:26| Finance, 8-0 to approve with amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| And the governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| 6-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| I have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| What was the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| Mike, what was the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| I don't remember the amendment on finance, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| I don't remember what the amendment was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| I believe the amendment was to also ask finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| Oh, it was from Dave Wright, who said that there was some audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| That's what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| You said include the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| There were a couple other oddities that came out of the last year internal audit from the external auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2336)|
| 0:39:08| And the reason I had my light on is the audit committee meets September the 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| The audit committee meets September the 7th at 8.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2355)|
| 0:39:23| Commissioners, I spoke with the district state attorney general regarding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2363)|
| 0:39:30| TBI will not comment on the ongoing investigations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| They said they're working with the state comptroller and they're backed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| Relative to the specific employee, I did confer with his attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| We are working with our pension folks for him to surrender his pension and then make up any disparity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2380)|
| 0:39:47| I'm waiting for the exact figure to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| That's about as much information as I was able to get, especially from TBI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| They're not talking at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| So we've had no restitution at all yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2402)|
| 0:40:12| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| Mr. Chairman, I'm going to, since I do work in the trustee's office, I'm going to recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2419)|
| 0:40:26| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| I don't have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| We have a motion to approve, but we do not have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| And that's with the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2435)|
| 0:40:40| Everyone ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| I guess I need to recuse myself, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| I know someone that works here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| One recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| If I could, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| Apologize, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| I was able to pull up the attorney general actually has a database of his most current opinions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2456)|
| 0:41:03| and he has stated in his most recent opinion the county commission must fill a vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2463)|
| 0:41:09| It is not a discretionary function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| It must be done so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| He does then continue saying, however, the constitution does not provide for a penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2473)|
| 0:41:19| But, again, it is mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| The AG, the only opinion they've issued said you shall do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| There is no discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| Any time period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2488)|

| 0:41:41| The Notts County resolution 908 is requesting that the Notts County trustee elect confer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| with the city of Nottsville revenue office to explore the feasibility of combining the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| city and county tax offices for the purpose of tax collection and to consider sending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| out tax statements in a single envelope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2514)|

| 0:42:10| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| I'm probably second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| Again, I'm going to recuse myself since this is dealing with the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2534)|
| 0:42:20| You just need to go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| I'm ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| Do we have anyone here from the trustee's office that can speak to this as far as their feelings on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2544)|
| 0:42:37| We know that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| Then are we shooting in the dark here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| Are we doing what we're asking for or where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| I brought this forward because, as Commissioner Pinkston said earlier, Dr. Walker was part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| of that efficiency panel that made this recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| We also had the recommendation made by a second efficiency panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| At the time, it wasn't feasible because of the climate in Notts County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| It may still not be feasible because the city has to agree to it, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| But we have found that if you're looking for efficiencies, that's one way of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| Because as you go up on the third floor, you turn to the left of the city, right to the county, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| And so we have encouraged the two bodies to get together to talk about it, to discuss feasibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2598)|
| 0:43:24| That hasn't happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| And so we're just kind of revisiting it and saying with a new administration, new trustee, something for you to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2605)|
| 0:43:31| They may not do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| It's merely a suggestion from a former efficiency panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| I just wanted to bring it out there so it wouldn't get lost in the shuffle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| So this is an official request to ask them to do that then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| Yes, to consider it and to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| It's not saying you have to do it, but just saying, hey, this was a recommendation, would you look at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2626)|
| 0:43:52| Are you putting that in the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| I think it's already been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| Yes, and I'll vote in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| I'd just like to remind everybody the city mayor controls the revenue office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| so he would be the person you'd have to contact, not the office itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| I mean, the office wouldn't have the opportunity to go through the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| Yes, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| And so this would be for the trustee to talk with whoever would be appropriate to begin those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2656)|
| 0:44:24| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| Yes, what I was going to say, we have to be very careful with this because the city gives discounts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2667)|
| 0:44:33| and they slip a little thing in there telling how much you get for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| And we might, you know, the people might think that means the county too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| And it could really cut down on our revenue if we aren't careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| I don't know how you could handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| But I think the city gives you, if you pay it in October, Ed, you probably know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| It's 1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| If you pay it in the first, within 30 days, it's 1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| Whatever it is, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| So, you know, we could cause some confusion there with the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2697)|
| 0:45:05| We just raise our taxes 1% and then offer them the same deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| I was kind of wondering maybe along the way if we could move Ordinance 101 up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| I noticed that Dr. Buchanan has been sitting down there for about six hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| It just crossed my mind earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| That was just off the top of my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| Oh, she was just enjoying herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2726)|
| 0:45:31| Yeah, she brought her supper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| Y'all ready to vote on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| What's the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| Motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| As has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2745)|

| 0:47:27| County Public Building Authority and the services it provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| gebaut approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| The governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| 5-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| So move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| Properly moved and seconded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| Well, it was kind of in that similar vein to Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| I'd like to, it's not associated with this, it's that ordinance on second reading I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| like to pull forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| We have some people here to speak on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2871)|
| 0:47:59| All in favor of this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2883)|
| 0:48:08| Second reading ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| Okay, this is Ordinance 0-10-7-101, amending Chapter 12 of the Knox County Code entitled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2889)|
| 0:48:18| Businesses, by adding a new Article 4 to prohibit a business or entity in possession of a Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2898)|
| 0:48:26| County business license from knowingly employing an illegal alien and providing for penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2906)|
| 0:48:32| This amends Knox County Code, Chapter 12, establishing Article 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| This is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2916)|

| 0:48:41| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| Mr. Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| We have some people who want to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| I've got them, but I'm going to get a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2924)|
| 0:48:55| Well, I'd like to make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| I'd like to make a substitute motion to defer 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| Bob Bowman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2951)|
| 0:49:12| I need your name and address in five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2952)|
| 0:49:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| Thank you, Commissioner McKenzie, for mercy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| I've been here all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| I'm feeling good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| Six minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2965)|
| 0:49:26| My name is Bob Bowman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| I'm an attorney at the Kramer Racing Firm, 800 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| I am here tonight on behalf of several clients whom I represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| I represent many fast food franchisees across the state, many of whom are based here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2977)|
| 0:49:46| They, in principle, support Commissioner Pinkston's idea that illegal immigrants should not be working in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2986)|
| 0:49:57| But they have a great fear for what this resolution or this ordinance may do to their business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=2997)|
| 0:50:03| and that is if they lose their business license for one day, they may see their franchise pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3003)|
| 0:50:10| My clients employ hundreds, if not thousands, of people in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| They have millions of dollars invested in buildings in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| and they are very afraid that a single mistake by a rogue manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3020)|
| 0:50:27| or an intentional act by a disgruntled manager could cost them millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3027)|
| 0:50:35| and could cost Knox County hundreds of jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| Our concern, members of the commission, is that the language in section 12-82 is vague| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3039)|
| 0:50:49| in that it just says a business shall not knowingly hire, employ, contract with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3049)|
| 0:50:55| or otherwise utilize services of an illegal alien.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| Ladies and gentlemen, a business, a building, does not make hiring and firing decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| It's managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3064)|
| 0:51:05| And under agency law in the state of Tennessee, if a manager, no matter how low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| makes a hiring decision that's improper under this ordinance, my clients could lose their franchise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3071)|
| 0:51:17| could lose their investment, could lose hundreds of jobs in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| We would ask that you defer this ordinance for 30 days so that we can work with the law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3082)|
| 0:51:30| to put some safeguards in section 12-82 that would protect legitimate business owners in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3090)|
| 0:51:38| from losing their investment, many of whom have been in this business for 50 and 60 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3098)|
| 0:51:44| by putting these safeguards in so that because of a rogue manager or a disgruntled manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3104)|
| 0:51:51| will not cause them to lose their investment by a decision that they make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| some of which can be made, those decisions can be made by a night shift manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| when the home office is closed and there's no personnel manager to consult with about hiring decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3120)|
| 0:52:07| We're also concerned about the Title VII issues that 12-82 brings up that requires a business to contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3127)|
| 0:52:20| or the ICE agency should they suspect a job applicant is an illegal alien.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| Ladies and gentlemen, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, as of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3145)|
| 0:52:30| prohibits an employer from having a policy that you cannot hire someone because they've been convicted of a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3150)|
| 0:52:38| It is very hard to operate a business and manage your employees with regulations that government's putting on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3158)|
| 0:52:44| And while we don't disagree with the principle that Mr. Commissioner Pinkston is trying with this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3164)|
| 0:52:52| this regulation is compounded with other regulations that my clients have to deal with on a daily basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| and this one has more severe consequences than any regulation or ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| or law that the federal government has imposed on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| And the third thing that, and this is what really scares my clients to death,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| is the fact that the very first offense results in the suspension of a county-issued business license for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3191)|
| 0:53:17| And that very thing is what can cost my clients their franchise, can cost them millions of dollars in investment in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3197)|
| 0:53:24| it can cost hundreds if not thousands of jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| At the very least, if you did not defer this ordinance to give us time to work with the law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| to come up with some acceptable language which would have a safeguard in it to protect legitimate business owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3213)|
| 0:53:40| who are trying to do the right thing, we would at least pray you that you change the first offense to only a fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3220)|
| 0:53:48| so that whatever occurred that my clients can try to correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| But we don't disagree with the good intentions that Commissioner Pinkston is trying to implement through this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3232)|
| 0:54:00| Certainly, I think many of us are troubled by the lack of action by our federal government on these immigration issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3240)|
| 0:54:06| But this has some very unintended consequences which could have grave effects for many, many hardworking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3246)|
| 0:54:16| blue-blooded American employers in Knox County, and I'd ask that you please defer it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3256)|
| 0:54:24| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3267)|
| 0:54:28| And I really thank you for bringing all that to light, because I don't think those were things that we had fully vetted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3268)|
| 0:54:35| you know, when this ordinance, speaking for me personally, when I was considering this ordinance on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3275)|
| 0:54:41| You know, that's the business case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| I think there's also a community case spoken with Mr. Velasquez and Mr. Martinez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3284)|
| 0:54:50| And, you know, in terms of a dialogue, how to help prevent these issues from coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3290)|
| 0:54:58| I think we need to engage the whole community in trying to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3298)|
| 0:55:05| brainstorm and find ways to prevent these things from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| So, you know, if we're going, that's why I will be in favor of deferring for 30 days as well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3309)|
| 0:55:16| so that they can get involved in this debate and dialogue, because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| that's something that they're in favor of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| I mean, you know, we're all wanting to do the right things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| I just think we need to make sure that everyone's voice has been heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| and ideals have been considered as to how we get to where this ordinance is originally intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3331)|
| 0:55:40| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| I agree this first penalty may be a little harsh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| but we have to do something to correct this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| Now, the government has a program set up, E-Verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| You don't have to call the Social Security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| You call E-Verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3353)|
| 0:55:54| They'll tell you whether these are illegals or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| We already have people here in Knoxville, Tennessee, abiding by that law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| These illegals right now in incarceration are costing Knox County $2,771,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3361)|
| 0:56:12| Now, how much are they costing us in our health care with this indigent care program we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| We have to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| I'm pro-business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| I'm sure everybody up here knows this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| But we have to take a step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| Now, everybody has always hollered, well, we don't need to punish the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| We need to stop it by stopping the jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| Now, a manager should not be allowed to hire anybody unless he clears it through the company with E-Verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3391)|
| 0:56:38| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| Now, if you've got a district manager, he should not be allowed to hire anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3400)|
| 0:56:46| Even a manager shouldn't be allowed to hire anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| And I also propose, if this passes, that we put it on new business license, that they can lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3408)|
| 0:56:55| What can happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3415)|
| 0:56:56| They can be fined or lose their business license if they do not abide by this law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| Now, this law is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| There are still going to be people who break this law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| This law is not going to be or this ordinance is not going to be against the people that want to hire people, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3425)|
| 0:57:11| It is a deterrent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| People that want to do business properly, it's a deterrent to keep them from doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| If they don't have to contact E-Verify or anything, they're liable to hire anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| It's just exactly like your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| You lock the door to keep the honest man from coming in because the crook is going to come in anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3446)|
| 0:57:32| We have to do something on this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| Now, I would say if we're spending $2,771,000 for incarceration, that's $74 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3454)|
| 0:57:43| I would say these people going to the emergency room is a lot more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3463)|
| 0:57:47| We're talking about roughly 100 inmates that's costing us that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| How many do we have here in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| Our county cannot keep up with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| Right now, we're having a hard time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| Plus, it's not just the jobs that we're losing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| It's not just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3483)|
| 0:58:04| We can no longer pay for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| It's not just Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| It's the whole country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| We can't pay for this anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| We have to do something to stop these people from coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| We know they're recruiting here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| That was proven when they had this van wreck down in Lenoir City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| and they interviewed these illegals and they said the reason they were coming here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| they were headed to Knoxville because they were promised jobs here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| All I'm saying is we need to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| You can hold the meetings you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3513)|
| 0:58:34| I won't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| But something needs to be done and it rests on the back of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| It will be 11 members here to try to do something to stop this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3519)|
| 0:58:48| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| We have a motion on the floor to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3529)|
| 0:58:56| That's a two-motion, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| Motion passes 18-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3546)|
| 0:59:12| 17-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| We're back on page 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| Resolution 9-1-1 is regarding proposed amendments to the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3558)|
| 0:59:23| as recommended by the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| 8-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| Say what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| 8-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| 6-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3582)|
| 0:59:43| You do have, excuse me, Commissioner, you do have to actually select a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| and date and place if you look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| And that's something that during your meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| it was decided that you would determine that today in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| when you're going to conduct those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3596)|
| 1:00:03| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| I think the motion I'd like to make, I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3606)|
| 1:00:12| is what I felt like and I think what the Rules Committee kind of felt like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3612)|
| 1:00:20| and we can have discussion about it, is that on the Monday that would have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| the finance meeting would be a work session that where we take votes on issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3624)|
| 1:00:31| and every unanimous vote becomes a consent item for the next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3631)|
| 1:00:39| And then we have discussion and a vote or a vote to pass to the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3639)|
| 1:00:46| all the other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| The reason that I brought this before the Rules Committee was when we went down to 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3649)|
| 1:00:56| it seemed like it was redundant to have a finance meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| and an intergovernmental committee when they were both essentially doing the same thing two days in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3659)|
| 1:01:06| The department heads were coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| We're wasting a whole lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| And so what I would like to propose and make a motion is that we have the work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3672)|
| 1:01:20| and it doesn't matter to me if it's morning or afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| on the day that the money that the finance committee met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| and your commission be the next following Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3687)|
| 1:01:34| So what you're saying is the Monday preceding the regular scheduled meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3694)|
| 1:01:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| And it's up for discussion on if you want to have it at 8.30 like we had finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| or if you want to have it at 2 o'clock like we have commissioned to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3704)|
| 1:01:53| You finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| I guess Commissioner Anderson, make that correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| would it be either the Monday or the first business day of the week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| Yeah, because of holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| Because of holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| You finished, Commissioner Luto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| I'm just trying to help out my fellow commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| One thing to think about is that right now the finance committee approves line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3732)|
| 1:02:21| It doesn't come before the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| So you all need to decide at what point do you want to approve line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3743)|
| 1:02:32| Either do that at this workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| If it's consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| Or, well, see, it doesn't even come before us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| Or do it at the regular or just vote at it at the regular commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3760)|
| 1:02:44| I think make those a regular agenda item and just vote on them at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| If it's unanimous, it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| I'm just pointing out right now it only comes before finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| It doesn't come before the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| So that's just a decision that needs to be made at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3775)|
| 1:02:59| Just one of the consequences of doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| So that you would want that change to be done as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| Make it a line item, agenda item, and you approve it or discuss it in the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| If it's consent, it goes to consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| I agree with Mr. Andrews about parts of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| and that is that probably some of the things that we've been doing have not worked very well in committee in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3803)|
| 1:03:30| for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| But given the changes that we're about to go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| and I just think it would be wise, since we know how the committee system works and it functions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3816)|
| 1:03:44| and possibly it will function better if we tweak it a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3824)|
| 1:03:49| it would be my preference that we take Mr. Anders' idea and put it, kind of shelve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3829)|
| 1:03:58| for at least a couple of months and then see how this thing is working in the new commission format,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3838)|
| 1:04:07| because we already know how to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| We know how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3850)|
| 1:04:11| We know the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| We know how votes are taken, how resolutions are sent, recommendations are made, how the clerk works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3852)|
| 1:04:19| We know all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3859)|
| 1:04:20| And otherwise, we're kind of fuzzy on some few things, not the least of which is line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3860)|
| 1:04:27| So it would be, I'd like to make a substitute motion that we keep our intergovernmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3867)|
| 1:04:34| and finance committee structure as it is for at least the time being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3874)|
| 1:04:39| and we take that up at some later time as we see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3879)|
| 1:04:46| I mean, legally, but not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| We have a second to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3894)|
| 1:04:59| Seeing none, then substitute motion dies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| And I'll speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| I thought Commissioner Briggs had the floor before me, but I'll just speak to I like this idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3907)|
| 1:05:14| I think it gives us an opportunity to actually dig deeper into the issues of the day or of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3914)|
| 1:05:23| You know, I've heard a lot of other good ideas that I think will support this work, whatever you call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3923)|
| 1:05:30| pre-session and then help the commission meeting go a little less than eight hours as it's gone today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3930)|
| 1:05:39| So one, I guess, request from a working staff is that, and two, I think it will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3939)|
| 1:05:46| it will show a little flexibility in when people can come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| If we could push that work session back to, say, four o'clock instead of a two o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3949)|
| 1:05:54| that really kind of chops up the middle of the day for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3954)|
| 1:05:58| but then also for folks that want to come here and present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| I know it keeps the staff here, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| pretty much all of the staff members that present to us are department heads and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| and I think they're probably salaried employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| so I don't see it being a cost issue associated with paying these folks overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3970)|
| 1:06:18| But, you know, what we're talking about is once a month that that will go from four o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3978)|
| 1:06:27| and I don't know how long it will go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| I don't think it will go this long, so just something to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3988)|
| 1:06:35| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| I'd like to make a substitute motion that we defer the decision on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| until the new commission is sitting for several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4001)|
| 1:06:45| One, it's the new commission that's going to have to play by these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| One of the other issues that we're going to have to decide if we decide to do it tonight is when the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4009)|
| 1:06:54| what Sam was just referring to, when does the meeting occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| It seemed like it would be better for the people that are going to have to live with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| but for them to decide just, you know, for an example, Jeff Owenby has a job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| and it seems like he should have a little input into when this is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4027)|
| 1:07:11| rather than a bunch of people who are many people who aren't going to be on the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4031)|
| 1:07:15| deciding what the rules and the time we meet for the other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| And we could defer this until after the new commission is sworn in to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| and let the people who are going to be on the commission decide what rules they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| Can I speak to that, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| Does he have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| Yeah, I need to get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| The reason, and I thought about that, and I kind of waited until after the election cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4055)|
| 1:07:41| there's only one that's not going to sit on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| He came to the work session that we had as far as a rules committee, and I spoke personally with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| and he does have a working job like some or most of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| and he said that, you know, whether it was in the morning or whether it was in the afternoon, he didn't care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| but he agreed with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4078)|
| 1:08:01| That's not what he told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| Uh-oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| He told me that he would prefer to have it after 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4086)|
| 1:08:12| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4092)|
| 1:08:13| Well, I mean, in the afternoon, but he didn't, he wasn't, the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| he agreed with the work session and then the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| I was talking about the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| Well, I mean, any time that, I mean, I think it's, you know, 2 or 4 o'clock is good either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4101)|
| 1:08:28| But I think there's only one person that's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| And I thought about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| I really did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| And if it had been a major change in the staffing here, I wouldn't have considered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4114)|
| 1:08:39| But I think as we go to September the 1st to set up with the committee on committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4119)|
| 1:08:45| and then to have to disperse all that, it makes no sense if we can, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4125)|
| 1:08:50| if this idea doesn't work, then let's not do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| Give it six months if it doesn't work, if it's not efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| I think it's going to be more efficient because we're not hearing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| if you set up in the current structure, you've got six and five on committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4140)|
| 1:09:05| If two's not there, you don't have a quorum on a lot of votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| And so we've got to be careful of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| And I think that this makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4149)|
| 1:09:15| If it begins not to make sense or if it doesn't work, we can switch it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| But I think it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4158)|
| 1:09:25| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| I agree with Commissioner Anders in that I think that it does make sense that full commission would meet the Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4170)|
| 1:09:38| before regular county commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4178)|
| 1:09:43| And I really had my light on saying that regular county commission is the fourth Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4183)|
| 1:09:50| Is that what we're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| Unless it's a holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| So this meeting we're talking about, which would be a single meeting or a unified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| or a combined or whatever we want to refer to that as, would be the Monday or the working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4200)|
| 1:10:07| Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| The first working day, first business day of the week preceding the regular commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4210)|
| 1:10:18| Now, you've got to remember in November and December, that's the third week of the month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4218)|
| 1:10:25| because of the two holidays, Thanksgiving and Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4228)|
| 1:10:29| So we'll change the schedule then it looks like as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| I mean, all of this is open and flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| That's the only thing I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| I think I can remember in the short time that I've been here that the two committees did meet on the same day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4237)|
| 1:10:44| at one point in time, maybe even met together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| When we were 11 because of the first round of appointments were tossed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4247)|
| 1:10:53| and before we made the second round of appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| we had a combined intergovernmental and finance that Commissioner Pinkston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4256)|
| 1:11:04| and I were the two chairmen at the time of those two committees and we conducted a joint meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4264)|
| 1:11:13| but we still took separate votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| But it actually worked better when they were back-to-back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| So, I mean, that was just, I think there's good merit to what Commissioner Andrews is proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4281)|
| 1:11:29| but I'm not going to be here and I'll vote the will of those that are going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| So I think what we're trying to really establish right now is just something to get us through the month of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4295)|
| 1:11:42| We will meet on September and we have a couple of things on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| Maybe this needs to be an agenda item or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| To say that that third Monday that the entire commission will meet at a certain time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4313)|
| 1:11:59| to have voting authority and establish a consent calendar and discuss everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4319)|
| 1:12:08| Whatever is unanimous is consent and whatever is not is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| And come regular commission day, if someone wants to pull something off consent, as we do now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4333)|
| 1:12:20| we can still do that then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| So I believe this is only a logical progression of the voters of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4343)|
| 1:12:29| desiring that we be a smaller commission, that we take up less time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| and that we take up less time of the people that appear before us here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4353)|
| 1:12:38| and not have two committee meetings but just have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| I'm fully in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| I was just going to ask on Commissioner Briggs' substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| are you suggesting that we talk about it September the 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4370)|
| 1:12:54| Because if not, then you're going to go through the whole process of selecting intergovernmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| and finance people and, in other words, you're going through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| and you're going to end up with two meetings for the month of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| So I guess I'm following on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| Let's go ahead and decide today if we're going to meet as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4387)|
| 1:13:11| I like the idea of having everybody meet together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4391)|
| 1:13:15| Well, you know, I do, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4395)|
| 1:13:16| That wasn't my purpose on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| I tell you what it really was more than anything was setting the time of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| Because if we vote here, there's some people who are leaving who don't have regular jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| It might say it doesn't matter and vote for it to be at 830 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| I think there's others, probably the majority that are going to be on the new commission work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4410)|
| 1:13:38| And, you know, it's really the time that I was more concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| I think the people that are going to be on the commission ought to decide what time it's going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| not people that are leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| That was my only concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| So would you amend your motion to say let's go ahead and meet as a full committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| and maybe establish the time on September 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| I'm just trying to come up with a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| Just so it's the new commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4437)|
| 1:14:05| No, I'm asking if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| I mean, is that your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| Would you make that as a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| My substitute motion was for us to decide this on September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| That's what I was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4456)|
| 1:14:17| But if we want to modify that, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4457)|
| 1:14:20| But I still think the people, you know, the people making the rules ought to be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| or the people that have to play by the rules ought to be the people making the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| Again, I would be in favor of going ahead and saying we're going to meet as a full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| If we want to wait on the time, we can do the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| But I think that's wise for us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| Jeff just texted me and said that 4 is preferable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4477)|
| 1:14:43| And that works, I think, for most everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| It lets the public come down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4485)|
| 1:14:49| So 4 o'clock, work session at 4 o'clock, the Monday previous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4489)|
| 1:14:54| and then your commission meeting would start at 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| and your beer board would be at 1 on the regular scheduled meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| That's the motion that I'm making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| I've got to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| If we do that, if we say that, you know, meet at 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| I like to talk sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| Whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| I would be willing to withdraw my substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4511)|
| 1:15:20| Are you withdrawing your substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| Yeah, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| I will if Brad is willing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4523)|
| 1:15:29| Set the time at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4529)|
| 1:15:30| Yeah, set the time at 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4530)|
| 1:15:35| Do you want to withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| So he has a substitute motion now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| He withdrew his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| Yeah, but he has to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4542)|
| 1:15:43| Will you withdraw your second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| But he doesn't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4546)|
| 1:15:47| I think the law director has chimed in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| If the second refuses to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4551)|
| 1:15:55| We changed our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4555)|
| 1:15:56| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4556)|
| 1:15:57| We changed our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| So basically it's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| So he can withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| Can I just make a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| So, Brad, do you have a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| No, he has the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| Original, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4571)|
| 1:16:12| He just set the time to 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| I'm in full agreement with the workshop slash voting session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4579)|
| 1:16:25| But it's been mentioned at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| When you look at it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| If we've got both groups together here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| we're all going to be getting into a deeper discussion of every item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4594)|
| 1:16:38| Some of these things in our intergovernmental meeting today, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| bam, bam, bam, we'll go through here and we're out in an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| That's not going to happen when you have a workshop session with everybody here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| It's going to be as long as a commission meeting if we let it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| So we need to move that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| We've got ladies up here, ladies over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| people coming down here to talk to us who are working, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| in county government too that we need to be speaking to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| We can't hold them all over here at night just because we want to have a workshop at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4624)|
| 1:17:08| We need to be doing it at their convention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| The more people we get here to give us information, the better decisions we can make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4630)|
| 1:17:16| And they need to be down here doing work in hours to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| They may need to be here, but you're excluding the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4642)|
| 1:17:23| And I think they're important too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| Well, they can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| They have the opportunity to be here on commission day just like they do have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4648)|
| 1:17:33| And the people in county government are paid to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| Not at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4656)|
| 1:17:37| Hey, Commissioner Brown, one thing I think is important to note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| that we don't have all the honorariums, we don't have any zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| we don't have any of the fluff that comes with a commission meeting in a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4664)|
| 1:17:50| It's just things you're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| And it's not, you know, we spent two hours today honoring those that have served,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4672)|
| 1:17:56| which is the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| But we wouldn't normally do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| We would just vote those honorariums on through on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4681)|
| 1:18:07| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| I agree in principle with these ideas that probably the combination will work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4690)|
| 1:18:16| and probably would be the way we would go eventually anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4696)|
| 1:18:20| I really am not liking this 4 o'clock idea at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4700)|
| 1:18:25| This is going to be long, grinding sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| Our staff is used to getting here the Monday before in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4708)|
| 1:18:33| and they're used to that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| Now, I got knocked out on my idea on that part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| I'm going to try to fight for a morning session then on the Monday before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| whatever the working day is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| I think it's good for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| I think it's good for these ladies right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| and it's good for the staff in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| There's very, very few people that are going to come to a work session of the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4733)|
| 1:18:59| unless they have a specific item, and they will come once every 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4739)|
| 1:19:05| And so I don't think accommodation of citizen en masse is going to be – it's our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4745)|
| 1:19:13| We're the ones that are doing the work, and the people in the county are doing the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| So I hope we'll think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4756)|
| 1:19:19| Mr. Schaff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4761)|
| 1:19:22| I support the want combining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| Instead of having to finance an interim government, I think one is much more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4765)|
| 1:19:30| And I would submit that these meetings would be roughly similar to our committee meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4770)|
| 1:19:37| because there we have 10 and 9, and we have 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| And as Brad or somebody just said, you don't have all the honorariums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| and you don't, you know, as long as we don't get into – rarely does it go past an hour and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| Usually we're gone by 10 o'clock, aren't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| So, I mean, and I guess we're going to have to vote on this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| because I think the 4 o'clock is just more conducive to public input for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4796)|
| 1:20:02| I just think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4802)|
| 1:20:03| And I would lean toward a 4 o'clock time as opposed to an early morning time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4803)|
| 1:20:10| I can't imagine them going past an hour and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| I don't think we'll get in these long drawn out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| Maybe we need to let these ladies and those ladies and the folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| You're out of order, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4818)|
| 1:20:24| I prefer 4, so I'll leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| Right now we only have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| We do not have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| I'd like to call for the dividing of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4834)|
| 1:20:39| The first part of the question would be to vote on whether or not to do away with the two committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4839)|
| 1:20:43| and to have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| And then the second part of the question as far as the times is to allow the commission when it reconvenes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4845)|
| 1:20:51| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4851)|
| 1:20:52| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| You said I didn't have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4858)|
| 1:20:59| I said we had a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| Without a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4861)|
| 1:21:02| No, I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| Yes, you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| Did I say without a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4865)|
| 1:21:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| We didn't have a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4867)|
| 1:21:08| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4868)|
| 1:21:09| We didn't have a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4869)|
| 1:21:10| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4870)|
| 1:21:11| I misspoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4871)|
| 1:21:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4872)|
| 1:21:13| What I'm saying is let's go ahead and vote on whether or not we want to have one workshop meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4873)|
| 1:21:22| and then allow the new commission when it reconvenes to decide what time they want to have their meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4882)|
| 1:21:31| because we can sit here all night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| And if you would agree to divide the question, let's go ahead and take care of, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| the part where I think most of us seem to think that they want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| and have made up their mind whether or not to combine and go down to one workshop type of committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4903)|
| 1:21:51| and then allow the new commission to decide then whether or not we want to vote on tonight on time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4911)|
| 1:22:00| or allow the commission in September to set that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4920)|
| 1:22:04| I'll take a friendly amendment to just get this thing rolling that we'll vote to change the structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4924)|
| 1:22:10| and then set the time on September the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| That's sort of where I'm going at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| I will amend my motion to that if the second will agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4935)|
| 1:22:19| Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| Brown, agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| So that just puts us at going ahead and combining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4945)|
| 1:22:28| And you guys can, when you reconvene, you can decide on your times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4948)|
| 1:22:34| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4954)|
| 1:22:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| I think this is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| I just wanted to say that I am in favor of the combined meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| but I'm very, very much opposed to a four o'clock meeting time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| That just, there are so many reasons that that's not going to be a good thing for a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4966)|
| 1:22:53| And I recognize that for people who have regular nine-to-five jobs that that works for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4973)|
| 1:23:02| but there are other people that it doesn't work for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| And so I hope that we will take everyone's needs into account when we talk about what time we're going to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4986)|
| 1:23:15| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4995)|
| 1:23:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| I'm in agreement with the motion that's on the floor that we have one meeting on the third Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=4998)|
| 1:23:25| and we have one meeting on the fourth Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| and that September the 1st those people that are members of that august body of Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5007)|
| 1:23:35| can decide what time they want to meet on the third Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| I support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| I approve that message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| Why can't we all vote now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| Because everyone turns their light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5028)|
| 1:23:53| No lights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5033)|
| 1:23:54| I better hurry up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5034)|
| 1:23:55| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5038)|
| 1:23:59| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5039)|
| 1:24:00| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5040)|
| 1:24:05| What's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| 9-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| This is a resolution for the purpose of requesting the incoming Knox County Mayor conduct an exhaustive review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5049)|
| 1:24:18| of the performance of the employees of the Knox County Solid Waste Division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5058)|
| 1:24:22| and report back to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5062)|
| 1:24:25| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| Eight-oh to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5068)|
| 1:24:29| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| Five-oh to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part4?start=5076)|
