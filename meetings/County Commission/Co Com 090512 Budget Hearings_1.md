| 2:24:55| In the past, we've often presented a budget that reflected real needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8695)|
| 2:25:00| but going in asking for more than we thought we would likely to get approved from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8700)|
| 2:25:06| This budget is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8706)|
| 2:25:08| We recognize the difficult economic situation we're all in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8708)|
| 2:25:12| so we've made a lot of difficult decisions, implemented tough cuts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8712)|
| 2:25:18| and are presenting a budget that is what we feel the Board of Education feels is the minimum we need to go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8718)|
| 2:25:25| and keep improving our schools for our students and getting great academic outcomes for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8725)|
| 2:25:30| So with that in mind, I respectfully request on behalf of the Board of Education that you approve our request for $375.25 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8730)|
| 2:25:41| which will be fully incorporated into Mayor Ragsdale's budget resolution that you'll be voting on soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8741)|
| 2:25:48| And I will turn it over to Dr. McIntyre to give you some more details, and I'll be happy to answer any questions, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8748)|
| 2:25:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8756)|
| 2:25:57| Mr. Chairman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8757)|
| 2:26:03| Thank you, Ms. Kincannon, and thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8763)|
| 2:26:05| We've had the opportunity to speak with the Commission in two parts, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8765)|
| 2:26:11| We came before both the Finance Committee and the Intergovernmental Relations Committee to talk about this budget in some detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8771)|
| 2:26:18| So I'm going to spend just a little bit of time walking you through the broad strokes of this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8778)|
| 2:26:24| It'll just take a few minutes to do that since most of you have basically heard the detailed presentation already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8784)|
| 2:26:30| but then I'll be glad to answer questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8790)|
| 2:26:33| Let me start by saying, as Ms. Kincannon did, this was a challenging budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8793)|
| 2:26:38| We faced difficult economic circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8798)|
| 2:26:41| And so in this situation, we tried very diligently to put together a budget that both responded to the economic circumstances that we face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8801)|
| 2:26:50| but also responded to the educational needs that we have and to organize our resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8810)|
| 2:26:58| and put together a budget that supports the education of our kids in a way that is both educationally appropriate and fiscally responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8818)|
| 2:27:08| So what you have before you is a balanced budget at $375.25 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8828)|
| 2:27:15| And when we look at our revenue picture, there's a little bit of a misconception, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8835)|
| 2:27:21| out in the public in that it's been characterized as about a 1.5 percent increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8841)|
| 2:27:27| And that's true when you look at the current year's appropriation versus next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8847)|
| 2:27:33| But what that does not take into consideration is that we saw additional revenues from the State of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8853)|
| 2:27:39| regarding an increase in enrollment that we saw this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8859)|
| 2:27:42| So we got an additional $4.6 million in revenues in the current year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8862)|
| 2:27:46| So when you take that into consideration, we're really talking about roughly level funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8866)|
| 2:27:50| in terms of the resources that we're requesting for the coming fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8870)|
| 2:27:56| We see property taxes up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8876)|
| 2:28:01| We see sales taxes down a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8881)|
| 2:28:03| And so this is, as I say, when you take into consideration all of the revenue sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8883)|
| 2:28:07| including the additional resources that we're receiving from the State of Tennessee regarding BEP enrollment increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8887)|
| 2:28:14| a roughly level-funded budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8894)|
| 2:28:16| When we looked at doing our business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8896)|
| 2:28:19| and we looked at what are the costs of doing our business and doing it well for next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8899)|
| 2:28:24| there are certain fixed costs that come into play before we even do anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8904)|
| 2:28:27| If we were to provide the same level of service to our students and our families for next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8907)|
| 2:28:32| there are certain things that will cost more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8912)|
| 2:28:34| And those include step increases for some of our employees who are eligible for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8914)|
| 2:28:40| some increases in our obligations around some of our retirement and pension programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8920)|
| 2:28:46| some of which have been closed for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8926)|
| 2:28:49| But when we look at the actuarial obligations that we have, those obligations increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8929)|
| 2:28:54| We're anticipating an increase in the cost of health insurance for next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8934)|
| 2:29:00| and not necessarily because we've seen any information about rate increases yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8940)|
| 2:29:04| but simply because we're seeing more people take advantage of the health insurance that's offered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8944)|
| 2:29:08| based on the fact that a spouse losing a job is a qualifying event for someone to come on to our health insurance program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8948)|
| 2:29:16| Utilities, debt service, those are all fixed costs that we're seeing for the coming fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8956)|
| 2:29:22| even before we think about any improvements or enhancements to the way that we do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8962)|
| 2:29:27| So as we looked at our budget, even before we move into the next fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8967)|
| 2:29:35| we're looking at a gap of somewhere in the neighborhood of about $8.5 million that we need to close in order to present a balanced budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8975)|
| 2:29:42| So we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8982)|
| 2:29:43| And how did we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8983)|
| 2:29:44| What are the strategies that we used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8984)|
| 2:29:46| Well, we basically have three places to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8986)|
| 2:29:48| One is what we call district-wide initiatives, and that's things like utilities and transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8988)|
| 2:29:53| and things of that nature that really affect us district-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8993)|
| 2:29:57| The other is our central office, and we looked very carefully at our central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8997)|
| 2:30:02| We looked at positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9002)|
| 2:30:03| We looked at all kinds of expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9003)|
| 2:30:05| We looked at everything that we do in our central office and made some fairly substantial reductions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9005)|
| 2:30:09| and some fairly deep cuts in the central office in order to balance this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9009)|
| 2:30:14| And then the third place that we looked is our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9014)|
| 2:30:17| and that's not our primary strategy in terms of balancing our budget was not looking at schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9017)|
| 2:30:23| but it does have to be part of the solution because most of our money is in people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9023)|
| 2:30:27| We're a very people-intensive business, and most of our people are in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9027)|
| 2:30:31| So we did take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9031)|
| 2:30:32| We think we did this in a fairly responsible way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9032)|
| 2:30:35| We developed what we call a budget allocation methodology or what can commonly be referred to as a budget formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9035)|
| 2:30:43| and that budget formula dictates how resources, how dollars are allocated out to schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9043)|
| 2:30:49| and we think this is a fair and sensible and transparent way for us to develop school budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9049)|
| 2:30:55| So we think that's a very good thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9055)|
| 2:30:57| However, we're doing it in a difficult economic environment, so unfortunately it was a net reduction overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9057)|
| 2:31:03| It turned out to be a net reduction of about 35 teacher positions overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9063)|
| 2:31:09| We also, as I mentioned when I came before the Commission Finance Committee and Intergovernmental Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9069)|
| 2:31:14| we also saw a reduction of about 35 or so custodial positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9074)|
| 2:31:19| We think that we can do our custodial services more efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9079)|
| 2:31:22| We think there's a value in continuing to do that service in-house because there's a pride of ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9082)|
| 2:31:29| Our folks do a great job, but we know we can do that more efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9089)|
| 2:31:32| So we're seeing reductions in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9092)|
| 2:31:35| All sorts of reductions in things like materials and travel and professional development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9095)|
| 2:31:41| types of costs that we've taken reductions to over time within this budget, supplies of materials, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9101)|
| 2:31:50| So those are some of the strategies that we used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9110)|
| 2:31:52| You may recall that one of the strategies we talked about was moving some of our high schools to a later start time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9112)|
| 2:31:57| and we thought that would save some $700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9117)|
| 2:32:00| We have applied some of the federal stimulus dollars that are coming to us through IDEA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9120)|
| 2:32:05| in order to stave off that particular reduction for at least two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9125)|
| 2:32:09| and give us more time to look at that option, look at whether that is something that we want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9129)|
| 2:32:14| whether that has educational benefits and merit or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9134)|
| 2:32:18| And so we believe we've staved that off for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9138)|
| 2:32:22| So we believe we've done a responsible job of putting together some strategies that will close that budget gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9142)|
| 2:32:28| and present to you a balanced budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9148)|
| 2:32:31| I'd like to just mention a couple of the investments that we've made within this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9151)|
| 2:32:35| because I think that's important for you to hear that we've really tried to make some investments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9155)|
| 2:32:40| that we've tried to put together a budget that is educationally sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9160)|
| 2:32:44| So some of the things that we've focused on within this budget and that we're investing in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9164)|
| 2:32:48| one is human capital and making sure that we have the best possible teachers in our classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9168)|
| 2:32:53| making sure that they are supported with the resources and professional development that they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9173)|
| 2:32:58| investing in what we call professional learning communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9178)|
| 2:33:01| which is where teachers work together to improve and hone their craft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9181)|
| 2:33:05| and simply get better at their instructional work that they do by collaborating together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9185)|
| 2:33:11| Our Excellence Through Literacy program continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9191)|
| 2:33:14| We want to focus on making sure that all students are proficient readers by third grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9194)|
| 2:33:19| and continue to be proficient and at grade level through their entire academic career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9199)|
| 2:33:24| What we saw a few years ago, the data was pretty shocking in that we saw of our incoming ninth graders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9204)|
| 2:33:32| about 25 percent of our incoming ninth graders were at least two years behind grade level in reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9212)|
| 2:33:38| So we put together this Excellence in Literacy program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9218)|
| 2:33:43| It continues within this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9223)|
| 2:33:46| Our commitment to magnet schools and to project grad continues in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9226)|
| 2:33:50| Our commitment to early education continues in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9230)|
| 2:33:53| Our commitment to things like career and technical education continues in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9233)|
| 2:33:57| We're making some investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9237)|
| 2:33:58| We're doing some retooling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9238)|
| 2:34:00| We're reallocating some resources to where we think the highest value instructional areas are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9240)|
| 2:34:07| and so it means we're making some reductions in certain areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9247)|
| 2:34:09| but we're looking at that overall to put our resources into those areas that we think are most relevant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9249)|
| 2:34:14| and most important for our future of our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9254)|
| 2:34:17| So we believe we've made some good investments in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9257)|
| 2:34:20| In summary, we believe it's a responsible budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9260)|
| 2:34:24| As Ms. Kincannon said, it is not an inflated budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9264)|
| 2:34:27| We have not come to you with a budget that's $5 million or $10 million over where we really think we need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9267)|
| 2:34:33| and pushing for that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9273)|
| 2:34:36| We think it's a very reasonable and sensible budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9276)|
| 2:34:39| We've done a lot of hard work up front to make sure that we have balanced this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9279)|
| 2:34:43| and I'll tell you, there's a good bit of pain in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9283)|
| 2:34:47| There are position reductions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9287)|
| 2:34:49| There are contract length reductions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9289)|
| 2:34:52| As I mentioned, there are cuts to all sorts of non-salary line items within this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9292)|
| 2:34:58| but all of which we think is reasonable and appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9298)|
| 2:35:01| and can support providing an outstanding education to our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9301)|
| 2:35:07| So we think it is a budget that is sensible and supportable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9307)|
| 2:35:13| and we think it's the first step toward the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9313)|
| 2:35:16| and the first step toward realizing our vision for the future of the Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9316)|
| 2:35:21| which is excellence for all students and all children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9321)|
| 2:35:26| Mr. Chairman, I'd be glad to take any questions that the commission may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9326)|
| 2:35:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9329)|
| 2:35:31| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9331)|
| 2:35:33| Dr. McIntyre, what concerns me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9333)|
| 2:35:35| I think the budget is flat, like you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9335)|
| 2:35:38| but when we're legally bound next year to approve your budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9338)|
| 2:35:41| is that just the local funding level or do we have to replace what the feds do not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9341)|
| 2:35:47| If they pull back the funding, they say they're going to give us for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9347)|
| 2:35:52| If they pull that back, do we locally have to fund that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9352)|
| 2:35:54| or is it just the local funding by law can't change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9354)|
| 2:35:57| My understanding is that the local funding can't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9357)|
| 2:36:00| The stimulus dollars are, by design, short-term dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9360)|
| 2:36:04| They're what the state has called two-time dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9364)|
| 2:36:06| They're dollars that we're going to have for two fiscal years, essentially, 27 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9366)|
| 2:36:11| We understand that those dollars are likely to go away after that time frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9371)|
| 2:36:16| and so we have put together plans, and those dollars come to us in two sleeves, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9376)|
| 2:36:23| One is IDEA, which is the dollars that are used to support the education of students in special education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9383)|
| 2:36:30| and the other is Title I, which is specifically meant to support schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9390)|
| 2:36:34| with high concentrations of kids in poverty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9394)|
| 2:36:37| So we understand that those dollars are likely to go away in two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9397)|
| 2:36:41| and so we've tried to structure those investments in ways that will have a high impact in the short term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9401)|
| 2:36:48| but more importantly, will help build our capacity over the long term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9408)|
| 2:36:52| to make sure that we can provide great instruction to our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9412)|
| 2:36:55| So, for example, one of the things that we're planning on doing on the IDEA side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9415)|
| 2:37:01| is doing lots of professional development with both our special education teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9421)|
| 2:37:05| and our regular education teachers around including kids with disabilities in the regular education setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9425)|
| 2:37:12| We do some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9432)|
| 2:37:13| We want to do more of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9433)|
| 2:37:14| We think that's educationally appropriate and helps both the kids with the disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9434)|
| 2:37:19| and the kids without disabilities to do better academically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9439)|
| 2:37:22| So we're focusing on that, and those are the types of investments that we're going to try to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9442)|
| 2:37:26| On the Title I side, we're looking at expanding the number of Title I schools that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9446)|
| 2:37:31| We have the statutory authority to expand the number of Title I school-wide schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9451)|
| 2:37:39| school-wide programs to any school that's at 40% free and reduced lunch or higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9459)|
| 2:37:45| and our current lowest percentage in the current schools that we serve is about 66%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9465)|
| 2:37:51| So we're going to add about 25 more schools in Title I for this two-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9471)|
| 2:37:56| and that provides them access to these resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9476)|
| 2:37:58| We're going to work with the schools to best invest those resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9478)|
| 2:38:03| Part of the plan is to invest in teacher leadership positions, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9483)|
| 2:38:11| positions of what we call instructional coaches that will help improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9491)|
| 2:38:16| and enhance the ability of our teachers to provide great instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9496)|
| 2:38:20| And what it does is two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9500)|
| 2:38:21| One, it builds the capacity of our teachers to do a better job and to work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9501)|
| 2:38:26| to simply become better teachers and to improve their instructional strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9506)|
| 2:38:30| and their instructional performance and help kids learn better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9510)|
| 2:38:33| But two, after that two years, those folks who have been in these leadership positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9513)|
| 2:38:37| and providing outstanding professional development for the teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9517)|
| 2:38:41| they go back to their schools and back to their regular teaching positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9521)|
| 2:38:44| as incredible resources to those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9524)|
| 2:38:48| And our hope is that that teacher leadership will continue over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9528)|
| 2:38:52| So we feel like we're investing in building our capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9532)|
| 2:38:56| not just for this two-year period but for the future as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9536)|
| 2:39:00| In two years, what you're saying, those additional schools you want to make Title I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9540)|
| 2:39:07| they're going to lose their funding in two years, and what if they're working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9547)|
| 2:39:11| What I'm concerned about is this is $16 million, and next year, in two years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9551)|
| 2:39:21| you're going to say, well, this is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9561)|
| 2:39:22| We'd like to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9562)|
| 2:39:25| That's what we're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9565)|
| 2:39:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9567)|
| 2:39:28| Are you going to take the Title I away from those schools after two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9568)|
| 2:39:31| Our perspective up front is that these are dollars that are available for two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9571)|
| 2:39:37| and so we're going to invest them wisely and make the most of them for the time that we have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9577)|
| 2:39:42| Otherwise, these folks wouldn't have access to these resources at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9582)|
| 2:39:45| if we weren't going to make them Title I schools for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9585)|
| 2:39:49| If we do find that this is an appropriate strategy to really enhance the education of our kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9589)|
| 2:39:56| in the Knox County schools, we may come back and say, we have data that says this works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9596)|
| 2:40:01| and so, yeah, we'd like you to fund more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9601)|
| 2:40:03| If we have the data to back it up that says this strategy works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9603)|
| 2:40:07| and it helps our kids learn better and achieve more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9607)|
| 2:40:11| you may want to consider giving us more money for that at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9611)|
| 2:40:15| Again, we're looking at this as two-year money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9615)|
| 2:40:17| We're looking at it as a short-term investment for a long-term enhancement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9617)|
| 2:40:21| and long-term increase in student achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9621)|
| 2:40:24| The more Title I schools you have, do you get more funding from the federal government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9624)|
| 2:40:31| Because we're getting more money from the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9631)|
| 2:40:34| that allows us the opportunity to expand the number of Title I schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9634)|
| 2:40:39| without taking away from the existing Title I schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9639)|
| 2:40:42| So I don't think if we weren't getting the stimulus dollars through Title I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9642)|
| 2:40:46| I'm not sure we'd be talking about expanding much further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9646)|
| 2:40:48| because that would mean spreading the same number of dollars over more schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9648)|
| 2:40:53| and you might be watering down the effect that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9653)|
| 2:40:58| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9658)|
| 2:41:00| Thank you, Mr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9660)|
| 2:41:01| You talked about central office, that you made some cuts there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9661)|
| 2:41:03| Can you give us some highlights for central office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9663)|
| 2:41:05| I've got three questions I want to ask you, but that's the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9665)|
| 2:41:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9668)|
| 2:41:10| We made some – let me just – I guess probably the best way to put it is to look at it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9670)|
| 2:41:16| When we looked at our administrative and operational budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9676)|
| 2:41:20| we're taking between a 5% and 10% reduction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9680)|
| 2:41:23| 10% in many of our central office departments that are administrative offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9683)|
| 2:41:28| When we look at our instructional budget, which includes teachers and school budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9688)|
| 2:41:33| we're looking at about a little over – between 1% and 1.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9693)|
| 2:41:38| So we've really focused our cost cutting and our budget cutting on administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9698)|
| 2:41:43| and operational areas more so than on schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9703)|
| 2:41:46| That's probably the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9706)|
| 2:41:47| But it's everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9707)|
| 2:41:49| It's supplies and materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9709)|
| 2:41:50| It's contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9710)|
| 2:41:52| It's positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9712)|
| 2:41:55| It's supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9715)|
| 2:41:56| It's secretaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9716)|
| 2:41:57| It's really – we've really taken a real deep and hard look at our central office to see what we can –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9717)|
| 2:42:06| because every dollar we cut there is a dollar we didn't have to cut in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9726)|
| 2:42:09| And so we're trying to protect the classrooms as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9729)|
| 2:42:13| I asked you in the finance meeting, you were going to get me a list of the vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9733)|
| 2:42:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9736)|
| 2:42:17| We actually transmitted that to the chair, but I know he's out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9737)|
| 2:42:19| so I don't know how that works in his absence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9739)|
| 2:42:23| Do you have a – do you know how many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9743)|
| 2:42:25| Yeah, we have – my understanding is we have eight take-home vehicles in Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9745)|
| 2:42:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9748)|
| 2:42:29| They are – and they are supervisory positions in our security area and our maintenance area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9749)|
| 2:42:34| folks who are on call 24 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9754)|
| 2:42:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9756)|
| 2:42:37| Project graduation, how much is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9757)|
| 2:42:40| How much do you put on project graduation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9760)|
| 2:42:42| What's in your budget for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9762)|
| 2:42:44| Project grad is – let me get that figure for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9764)|
| 2:42:49| 1.5 in your book here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9769)|
| 2:42:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9774)|
| 2:43:01| 1.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9781)|
| 2:43:02| About 1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9782)|
| 2:43:03| And if you do not get that, that don't participate in that, what percentage of schools don't participate in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9783)|
| 2:43:10| Project grad is a specific program that is targeted toward the empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9790)|
| 2:43:16| So it's only – it is 14 schools that are involved with project grad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9796)|
| 2:43:21| I think it's a – it's our schools that are largely schools that are high numbers of students in poverty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9801)|
| 2:43:29| and oftentimes high-need schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9809)|
| 2:43:32| So it's a specific urban school, I suppose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9812)|
| 2:43:35| or high-need school reform effort that's targeted toward schools that have pretty substantial needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9815)|
| 2:43:43| It has both a – it's sort of an academic framework but more so a support framework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9823)|
| 2:43:51| making sure that students have – and parents are part of the educational process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9831)|
| 2:43:56| making sure that services are brokered to students who need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9836)|
| 2:44:00| It has a very specific and clear college-going component to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9840)|
| 2:44:05| that encourages students to be looking at college and where they're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9845)|
| 2:44:09| It has some academic components to it, like it has a math component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9849)|
| 2:44:12| that enhances the current Knox County Schools math component, math curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9852)|
| 2:44:17| So – and when we look at the data, and we did look at the data, there is – I think there are some –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9857)|
| 2:44:23| there are different ways of looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9863)|
| 2:44:25| There are some mixed results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9865)|
| 2:44:27| There are some data points where you say, hmm, looks like we could do better there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9867)|
| 2:44:32| And we've been using that data to make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9872)|
| 2:44:35| For example, what we saw about a year and a half ago was that in English Language Arts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9875)|
| 2:44:41| Project RAD wasn't doing as well as we thought it could or should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9881)|
| 2:44:45| And so we moved from the Project RAD curriculum that was in place, which is success for all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9885)|
| 2:44:53| moved away from that into the district English Language Arts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9893)|
| 2:44:56| and Reading curriculum for our Project RAD school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9896)|
| 2:44:59| So we're making decisions based on the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9899)|
| 2:45:01| But when I look at the data, I think there is some real promise in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9901)|
| 2:45:04| as to what this urban school reform framework and structure can do for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9904)|
| 2:45:10| So I think it's a worthy investment and one that we should continue to monitor closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9910)|
| 2:45:16| and take a look at the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9916)|
| 2:45:18| But I think the outcomes justify continuing that program and that investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9918)|
| 2:45:24| We've got the list of vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9924)|
| 2:45:25| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9925)|
| 2:45:26| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9926)|
| 2:45:38| Are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9938)|
| 2:45:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9939)|
| 2:45:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9940)|
| 2:45:41| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9941)|
| 2:45:43| I thought you said you had three questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9943)|
| 2:45:45| I had three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9945)|
| 2:45:46| You weren't listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9946)|
| 2:45:47| One just went right past me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9947)|
| 2:45:51| Superintendent, I'd like to thank you for what you've done in your short amount of time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9951)|
| 2:45:58| I'd like to address a few things just to kind of get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9958)|
| 2:46:02| And Project RAD, I encourage every commissioner to see what Project RAD is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9962)|
| 2:46:08| And I challenge Commissioner Smith and some of the other commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9968)|
| 2:46:14| in other districts to trade or principals to trade a lower student-teacher ratio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9974)|
| 2:46:21| and give them a Project RAD funding and opportunities and do a trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9981)|
| 2:46:27| I mean, it takes a lot when you're dealing with poverty and some of our urban schools deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9987)|
| 2:46:36| So Project RAD works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9996)|
| 2:46:38| And I'd also like to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=9998)|
| 2:46:40| You and I have had a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10000)|
| 2:46:41| Thank you for not just taking the Project RAD model and rolling it out for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10001)|
| 2:46:46| I mean, the English model may have worked in Houston, Texas, but it didn't work here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10006)|
| 2:46:53| So I applaud you and your staff for recognizing that and making that change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10013)|
| 2:46:57| and not continuing to fund a program that's less than admirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10017)|
| 2:47:04| Question about Recovery Act stimulus dollar money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10024)|
| 2:47:10| What was the process that you all used to go out there and figure out how much was applicable to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10030)|
| 2:47:22| I guess the bottom line question is, are there additional dollars out there that because we didn't have the right person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10042)|
| 2:47:28| or the right lobbyist or the right education person that we weren't able to capture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10048)|
| 2:47:36| I would say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10056)|
| 2:47:37| We are given an allocation of dollars, and, again, there are those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10057)|
| 2:47:42| The way that the economic stimulus dollars came to public education under the American Reinvestment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10062)|
| 2:47:48| and Recovery Act was through those two particular federal grant programs, IDEA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10068)|
| 2:47:54| which is a special education grant, and Title I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10074)|
| 2:47:57| which is a grant targeted toward schools serving high concentrations of kids in poverty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10077)|
| 2:48:03| So there are specific formulas that dictate how those allocations are typically made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10083)|
| 2:48:10| And so those dollars came to us from the federal government through the state via a specific formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10090)|
| 2:48:16| Now, there was talk at the beginning of all this economic stimulus package of there being some school construction money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10096)|
| 2:48:23| and that did not come to bear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10103)|
| 2:48:25| So, you know, could public education across the nation have done better with lobbying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10105)|
| 2:48:30| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10110)|
| 2:48:31| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10111)|
| 2:48:32| Might we have gotten some of those dollars at some point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10112)|
| 2:48:34| Perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10114)|
| 2:48:35| But the way that that played out was there's a local stabilization fund at the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10115)|
| 2:48:40| and that's part of how some dollars were meant to come to localities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10120)|
| 2:48:46| And some of those dollars, I'm told, could be or may be used for school construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10126)|
| 2:48:51| but that's not the plan as I understand it in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10131)|
| 2:48:54| So, you know, could there have been a school construction component if things had gone differently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10134)|
| 2:48:59| Perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10139)|
| 2:49:00| But, you know, we deal with what we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10140)|
| 2:49:02| And there are still some dollars that are discretionary to the Commissioner of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10142)|
| 2:49:08| There's something called the Race to the Top Fund that will be distributed for public education across the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10148)|
| 2:49:15| What I understand is that those will be competitive grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10155)|
| 2:49:18| and that they'll largely probably be given to either regions or states or systems of schools working together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10158)|
| 2:49:26| rather than single LEAs, local education agencies or authorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10166)|
| 2:49:31| So I think there's still some additional dollars that will be competitive grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10171)|
| 2:49:35| and certainly if we think there are dollars that make sense for us to go after, we're going to continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10175)|
| 2:49:42| One of the nice things is when we look at our vision for the future of the Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10182)|
| 2:49:47| and what we'd like to do here and where we'd like to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10187)|
| 2:49:50| and we look at some of the things that are being proffered on the national stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10190)|
| 2:49:54| particularly from the Secretary of Education and even the President,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10194)|
| 2:49:56| there's actually great alignment there between what we'd like to do in terms of teacher quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10196)|
| 2:50:01| in terms of incentives, in terms of professional learning communities and teacher collaboration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10201)|
| 2:50:06| and accountability and data systems that we're talking about here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10206)|
| 2:50:12| and what they're talking about at the Department of Education and that the President is often referring to in his speeches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10212)|
| 2:50:17| So there's some great synergy there, and I hope that if and when those dollars become available for competitive grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10217)|
| 2:50:22| that we'll go after some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10222)|
| 2:50:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10224)|
| 2:50:26| Question on Title I funds and how they're used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10226)|
| 2:50:31| How much discretion does a school principal have in how he or she is going to allocate those funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10231)|
| 2:50:38| It sounds like you're giving some guidance on teacher leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10238)|
| 2:50:41| but is there any discretion that they or any funding that they can kind of bring that's suitable to their school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10241)|
| 2:50:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10252)|
| 2:50:53| Part of my philosophy in terms of principal leadership is for us to make sure that we have great leadership at the helm of every school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10253)|
| 2:51:01| and then look to them for recommendations and guidance about what they think works best for their school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10261)|
| 2:51:08| and their school community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10268)|
| 2:51:10| There are certain things that will be non-negotiable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10270)|
| 2:51:12| There are certain parameters within which they'll have to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10272)|
| 2:51:14| But I like to say to schools, you know, here's some direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10274)|
| 2:51:18| but also here's some resources that why don't you tell me how you recommend using those dollars to best benefit the students in your school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10278)|
| 2:51:26| to best increase student achievement in your school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10286)|
| 2:51:29| And so there's a little bit of a balance there to say we want to use some of these resources for specific types of opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10289)|
| 2:51:37| specific types of teacher leadership opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10297)|
| 2:51:40| One of the areas that we want to encourage the schools that are going to be new Title I schools to look at is investments in technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10300)|
| 2:51:46| because this is, for them, probably a once-in-a-decade or once-in-a-generation type of opportunity in terms of the resources that are available to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10306)|
| 2:51:55| And so we want them to make sure that they use it wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10315)|
| 2:51:57| So we'll be looking for recommendations from the school principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10317)|
| 2:52:00| and from the school communities about how to use some of these resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10320)|
| 2:52:03| But there will also be some guidance and direction on some of it to say this is some of the priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10323)|
| 2:52:08| One of the key strategies for enhancing instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10328)|
| 2:52:15| and therefore increasing student achievement for the Knox County Schools is what we call professional learning communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10335)|
| 2:52:21| It's teachers working together to hone their craft, to improve their craft, to get better together as teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10341)|
| 2:52:28| to learn from each other as teachers, and to make sure that as they think about their students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10348)|
| 2:52:34| as they talk about student data, as they visit each other's classrooms and model lessons for each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10354)|
| 2:52:40| that they leverage the expertise that's right there in their school building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10360)|
| 2:52:43| So that's going to be an important part of any strategy that we think about for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10363)|
| 2:52:47| But certainly we will rely on our school principals to give us recommendation about how some of these resources they think will best be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10367)|
| 2:52:55| And my last question or comment is I definitely applaud what you all are doing with the career technical component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10375)|
| 2:53:04| Work a lot, labor relations at Oak Ridge National Lab and machinists, mailwrights, carpenters, electricians are vitally needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10384)|
| 2:53:15| because there's no real apprenticeship program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10395)|
| 2:53:18| We kind of need to have those skills walking in the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10398)|
| 2:53:21| So that is an admirable thing that you all are starting to put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10401)|
| 2:53:26| And in terms of funding, is that piece, that funding, that's not funding that will go away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10406)|
| 2:53:35| That's in the budget and will continue on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10415)|
| 2:53:38| There's two components to the funding there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10418)|
| 2:53:40| One is the general fund dollars that we commit largely to teachers and some equipment and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10420)|
| 2:53:44| And then there's the Carl Perkins Federal Grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10424)|
| 2:53:46| which is a substantial component of how we fund some of the investments in career and technical education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10426)|
| 2:53:53| What I've asked Mr. Don Lawson and Dr. Donna Wright to do is to really think about what the direction for the next four or five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10433)|
| 2:54:02| in career and technical education should be and needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10442)|
| 2:54:05| And let's put together a plan and really think about how we fund that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10445)|
| 2:54:08| I was at the North Knox Vocational Center yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10448)|
| 2:54:12| It was my 86th school visit out of 86.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10452)|
| 2:54:15| So I've now visited all of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10455)|
| 2:54:17| And we have in the machine shop there, we have equipment that is still serviceable and still works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10457)|
| 2:54:25| and still follows the basic premise of what's out in the industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10465)|
| 2:54:30| But they're literally from the 1950s, these pieces of machinery and equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10470)|
| 2:54:35| And we really need to think about how we invest in the future for some of our machine shops and other of our CTE areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10475)|
| 2:54:44| A lot of that now is computer-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10484)|
| 2:54:46| A lot of it is much more technology that's out there in industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10486)|
| 2:54:50| And how do we make sure that we are preparing our students for that new world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10490)|
| 2:54:54| and to make sure that we are looking at the demand, we're looking at what's relevant for our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10494)|
| 2:55:00| and making sure that we create and sustain programs that really speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10500)|
| 2:55:04| Now, on the other side of the coin, that's going to mean deleting some programs from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10504)|
| 2:55:08| It's going to mean retooling some programs from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10508)|
| 2:55:10| And that's painful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10510)|
| 2:55:11| And we felt that this year as we sought to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10511)|
| 2:55:14| But I believe it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10514)|
| 2:55:16| And we need to continue to focus on where's our future for career and technical education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10516)|
| 2:55:22| Are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10522)|
| 2:55:24| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10524)|
| 2:55:25| Yes, I just have three questions to ask you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10525)|
| 2:55:28| What is the school's fund balance right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10528)|
| 2:55:32| The school's fund balance, we have a required fund balance from the state of three percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10532)|
| 2:55:38| And we're a little bit over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10538)|
| 2:55:41| And I'm going to ask Mr. Thomas and Mr. McPherson, who are our finance folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10541)|
| 2:55:44| to give you more specific numbers about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10544)|
| 2:55:50| Bob Thomas, 5325 Beverly Oaks Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10550)|
| 2:55:54| Commissioner, in terms of the three percent that's required by the state, that's a little over $11 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10554)|
| 2:56:00| So that's part of the reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10560)|
| 2:56:02| And in addition to that, probably at $2.5 million above that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10562)|
| 2:56:06| That's not total fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10566)|
| 2:56:08| That's leaving out designations and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10568)|
| 2:56:10| But if you just wanted to look at what's available, the three percent, which would be a little over $11 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10570)|
| 2:56:15| And then, in addition to that, at $2.5 million if the budget that's been recommended is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10575)|
| 2:56:22| And that's the total in your fund balances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10582)|
| 2:56:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10584)|
| 2:56:26| What is the school's debt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10586)|
| 2:56:29| The school's debt, I think, Mr. McPherson, is about $360 million total, I think, principal and interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10589)|
| 2:56:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10599)|
| 2:56:40| Are you required by the state to maintain a certain percentage of fund balance tied in with your debt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10600)|
| 2:56:45| Not with the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10605)|
| 2:56:47| I think the three percent is just on the operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10607)|
| 2:56:50| On your operating budget, three percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10610)|
| 2:56:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10612)|
| 2:56:56| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10616)|
| 2:56:59| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10619)|
| 2:57:00| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10620)|
| 2:57:01| I have some concerns about, and this is going to seem pretty minor compared to the overall plan for education in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10621)|
| 2:57:08| But it's come to my attention that there are a couple dozen schools that don't have hot water at their hand-washing stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10628)|
| 2:57:15| And with the flu season expected to be bad next year, I'm wondering if there are any plans to fix that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10635)|
| 2:57:24| so that all our kids have warm water to encourage them to wash their hands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10644)|
| 2:57:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10647)|
| 2:57:29| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10649)|
| 2:57:30| Let me speak a little bit to that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10650)|
| 2:57:32| Yes, we have a couple dozen schools that were essentially built not to have hot water at all of the restrooms for boys and girls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10652)|
| 2:57:41| And so we do have that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10661)|
| 2:57:43| Now, I'm not a doctor, although I've spent a lot of time with the health department lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10663)|
| 2:57:47| And I'm told that having hot water to wash your hands or having cold water to wash your hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10667)|
| 2:57:54| there's no medical difference or no health difference in terms of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10674)|
| 2:57:57| but that there is potentially a difference in the likelihood that a student or a person will want to wash their hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10677)|
| 2:58:04| if there's cold water versus warm water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10684)|
| 2:58:06| So we understand that, and we get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10686)|
| 2:58:09| What we've done is we've talked with Dr. Buchanan and Mr. Jones at the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10689)|
| 2:58:14| We're going to develop probably about a five-year plan to think about what that might look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10694)|
| 2:58:19| what it might cost to implement hot water at all of our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10699)|
| 2:58:23| and what it would take to do that and what the cost might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10703)|
| 2:58:27| So we're going to take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10707)|
| 2:58:30| And it may be substantial because of the way that the schools were designed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10710)|
| 2:58:35| because of the way that they were built, it may be a fairly substantial cost to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10715)|
| 2:58:39| But we've committed to doing the analysis to see what it would take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10719)|
| 2:58:44| and potentially putting together about a five-year plan to see if we can address that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10724)|
| 2:58:53| Five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10733)|
| 2:58:54| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10734)|
| 2:58:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10735)|
| 2:58:56| I would like to see it move a little more quickly than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10736)|
| 2:58:59| I understand, too, that teachers use the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10739)|
| 2:59:02| every year the teacher sends home a list of things that she would like families to send into the classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10742)|
| 2:59:06| and at the top of the list every year is hand sanitizer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10746)|
| 2:59:09| So families always donate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10749)|
| 2:59:11| We hope that they encourage the kids to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10751)|
| 2:59:13| But, you know, kids always have cuts and scrapes, and that stuff burns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10753)|
| 2:59:17| And I know at hospitals, Dr. Briggs and I were talking about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10757)|
| 2:59:20| they have the wall-mounted dispensers that before you go into a room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10760)|
| 2:59:25| you punch the button and get hand sanitizer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10765)|
| 2:59:27| Is there any way that we could implement something like that to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10767)|
| 2:59:32| I'm just very concerned about kids and germs and flus this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10772)|
| 2:59:37| And as someone with an elementary school children and a troop full of Branny Scouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10777)|
| 2:59:43| I know how hard it can be to get kids to wash their hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10783)|
| 2:59:46| Well, you're right that many of our teachers do ask for hand sanitizer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10786)|
| 2:59:50| and many of them have it in their classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10790)|
| 2:59:52| We've actually made, at the recommendation of the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10792)|
| 2:59:55| we have made a major investment in hand sanitizer this spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10795)|
| 2:59:59| We think that will last us actually for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10799)|
| 3:00:02| But we do believe the combination of that hand sanitizer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10802)|
| 3:00:06| plus encouraging kids to wash their hands, will help a good bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10806)|
| 3:00:11| And that's what the health department recommends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10811)|
| 3:00:14| That's what they want to see us do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10814)|
| 3:00:17| They do want to see us address the hot water issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10817)|
| 3:00:19| but they are willing to work with us to develop a plan over time to make that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10819)|
| 3:00:24| recognizing that some of the schools were built many decades ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10824)|
| 3:00:28| and if we can address that issue over a period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10828)|
| 3:00:33| that is both conscious of that issue, but also fiscally responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10833)|
| 3:00:38| They've indicated that they would be pleased with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10838)|
| 3:00:43| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10843)|
| 3:00:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10844)|
| 3:00:45| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10845)|
| 3:00:47| Thank you for all you do, and thank Indy and Karen for the good work she does, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10847)|
| 3:00:53| Project GRAD, you said there's an expanded commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10853)|
| 3:00:57| Does that expanded commitment include a greater amount of dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10857)|
| 3:00:59| What are we talking about in terms of increased dollars for Project GRAD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10859)|
| 3:01:02| There's actually not an expanded commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10862)|
| 3:01:03| There's a continued commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10863)|
| 3:01:05| And there's actually a decrease in the Project GRAD budget this year of actually a couple hundred thousand dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10865)|
| 3:01:11| But that's more of, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10871)|
| 3:01:14| an issue of sort of how we've paid the bills in that contractual relationship more than anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10874)|
| 3:01:20| So I don't see a decrease in service for Project GRAD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10880)|
| 3:01:23| but it's actually a decrease in the budgeted dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10883)|
| 3:01:26| But the commitment continues in terms of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10886)|
| 3:01:28| So the decrease of $200,000, does your figure of $200,000 include the $82,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10888)|
| 3:01:34| that is no longer in the community services portion of the mayor's budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10894)|
| 3:01:38| Because there's a Project GRAD line in the mayor's budget that used to be there, used to have $82,000, and now has zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10898)|
| 3:01:45| Well, Project GRAD, the funding for Project GRAD comes from several different sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10905)|
| 3:01:50| When I'm talking about the dollars that are committed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10910)|
| 3:01:53| I'm talking about the dollars that are committed from the Knox County Schools to Project GRAD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10913)|
| 3:01:56| There's also a commitment from Project GRAD Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10916)|
| 3:01:59| which is a private nonprofit entity that provides resources and commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10919)|
| 3:02:04| And there are also, as I understand it, a host of potential private donors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10924)|
| 3:02:09| and corporate donors that also invest in Project GRAD as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10929)|
| 3:02:15| So when I talk about our portion of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10935)|
| 3:02:18| I'm really talking about what the Knox County Schools commits to that program and to that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10938)|
| 3:02:23| I would suspect that the mayor's portion was going to Project GRAD Knoxville, but I don't know that for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10943)|
| 3:02:28| Probably, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10948)|
| 3:02:29| If it's in community services, it's probably going to the, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10949)|
| 3:02:32| So that's actually $280,000 down, and that concerns me a little bit about Project GRAD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10952)|
| 3:02:38| The other thing I'm concerned about, and again, involves private sector, is the Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10958)|
| 3:02:43| We had some chat in the morning session about the $3.8 million there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10963)|
| 3:02:47| Would it make sense to, say, ask the private sector to stand up a little bit more on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10967)|
| 3:02:54| trim maybe a million dollars out of that, expand your guys' budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10974)|
| 3:02:59| and maybe you can save some of those 35 teaching jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10979)|
| 3:03:02| Well, I think it's important not to really separate too much the Great Schools Partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10982)|
| 3:03:09| from the work that the Knox County Schools does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10989)|
| 3:03:11| The Great Schools Partnership budget is not only appropriated by or largely appropriated by you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10991)|
| 3:03:17| it's also approved by the Knox County Schools Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10997)|
| 3:03:20| and the initiatives that are undertaken are largely at the behest and in the interest of the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11000)|
| 3:03:29| I think the Great Schools Partnership has been enormously successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11009)|
| 3:03:33| in helping the Knox County Schools to do innovative things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11013)|
| 3:03:37| Some of the most successful things that we've done in the last four or five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11017)|
| 3:03:40| have been in partnership with the Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11020)|
| 3:03:43| Some of the early education initiatives that we've put in place, like the Kindergarten Intervention Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11023)|
| 3:03:47| which allows for small groups of kindergarten kids who may be struggling or at risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11027)|
| 3:03:53| to get targeted attention from their teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11033)|
| 3:03:56| The TAP Program, the Teacher Advancement Program, which has seen great success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11036)|
| 3:04:01| Senator Frist was here with the mayor the other day at Holston Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11041)|
| 3:04:07| and just saw the amazing results that they're getting there from Teacher Advancement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11047)|
| 3:04:12| So some of those early education programs and other really innovative initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11052)|
| 3:04:18| have come to fruition in partnership with the Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11058)|
| 3:04:22| So I think it's a worthy investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11062)|
| 3:04:24| Now what we have talked about, and I think we are probably in a position to do this coming fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11064)|
| 3:04:29| is to say, okay, the purpose of the Great Schools Partnership is to help start some of these innovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11069)|
| 3:04:35| It's to help put in place some of these innovations and get them going and get them off the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11075)|
| 3:04:39| And now that some of them have become mature, let's transfer some of those dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11079)|
| 3:04:44| from the Great Schools Partnership to the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11084)|
| 3:04:48| And I think over the next 12 months, you'll see specific conversation about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11088)|
| 3:04:52| with the Great Schools Partnership and the Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11092)|
| 3:04:55| probably specifically around kindergarten intervention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11095)|
| 3:04:57| because it is a fairly mature program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11097)|
| 3:04:59| I think that's important for us programmatically, for us to own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11099)|
| 3:05:04| But I think it's also important as we think about the future of the Great Schools Partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11104)|
| 3:05:08| and as we think about the fact that at some point we'd probably like to see the Great Schools Partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11108)|
| 3:05:12| go out and beat the bushes for private dollars and foundation dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11112)|
| 3:05:16| and not only be funded through public dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11116)|
| 3:05:20| And I think for the Great Schools Partnership to have a record of success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11120)|
| 3:05:25| in developing innovative programs with the Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11125)|
| 3:05:28| and then transferring ownership of those programs and the resources to the Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11128)|
| 3:05:32| will be vital in our ability to attract private dollars and foundation dollars for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11132)|
| 3:05:38| I want to encourage you along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11138)|
| 3:05:40| That's exactly what I was hoping for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11140)|
| 3:05:44| Commissioner Tony Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11144)|
| 3:05:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11147)|
| 3:05:50| Dr. McIntyre, I want to echo the praise of several of our colleagues here for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11150)|
| 3:05:57| and for Ms. Kincannon and the atmosphere that you all helped create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11157)|
| 3:06:02| You know our history a little bit between the commission and the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11162)|
| 3:06:07| And so I think you all definitely are doing a very nice job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11167)|
| 3:06:13| And the real test of that, of course, is the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11173)|
| 3:06:18| That's when things do start to get a little strained, and so we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11178)|
| 3:06:25| I did have a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11185)|
| 3:06:27| One, if we said Title I schools, how many Title I schools would we have in the system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11187)|
| 3:06:34| Or are they partially Title I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11194)|
| 3:06:39| I don't know how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11199)|
| 3:06:41| We have only what are called Title I school-wide programs right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11201)|
| 3:06:45| That is any school that has 40 percent of their students living in poverty or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11205)|
| 3:06:52| is eligible to be a Title I school-wide school, but the individual school district makes that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11212)|
| 3:06:58| So we have 21 schools currently that are Title I schools, and those resources can be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11218)|
| 3:07:04| At a point in time when Title I began, it began as a reading program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11224)|
| 3:07:07| and it began as a pull-out reading program for poor kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11227)|
| 3:07:10| And only kids who are low-income kids could benefit from those dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11230)|
| 3:07:14| So what you had was a model where you'd have four or five kids get pulled out of the regular classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11234)|
| 3:07:20| to work with a teacher in smaller groups, but it was only low-income kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11240)|
| 3:07:25| and it was only for that specific model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11245)|
| 3:07:28| Over time, what the federal government has recognized is that when you have a high concentration of kids in poverty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11248)|
| 3:07:33| you have needs across that entire school and not just for those poor kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11253)|
| 3:07:37| So they've designated this school-wide model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11257)|
| 3:07:41| which means any school that has 40 percent or more kids in poverty may be eligible to be a school-wide program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11261)|
| 3:07:48| and therefore you can use the Title I dollars that you receive for school improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11268)|
| 3:07:52| and for all kids in that particular school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11272)|
| 3:07:55| Now, we currently have 21 Title I schools, and the lowest percent of poverty, as I understand it, is about 65 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11275)|
| 3:08:02| We can go down to the 40 percent threshold, given that we have additional dollars coming through the stimulus funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11282)|
| 3:08:08| and when we do that, it increases the number to about 46 programs, school-wide schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11288)|
| 3:08:15| So we would bring it right down to that 40 percent threshold, and it would increase by, I think, 25 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11295)|
| 3:08:22| How many of those schools are high schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11302)|
| 3:08:25| Do you gentlemen have the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11305)|
| 3:08:34| Commissioner, it looks like four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11314)|
| 3:08:37| What are those high schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11317)|
| 3:08:40| South Doyle High School, Central High School, Carter High School, and West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11320)|
| 3:08:50| You mentioned earlier, and Commissioner Smith added reference to the cuts you've made in central office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11330)|
| 3:08:58| and you referred to positional cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11338)|
| 3:09:04| Can you talk about some of those cuts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11344)|
| 3:09:09| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11349)|
| 3:09:12| Some of those cuts are secretarial clerical positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11352)|
| 3:09:15| We have made some reductions in a couple of technology positions that were vacant and somewhat hard to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11355)|
| 3:09:24| Four positions in supervisory areas, one of which is mathematics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11364)|
| 3:09:29| and the structure that we have for mathematics is we have a math supervisor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11369)|
| 3:09:32| and then two math specialists that work under that supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11372)|
| 3:09:36| One of them is secondary and one is elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11376)|
| 3:09:38| and what we've chosen to do is for at least this coming fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11378)|
| 3:09:41| given the budget constraints, is to not fill that position that's coming vacant in mathematics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11381)|
| 3:09:46| So we've really looked under every rock within the central office to see where we could make reductions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11386)|
| 3:09:54| to see where we could make reallocations to higher priority areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11394)|
| 3:09:57| to try to mitigate as much as we possibly could the negative impact of some of the reductions that we've been forced to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11397)|
| 3:10:07| I guess my last question, and I'm sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday on the phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11407)|
| 3:10:15| The mayor had supplied us with positions, salary statements, and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11415)|
| 3:10:24| and I just thought that would be a good thing in the air of transparency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11424)|
| 3:10:28| especially for the central office staff, to just give us by position, base salaries, total compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11428)|
| 3:10:34| that kind of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11434)|
| 3:10:36| Would you all be willing to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11436)|
| 3:10:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11438)|
| 3:10:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11439)|
| 3:10:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11440)|
| 3:10:41| So how long a period would that take us to generate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11441)|
| 3:10:47| Probably five or six business days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11447)|
| 3:10:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11449)|
| 3:10:50| That would be super.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11450)|
| 3:10:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11451)|
| 3:10:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11452)|
| 3:10:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11453)|
| 3:10:55| Dr. McIntyre, I want to build on Commissioner Anders' question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11455)|
| 3:10:59| which was around the increasing of the maintenance of effort due to the stimulus money, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11459)|
| 3:11:08| What my question is about, though, is from last year's or this current budget to the proposed budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11468)|
| 3:11:14| then what do you estimate the maintenance of effort level to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11474)|
| 3:11:22| Well, my understanding, and as you know, Commissioner, and as all of you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11482)|
| 3:11:27| there is some substantial question about what maintenance of effort precisely means in the state of Tennessee right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11487)|
| 3:11:33| My understanding of it is that, and the way it has been interpreted, as I understand it, in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11493)|
| 3:11:39| is that local school districts, barring a reduction in enrollment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11499)|
| 3:11:44| would not see a decrease in the appropriation that that school district sees on the general fund from one year to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11504)|
| 3:11:52| So I would anticipate the maintenance of effort would be in the $375 million range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11512)|
| 3:12:00| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11520)|
| 3:12:01| What I was asking, what's the increase from this current year to next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11521)|
| 3:12:06| Well, I think it really does depend on how you look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11526)|
| 3:12:10| As I mentioned at the outset, our appropriation for the current year is $370 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11530)|
| 3:12:16| but we received additional revenue from the state of Tennessee through the BEP formula of about $4.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11536)|
| 3:12:23| So in terms of the real dollar increase, it's minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11543)|
| 3:12:28| It's largely level funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11548)|
| 3:12:34| A technical question, and you gave a technical answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11554)|
| 3:12:39| I appreciate that because it makes it easier to discuss the budget if the budget is staying at the maintenance level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11559)|
| 3:12:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11568)|
| 3:12:49| And I'm aware of efforts at the state level to further clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11569)|
| 3:12:52| and define what maintenance of effort means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11572)|
| 3:12:56| but I don't know if those will move forward or not in this legislative session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11576)|
| 3:13:03| Are you done, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11583)|
| 3:13:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11586)|
| 3:13:07| Commissioner Pinkston, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11587)|
| 3:13:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11590)|
| 3:13:11| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11591)|
| 3:13:14| In your opinion, where do you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11594)|
| 3:13:16| and when do you see Adrian Burnett coming on to get a new school, Adrian Burnett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11596)|
| 3:13:20| When do I see it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11600)|
| 3:13:21| Say it again, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11601)|
| 3:13:22| When do you see architectural plans start to come up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11602)|
| 3:13:25| When do you see, what are your plans for Adrian Burnett in the next three, five, ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11605)|
| 3:13:31| When are we going to get a new school at Adrian Burnett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11611)|
| 3:13:33| We have no current plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11613)|
| 3:13:36| We define the capital priorities in this capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11616)|
| 3:13:40| and it was essentially we took a little bit of a different approach this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11620)|
| 3:13:46| We said here are some of the needs in terms of physical plan upgrades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11626)|
| 3:13:51| Here are some of the needs in terms of roofs and HVAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11631)|
| 3:13:54| Here are some of the needs in terms of shoring up foundations and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11634)|
| 3:13:58| And then here are five priority projects for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11638)|
| 3:14:04| And we did that because at that point there was talk about the stimulus funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11644)|
| 3:14:07| We didn't know what that was going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11647)|
| 3:14:09| There was talk about a green building fund from the state, which is coming to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11649)|
| 3:14:13| So the board, at my recommendation, voted on five priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11653)|
| 3:14:19| one of which was Chilhowee Intermediate, one of which was a Magnet Technology High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11659)|
| 3:14:25| one of which was Bell Morris, a green addition at Bell Morris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11665)|
| 3:14:29| one of which was doing some work at the Carter Middle School Gymnasium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11669)|
| 3:14:33| and doing some work at that campus to do some renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11673)|
| 3:14:36| And then the last one I mentioned, which was actually first on the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11676)|
| 3:14:41| was a solution for West Knox County Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11681)|
| 3:14:46| recognizing that our current projections see us looking at an increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11686)|
| 3:14:51| of about 500 school children in the elementary range in the next four or five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11691)|
| 3:14:56| in the southwestern part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11696)|
| 3:15:00| So Adrian Burnett is not on that priority list at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11700)|
| 3:15:04| Who gets that list for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11704)|
| 3:15:05| Is that Mr. French?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11705)|
| 3:15:06| Does he do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11706)|
| 3:15:07| Who advises you that, hey, here's our next thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11707)|
| 3:15:11| Well, it was my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11711)|
| 3:15:13| It was developed with a variety of staff advising me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11713)|
| 3:15:17| but it was my recommendation to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11717)|
| 3:15:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11719)|
| 3:15:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11720)|
| 3:15:22| Can I just mention one other thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11722)|
| 3:15:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11724)|
| 3:15:25| I did walk Adrian Burnett with a structural engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11725)|
| 3:15:31| because there was talk about Adrian Burnett being a temporary building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11731)|
| 3:15:34| and all that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11734)|
| 3:15:36| and the structural engineer said temporary is really just a label that you put on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11736)|
| 3:15:40| The code in terms of requirements for building structures is the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11740)|
| 3:15:44| and rather than a steel structure, it is a pressed timber structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11744)|
| 3:15:50| But he said with good maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11750)|
| 3:15:53| pressed timber is going to last as long as any other building material that you have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11753)|
| 3:15:58| So it's not a building that's ready to fall down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11758)|
| 3:16:00| or that we have major structural concerns about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11760)|
| 3:16:06| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11766)|
| 3:16:08| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11768)|
| 3:16:10| Dr. McIntyre, this is my first year through a county budget, as it is for my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11770)|
| 3:16:17| We've been here about eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11777)|
| 3:16:19| Mine too, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11779)|
| 3:16:20| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11780)|
| 3:16:21| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11781)|
| 3:16:22| We'll learn together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11782)|
| 3:16:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11783)|
| 3:16:25| As you recall in our probably in the newspapers and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11785)|
| 3:16:28| the general fund has taken a multi-million dollar hit for a subsidy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11788)|
| 3:16:34| a required subsidy to fund pensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11794)|
| 3:16:37| a couple million for the uniformed officers and for some other closed defined benefit plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11797)|
| 3:16:43| And, again, it's a dumb question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11803)|
| 3:16:45| I guess I only see a $650,000 line item for a closed defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11805)|
| 3:16:53| Of the thousands of retired Knox County school teachers and staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11813)|
| 3:16:57| are they funded by a state pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11817)|
| 3:17:00| and so therefore it's the state's problem to back that up, or am I missing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11820)|
| 3:17:05| I'm looking for the, I'm sure they didn't, I'm sure the pension fund that pays the teachers had a 30% or 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11825)|
| 3:17:13| Well, there's a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11833)|
| 3:17:14| It is a state teacher's pension, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11834)|
| 3:17:19| And Mr. Thomas can speak to more of the specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11839)|
| 3:17:20| We did have an increase in one of our fixed cost areas was an increase in the recommended amount that we contribute to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11840)|
| 3:17:28| CTA retirement pension fund that we still have folks that we're obligated to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11848)|
| 3:17:34| even though it closed, as I understand it, several decades ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11854)|
| 3:17:38| But, Mr. Thomas, do you want to speak to where that is funded within the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11858)|
| 3:17:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11864)|
| 3:17:45| The Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System provides us with a percentage that the employer is responsible for contributing each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11865)|
| 3:17:53| And then at that point, once teachers retire, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11873)|
| 3:17:56| that pension is drawn from the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System, the state system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11876)|
| 3:18:01| And as Dr. McIntyre referred to, the old city pension, which went out of existence back sometime in the 70s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11881)|
| 3:18:09| we still have a few employees who are on the City A plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11889)|
| 3:18:15| And there is a contribution that the board makes for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11895)|
| 3:18:18| And years ago, that kept increasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11898)|
| 3:18:21| And at some point in time, maybe during Mr. Kessel's term or Mr. Shumpert's term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11901)|
| 3:18:27| there was a bond issue to fund that pension plan over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11907)|
| 3:18:31| And, of course, it was based on the assumption that it was going to earn a certain amount of money each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11911)|
| 3:18:36| Of course, the economy went the way that it did this year, and we're having to put more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11916)|
| 3:18:42| It was a little over $2 million was the initial projection that would need to go into that City A plan to fund those teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11922)|
| 3:18:48| We started out with several hundred teachers back years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11928)|
| 3:18:51| There's probably less than a hundred now maybe that are in that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11931)|
| 3:18:55| But there's a long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11935)|
| 3:18:56| Is that the $650,000 then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11936)|
| 3:18:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11939)|
| 3:19:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11941)|
| 3:19:02| Because it's in principles, it says defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11942)|
| 3:19:04| So that's the old city teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11944)|
| 3:19:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11945)|
| 3:19:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11946)|
| 3:19:07| And if the pension fund that the majority of the teachers are drawing from has a deficit, that's the state's problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11947)|
| 3:19:13| Well, we have to contribute a certain percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11953)|
| 3:19:16| Each teacher contributes 5% out of their paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11956)|
| 3:19:19| But then the system is also responsible for a percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11959)|
| 3:19:23| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11963)|
| 3:19:24| I think that percentage may be about 4.3 or 4%, I think, right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11964)|
| 3:19:30| It varies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11970)|
| 3:19:31| It fluctuates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11971)|
| 3:19:32| The Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System tells us each year what that percentage needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11972)|
| 3:19:37| And then we budget for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11977)|
| 3:19:38| So Knox County is responsible for a portion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11978)|
| 3:19:42| And then the employee is responsible for a portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11982)|
| 3:19:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11984)|
| 3:19:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11985)|
| 3:19:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11986)|
| 3:19:47| Other than that, Dr. McIntyre, I'd just say I appreciate your being in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11987)|
| 3:19:51| And the openness that you've presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11991)|
| 3:19:54| And I attended some of the meetings you had at some of the West Knoxville schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11994)|
| 3:19:59| I think one in North Knoxville also where you presented the budget to citizens and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=11999)|
| 3:20:03| And I've enjoyed seeing you in India.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12003)|
| 3:20:06| And Dr. Murphy, my representative, go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12006)|
| 3:20:09| And thank you for giving us a reasonable budget, not an ask for 450 and hope you get 400 kind of budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12009)|
| 3:20:15| I think I see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12015)|
| 3:20:17| And, as you know, I have a child in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12017)|
| 3:20:19| And I'm in his school two or three days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12019)|
| 3:20:22| And so I hear from the teachers what the new guy is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12022)|
| 3:20:26| And for the vast majority of the people I talk to, they're excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12026)|
| 3:20:31| And there's a lot of buzz about block scheduling, whatever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12031)|
| 3:20:35| They like it or they do it better in elementary anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12035)|
| 3:20:38| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12038)|
| 3:20:39| So thank you for what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12039)|
| 3:20:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12040)|
| 3:20:41| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12041)|
| 3:20:42| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12042)|
| 3:20:43| No, I'd love to speak about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12043)|
| 3:20:44| If it's not too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12044)|
| 3:20:45| When we talked about it in some of our investments, when we talked about our investments in human capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12045)|
| 3:20:48| and teacher collaboration and professional learning communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12048)|
| 3:20:52| parallel block scheduling is a bit of an investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12052)|
| 3:20:55| There is a dollar value associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12055)|
| 3:20:59| But what we have done is put this scheduling mechanism in place in all of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12059)|
| 3:21:05| And what it basically does is it schedules your related arts periods, your arts and your music| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12065)|
| 3:21:12| and your physical education basically at the same time so that it frees up teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12072)|
| 3:21:17| So, for example, all of your third grade teachers could meet together and work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12077)|
| 3:21:21| and collaborate at a particular point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12081)|
| 3:21:24| So the way that we funded that was we had parallel block scheduling in all but 12 of our elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12084)|
| 3:21:31| And part of what we did was we took a slight tradeoff in terms of class size at grades 4 and 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12091)|
| 3:21:38| to be able to reallocate some of those dollars to ensure we were able to do parallel block scheduling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12098)|
| 3:21:42| at each of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12102)|
| 3:21:43| So it basically is a way of allowing for teachers to have time to collaborate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12103)|
| 3:21:49| and work together within their grade levels or within their functional areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12109)|
| 3:21:54| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12114)|
| 3:21:55| It seems to be popular at the schools I hear from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12115)|
| 3:21:58| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12118)|
| 3:21:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12119)|
| 3:22:00| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12120)|
| 3:22:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12121)|
| 3:22:02| Dr. McIntyre, I also will add my voice of thanks for what I consider to be a very transparent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12122)|
| 3:22:09| and readable budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12129)|
| 3:22:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12130)|
| 3:22:11| You touched on this briefly just a moment ago or at least partially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12131)|
| 3:22:16| Do you anticipate or do you know if there is going to be a substantial increase in the number of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12136)|
| 3:22:24| that you're going to experience next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12144)|
| 3:22:27| We don't know for sure yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12147)|
| 3:22:29| We are anticipating that we will likely see some growth, potentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12149)|
| 3:22:35| especially if the economy continues the way that it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12155)|
| 3:22:38| We anticipate that we'll see some growth in terms of students who are currently in private schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12158)|
| 3:22:44| or in the parochial schools potentially making the choice to come to the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12164)|
| 3:22:48| So we anticipate some growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12168)|
| 3:22:50| We are in the first year, really, of trying to project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12170)|
| 3:22:54| As part of this budget formula that we've done for schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12174)|
| 3:22:57| part of that exercise was to try to project enrollments for each school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12177)|
| 3:23:01| because the allocation of resources is based on your projected enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12181)|
| 3:23:06| It's based on the number of students that you're likely to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12186)|
| 3:23:09| the concentration of kids in poverty that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12189)|
| 3:23:11| and the programmatic mix that you're going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12191)|
| 3:23:13| So our definition of equity is that if two schools have exactly the same enrollment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12193)|
| 3:23:18| and exactly the same programmatic mix and demographics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12198)|
| 3:23:21| they would get exactly the same general fund budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12201)|
| 3:23:23| So as part of that exercise, we've tried to project enrollment at individual schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12203)|
| 3:23:27| but it is our first year of doing that, and it is an inexact science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12207)|
| 3:23:31| So we've set aside some resources within this budget, several hundred thousand dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12211)|
| 3:23:35| about a half million dollars, in order to be prepared to meet our obligations under the BEP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12215)|
| 3:23:41| under the basic education plan for the state, to meet our class size obligations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12221)|
| 3:23:45| in case those enrollment projections are off by some percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12225)|
| 3:23:49| So we've set aside some resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12229)|
| 3:23:51| But overall, I think we do anticipate at least modest growth for the coming year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12231)|
| 3:23:56| in part based on folks making the choice to leave private and parochial schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12236)|
| 3:24:00| and come to the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12240)|
| 3:24:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12242)|
| 3:24:03| Just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12243)|
| 3:24:05| The few meetings we've had with commissioners and school board members and administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12245)|
| 3:24:10| and the KCEA have been very helpful to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12250)|
| 3:24:13| I hope that those will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12253)|
| 3:24:15| Thank you for those efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12255)|
| 3:24:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12256)|
| 3:24:19| Seeing no further likes, thank you, Dr. McIntyre and Ms. Kincannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12259)|
| 3:24:24| I appreciate you all being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12264)|
| 3:24:26| I appreciate what you all are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12266)|
| 3:24:27| I think we're doing an excellent job over there, and keep up the good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12267)|
| 3:24:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12272)|
| 3:24:33| One last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12273)|
| 3:24:34| We did have some conversation when the board adopted this budget that it was indeed a very realistic budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12274)|
| 3:24:39| and it was not an inflated budget, but that if there were additional resources that were to be had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12279)|
| 3:24:44| and if there were additional resources that could be allocated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12284)|
| 3:24:47| an additional $2 million certainly would come in handy to mitigate some of the teacher reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12287)|
| 3:24:52| and position reductions that were put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12292)|
| 3:24:54| So I would ask the commission to certainly keep that in the back of their mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12294)|
| 3:24:57| as you continue your deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12297)|
| 3:24:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12299)|
| 3:25:00| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12300)|
| 3:25:01| I appreciate the lean budget you give us this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12301)|
| 3:25:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12305)|
| 3:25:09| We're going to get into community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12309)|
| 3:25:13| We're going to give each of them that have signed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12313)|
| 3:25:16| and if any of them representatives have come since and have not signed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12316)|
| 3:25:21| if you can see Jolie over here and we'll add you to the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12321)|
| 3:25:28| Once we get into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12328)|
| 3:25:30| Can we take a five-minute break first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12330)|
| 3:25:33| We can, but let me just tell you what we're going to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12333)|
| 3:25:37| We're going to do the community grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12337)|
| 3:25:40| and then I'm going to open it up to anybody here to the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12340)|
| 3:25:45| If there's citizens that just want to speak to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12345)|
| 3:25:48| and then we're going to get into the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12348)|
| 3:25:51| So we'll take a five-minute break, and I do mean five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12351)|
| 3:25:54| because we are running behind now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12354)|
| 3:25:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12358)|
| 3:25:59| If everybody will take their seats, we're going to get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12359)|
| 3:26:29| Take the bag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12389)|
| 3:26:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12392)|
| 3:26:41| Everybody take their seats, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12401)|
| 3:26:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12408)|
| 3:26:49| First up is WDVX Cumberland Community Communications, Jenny Casey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12409)|
| 3:27:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12424)|
| 3:27:05| You've got two minutes, and if you'll just identify yourself by name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12425)|
| 3:27:11| My name is Jenny Everett Casey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12431)|
| 3:27:14| and I reside at 2424 Caspian Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12434)|
| 3:27:20| I'm here to represent WDVX,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12440)|
| 3:27:22| and I just want to thank everybody here for listening to everyone here today about the community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12442)|
| 3:27:28| I'm representing WDVX's application primarily concerning the Blue Plate Special,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12448)|
| 3:27:33| which is a daily free live radio broadcast, which is broadcast out of the Knoxville Visitor Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12453)|
| 3:27:41| We host several different independent regional, local,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12461)|
| 3:27:51| and what we consider underrepresented artists through the Blue Plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12471)|
| 3:27:57| Primarily it's music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12477)|
| 3:27:58| We do poetry readings occasionally, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12478)|
| 3:28:03| I just wanted to emphasize that there are three major assets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12483)|
| 3:28:07| that the Blue Plate Special represents for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12487)|
| 3:28:10| First, we're a cultural asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12490)|
| 3:28:12| We're promoting music which is indigenous to the United States, especially this region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12492)|
| 3:28:17| We are considered a tourist attraction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12497)|
| 3:28:19| and we are attracting an average daily attendance of over 100 people to the live performances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12499)|
| 3:28:25| with an estimated 1,500 listeners online every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12505)|
| 3:28:29| We're also a community asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12509)|
| 3:28:31| We host school groups, tourist groups, young families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12511)|
| 3:28:36| and we also promote local businesses and other nonprofits through these media channels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12516)|
| 3:28:42| especially the Blue Plate Special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12522)|
| 3:28:44| We're also a commerce asset because we are completely free and open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12524)|
| 3:28:50| Everyone has access and can listen to what we are broadcasting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12530)|
| 3:28:54| and we primarily promote and work with local businesses and local nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12534)|
| 3:28:59| So not only are we an asset, but we are an asset giving out back to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12539)|
| 3:29:03| So I just wanted to emphasize that, those three major points of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12543)|
| 3:29:08| that show that we're an asset to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12548)|
| 3:29:11| and I just want to thank you all very much for having us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12551)|
| 3:29:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12553)|
| 3:29:14| Do we have anything for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12554)|
| 3:29:16| If not, we're going to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12556)|
| 3:29:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12558)|
| 3:29:21| Knoxville Opera, Brian Selski.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12561)|
| 3:29:24| Brian Selski, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12564)|
| 3:29:26| Selski.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12566)|
| 3:29:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12567)|
| 3:29:28| Ladies and gentlemen, first of all, thank you very much for having us here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12568)|
| 3:29:32| I do need your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12572)|
| 3:29:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12576)|
| 3:29:37| Brian Selski, 1709 Regents Park Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12577)|
| 3:29:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12583)|
| 3:29:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12584)|
| 3:29:45| Again, thank you very much for having us here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12585)|
| 3:29:49| The Knoxville Opera Company has just completed its 31st year, and here's the good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12589)|
| 3:29:56| The good news is that for the fourth consecutive year, we finished the year debt-free and in the black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12596)|
| 3:30:04| That is something that is rare in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12604)|
| 3:30:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12607)|
| 3:30:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12608)|
| 3:30:09| It's rare in the world of the 501C3 nation to be able to accomplish this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12609)|
| 3:30:15| especially when you're a very small company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12615)|
| 3:30:20| So my thanks to everyone who's involved in my company and all of our supporters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12620)|
| 3:30:26| I'm specifically here today to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12626)|
| 3:30:30| I also want to thank Gloria Ray and the Knoxville Tourism and Sports Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12630)|
| 3:30:37| who, along with, I believe, Mayor Ragsdale yesterday, made a wonderful announcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12637)|
| 3:30:43| which helped us tremendously because, as you may be aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12643)|
| 3:30:48| our previous grant monies of last year of $71,000 were eradicated from the fiscal 10 budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12648)|
| 3:30:56| and we are now going to receive $25,000 to make up a portion of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12656)|
| 3:31:02| and we are so very, very grateful for this support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12662)|
| 3:31:05| The Knoxville Opera Company is your opera company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12665)|
| 3:31:10| It's our opera company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12670)|
| 3:31:11| It's our community's opera company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12671)|
| 3:31:13| It's East Tennessee's opera company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12673)|
| 3:31:15| And when I say thank you to you folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12675)|
| 3:31:18| I'm saying thank you to you on behalf of about 10,000 children a year who get to interact with our company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12678)|
| 3:31:27| who get an in-school program, who come to a student dress rehearsal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12687)|
| 3:31:31| who come to that Rossini Festival Italian Street Fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12691)|
| 3:31:35| and who have nine hours of free entertainment on four stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12695)|
| 3:31:39| I'm saying thank you on behalf of the people in the various civic organizations who, again, have access to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12699)|
| 3:31:48| I'm saying thank you on behalf of 500-plus musicians and artists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12708)|
| 3:31:53| including the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra, who benefit from our being in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12713)|
| 3:31:58| I'm saying thank you to you on behalf of our audiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12718)|
| 3:32:03| I'm saying thank you to you on behalf of all of the people who are affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12723)|
| 3:32:08| I'm saying thank you to you on behalf of the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12728)|
| 3:32:12| I'm saying thank you on behalf of the commerce that is done in our city because of the Knoxville Opera Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12732)|
| 3:32:19| It is a gift. It is a treasure to have a company of our size in a city of this size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12739)|
| 3:32:25| I just would hope that in future years, when you consider the budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12745)|
| 3:32:30| that you would remember that it takes all of us arts organizations to make a cultural fabric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12750)|
| 3:32:37| And in saying that, I'm speaking on behalf of all of my colleagues who are both sitting here and those who are not here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12757)|
| 3:32:44| I'm saying that on behalf of all of the boards of directors who work so diligently to ensure that we have a future of our cultural fabric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12764)|
| 3:32:54| I'll take questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12774)|
| 3:32:56| Mr. Lambert, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12776)|
| 3:32:59| Yes. You say last year you finished in the black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12779)|
| 3:33:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12782)|
| 3:33:03| How far in the black did you finish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12783)|
| 3:33:06| We finished in the black approximately $230,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12786)|
| 3:33:13| Okay. Great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12793)|
| 3:33:16| Now, I know you'll be getting considerably less than you got last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12796)|
| 3:33:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12801)|
| 3:33:22| And I'll go ahead and say, as a conservative, I really believe that if we lived in a perfect world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12802)|
| 3:33:28| it would be nice if these organizations were funded with private donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12808)|
| 3:33:33| But with that said, we don't live in a perfect world, so government frequently steps up with grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12813)|
| 3:33:40| You're getting considerably less than you got last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12820)|
| 3:33:44| What I'm wondering is, can you survive those kind of cuts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12824)|
| 3:33:48| or is your organization still going to be financially sound with the level of funding that you'll be getting this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12828)|
| 3:33:56| Thank you for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12836)|
| 3:33:58| The Board of Directors of Knoxville Opera has approved a budget for fiscal 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12838)|
| 3:34:04| which is approximately 30 percent less than the fiscal 9 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12844)|
| 3:34:09| In doing so, we've had to make, as you can well appreciate, some very severe cuts in various areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12849)|
| 3:34:17| We have just laid off two people, hoping to hire back one or two, depending upon stimulus grants from the NEA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12857)|
| 3:34:26| And we have reduced the salaries of two other employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12866)|
| 3:34:30| and we have eliminated entirely an hourly position that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12870)|
| 3:34:37| In terms of our production budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12877)|
| 3:34:39| I'm here to assure you that we will have two major stage productions next year at the Tennessee Theater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12879)|
| 3:34:45| as we have in the past several years, one in February and one in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12885)|
| 3:34:50| We will continue to produce the Rossini Festival Italian Street Fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12890)|
| 3:34:54| which I know is beloved by just about everybody in Knoxville and East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12894)|
| 3:34:59| Thanks to the good weather, 70,000 people enjoyed that this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12899)|
| 3:35:03| And while it's very challenging to take 30 percent away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12903)|
| 3:35:11| the one thing that I wake up every single day knowing is that we are 100 percent committed to delivering the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12911)|
| 3:35:20| and the contributions to this community, no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12920)|
| 3:35:27| The challenge may be great, but I'm here to promise you that we will meet that challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12927)|
| 3:35:32| even with a 30 percent reduction and even with going from 71 to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12932)|
| 3:35:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12937)|
| 3:35:38| Well, that's, like I said, I know times are tough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12938)|
| 3:35:40| and I just wanted to make sure that the reduction wasn't going to kill you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12940)|
| 3:35:44| because I think what you do is very valuable for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12944)|
| 3:35:47| I appreciate you saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12947)|
| 3:35:48| I appreciate your sentiments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12948)|
| 3:35:50| And like I said, that's my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12950)|
| 3:35:53| And I wake up 365 days a year knowing what I've got to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12953)|
| 3:35:58| So far, so good, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12958)|
| 3:36:03| Commissioner Ed Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12963)|
| 3:36:04| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12964)|
| 3:36:06| Thank you for what you do for the opera and for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12966)|
| 3:36:09| And I'm repeating something you said a moment ago, but the Rossini Festival, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12969)|
| 3:36:14| the premier close-the-streets-off festival in Knoxville now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12974)|
| 3:36:20| We know the success of Sundown in the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12980)|
| 3:36:22| Well, it's Sundown in the City on steroids, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12982)|
| 3:36:26| It's just fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12986)|
| 3:36:27| When we go, it's been seven or eight hours there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12987)|
| 3:36:29| As long as there's good weather, I think you'll have a great crowd there, and thanks for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12989)|
| 3:36:34| Well, we appreciate your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12994)|
| 3:36:35| And, of course, I think I'm preaching to the choir here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12995)|
| 3:36:38| because I think everyone in the room has enjoyed the Rossini Festival street fair at one point or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=12998)|
| 3:36:44| And, yes, when we lose funding for anything, we have to tighten our belts, and we will tighten our belts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13004)|
| 3:36:51| I'm not here to say it's business as usual, because it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13011)|
| 3:36:54| But we will produce that street fair, and maybe we won't have four stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13014)|
| 3:36:58| Maybe we'll have three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13018)|
| 3:36:59| Maybe we'll have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13019)|
| 3:37:00| Maybe we won't run it from 12 to 9, four stages simultaneously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13020)|
| 3:37:05| But there will be entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13025)|
| 3:37:06| There will be food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13026)|
| 3:37:07| There will be vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13027)|
| 3:37:08| There will be this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13028)|
| 3:37:09| There will be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13029)|
| 3:37:10| And there, of course, will be opera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13030)|
| 3:37:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13033)|
| 3:37:14| I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13034)|
| 3:37:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13036)|
| 3:37:17| All right, next we're going to hear from Jim Dixon, YMCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13037)|
| 3:37:26| And if you'll just state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13046)|
| 3:37:31| Jim Dixon, 9710 Haversack Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13051)|
| 3:37:35| And I actually didn't sign up to speak, but I'm here if anybody has any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13055)|
| 3:37:39| Somehow we got your name down here on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13059)|
| 3:37:42| I know you're under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13062)|
| 3:37:44| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13064)|
| 3:37:45| Instead of the nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13065)|
| 3:37:48| But I'll give you your two minutes if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13068)|
| 3:37:52| Well, last year we were under the community grants process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13072)|
| 3:37:56| This year we are under the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13076)|
| 3:37:59| and we extended the pledge for Knox County to build our counselor, YMCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13079)|
| 3:38:06| That was being paid at $100,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13086)|
| 3:38:09| So far we've had a little under $800,000 that's been paid to the Y| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13089)|
| 3:38:15| so that we can fulfill our loan obligations for the counselor, Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13095)|
| 3:38:20| And we extended it to the $50,000 a year for the next four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13100)|
| 3:38:25| instead of trying to stay on that higher level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13105)|
| 3:38:29| Appreciate your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13109)|
| 3:38:31| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13111)|
| 3:38:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13113)|
| 3:38:35| Are you starting the Davis Family YMCA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13115)|
| 3:38:38| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13118)|
| 3:38:40| I believe that started today, didn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13120)|
| 3:38:42| Well, the sun's out, so hopefully there's a grater out there moving dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13122)|
| 3:38:46| Is that money figured in, any of this money here figured into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13126)|
| 3:38:49| or is this going to be money you're going to need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13129)|
| 3:38:52| No, this is money that is being used to pay the loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13132)|
| 3:38:56| When we built the counselor, YMCA, six, seven years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13136)|
| 3:39:01| we took out a bridge loan to be able to go ahead and build the Y based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13141)|
| 3:39:05| pledges from the community, which included the county pledges in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13145)|
| 3:39:10| So that is solely for the counselor, YMCA, over off Jessamine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13150)|
| 3:39:15| Are you going to be coming to us for money for the Davis Family YMCA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13155)|
| 3:39:19| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13159)|
| 3:39:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13160)|
| 3:39:23| However, if you'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13163)|
| 3:39:27| We don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13167)|
| 3:39:28| That's the reason why I was asking you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13168)|
| 3:39:29| That's why we went to $50,000 a year trying to help things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13169)|
| 3:39:32| Appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13172)|
| 3:39:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13174)|
| 3:39:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13176)|
| 3:39:37| Kim Weaver with the Knoxville Academy of Medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13177)|
| 3:39:45| And just your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13185)|
| 3:39:47| Hi, I'm actually here in Kempstead today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13187)|
| 3:39:49| I'm Rebecca Mollis, 115 Suburban Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13189)|
| 3:39:54| She was unable to make it today, so I'm here in her place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13194)|
| 3:39:57| I am representing Knoxville Area Project Access, or CAPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13197)|
| 3:40:01| Again, my name is Rebecca Mollis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13201)|
| 3:40:03| and I'm the Director of Provider Relations for the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13203)|
| 3:40:06| CAPA was founded by the physicians of the Knoxville Academy of Medicine in 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13206)|
| 3:40:11| during the TennCare disenrollment of 190,000 Tennesseans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13211)|
| 3:40:15| We were founded to provide much-needed access to health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13215)|
| 3:40:19| for low-income, uninsured Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13219)|
| 3:40:24| We have a firm belief that to improve the health of a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13224)|
| 3:40:27| a full range of both primary care and specialty care must be available to the uninsured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13227)|
| 3:40:33| To accomplish this, we knew we had to develop a network of physicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13233)|
| 3:40:37| and hospitals to care for these patients at no cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13237)|
| 3:40:42| Since about three years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13242)|
| 3:40:44| CAPA has grown to be one of the largest programs of its kind in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13244)|
| 3:40:49| CAPA has enrolled over 11,000 patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13249)|
| 3:40:52| who receive care from a network of currently 902 physicians in all Knox County hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13252)|
| 3:40:59| Approximately $23 million in health care has been donated by this network in the past three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13259)|
| 3:41:06| Additionally, we work together with our partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13266)|
| 3:41:09| to provide specialty care for their primary care patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13269)|
| 3:41:12| Those are Interfaith Health Clinic, Dr. Kim's Free Clinic of America, and Cherokee Health Systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13272)|
| 3:41:20| Knox County and its citizens have regularly received national press| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13280)|
| 3:41:26| because of CAPA's innovative approach to a community taking care of its neighbors in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13286)|
| 3:41:33| Since the physicians and hospitals donate the care for CAPA patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13293)|
| 3:41:38| largely our program expense is personnel to coordinate these donated services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13298)|
| 3:41:45| At our current patient level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13305)|
| 3:41:47| we anticipate that physicians and hospitals will donate over $18 million in care this year alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13307)|
| 3:41:53| It will cost us less than $650,000 to make that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13313)|
| 3:41:58| so the return on investment is over $17 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13318)|
| 3:42:03| Unfortunately, this year in the proposed Knox County budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13323)|
| 3:42:06| Knoxville Area Project Access was not awarded a community grant to help sustain our operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13326)|
| 3:42:12| It's my job as the Director of Provider Relations to ensure that physicians are recruited to participate in the network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13332)|
| 3:42:19| as well as maintaining the network of providers who have already pledged to see these patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13339)|
| 3:42:24| It's difficult for me, and I'm afraid that it will become even more difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13344)|
| 3:42:30| to continue to convince 902 physicians to treat these patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13350)|
| 3:42:35| and provide $18 million in donated care with a Knox County government that's not willing to fund our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13355)|
| 3:42:47| And I'm open to take questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13367)|
| 3:42:49| Do we have any questions? Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13369)|
| 3:42:54| Last year you had funding of $45,000, $50,000, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13374)|
| 3:42:59| We did not have any community grant funding last year at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13379)|
| 3:43:04| Come through contracted services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13384)|
| 3:43:05| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13385)|
| 3:43:06| Okay, and you've had a slight reduction in that in contracted services this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13386)|
| 3:43:09| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13389)|
| 3:43:10| Okay. All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13390)|
| 3:43:13| Any other questions? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13393)|
| 3:43:17| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13397)|
| 3:43:20| Allison Teeters, keep Knoxville beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13400)|
| 3:43:25| Good afternoon. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13405)|
| 3:43:27| I am Allison Teeters, 100 South Gay Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13407)|
| 3:43:34| And I thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13414)|
| 3:43:36| Not just today, but you guys do a lot of echoing, so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13416)|
| 3:43:41| You're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13421)|
| 3:43:43| Several of you have come out and you've volunteered with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13423)|
| 3:43:47| You serve on committees with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13427)|
| 3:43:49| You help us along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13429)|
| 3:43:51| We are a small nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13431)|
| 3:43:54| I'm the only full-time employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13434)|
| 3:43:57| We have a staff of two AmeriCorps workers currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13437)|
| 3:44:01| We're reducing that to one AmeriCorps worker next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13441)|
| 3:44:05| So for $6,300, we're getting 40 hours a week for 10 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13445)|
| 3:44:13| And with the staff we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13453)|
| 3:44:15| we don't even begin to be able to cover everything that I would like to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13455)|
| 3:44:19| We do a lot of education, but we really tend to focus on the youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13459)|
| 3:44:24| I have a little handout for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13464)|
| 3:44:26| Brought you a car litter bag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13466)|
| 3:44:29| Everybody needs them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13469)|
| 3:44:31| Just to make sure you keep it in your car and doesn't slide out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13471)|
| 3:44:35| But in there, there is an invitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13475)|
| 3:44:37| And this is a save-the-date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13477)|
| 3:44:39| On June 18th, in the small assembly room, we're doing a litter law forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13479)|
| 3:44:45| Now this is for police officers, judges, DAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13485)|
| 3:44:50| We want to educate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13490)|
| 3:44:52| There are far too many littering cases that are thrown out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13492)|
| 3:44:56| because it's a tiny thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13496)|
| 3:45:00| Well, those tiny things really add up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13500)|
| 3:45:03| But I do have some good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13503)|
| 3:45:05| Several community groups this year have reported less litter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13505)|
| 3:45:09| on the roads that they've been cleaning for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13509)|
| 3:45:12| I had two groups in particular who called me and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13512)|
| 3:45:15| I can't believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13515)|
| 3:45:16| We have had less this year and had more people standing around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13516)|
| 3:45:19| because we did not have as much as we usually do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13519)|
| 3:45:22| So thank you for your continued support and funding, and we appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13522)|
| 3:45:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13529)|
| 3:45:31| Mike Brown, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13531)|
| 3:45:32| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13532)|
| 3:45:34| Back some years ago when I was volunteering with the Beautification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13534)|
| 3:45:38| we called it the Beautification Board then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13538)|
| 3:45:41| Judge Rawson set up a special court to prosecute litterers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13541)|
| 3:45:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13548)|
| 3:45:49| Are you still using that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13549)|
| 3:45:50| I know that talking with Bruce Weitrich through the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13550)|
| 3:45:56| that they have that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13556)|
| 3:45:58| Are you all still using that program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13558)|
| 3:46:00| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13560)|
| 3:46:01| Judge Rawson is a city court judge, and he does hear the city cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13561)|
| 3:46:05| In addition, Judge Stansberry has been doing the environmental court cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13565)|
| 3:46:09| for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13569)|
| 3:46:10| And Judge Stansberry is actually helping me to organize the Litter Law Forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13570)|
| 3:46:13| to address the issue of small citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13573)|
| 3:46:16| Are you still getting a lot of public call-ins on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13576)|
| 3:46:20| We are, but actually the state is handling all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13580)|
| 3:46:23| The state took away our power to do the I-SPY.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13583)|
| 3:46:27| It now goes through the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13587)|
| 3:46:28| They get a letter from the Highway Patrol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13588)|
| 3:46:31| which seems to have a little bit more backbone behind it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13591)|
| 3:46:35| because I have no power, thankfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13595)|
| 3:46:37| And they also get, if they're caught littering paper or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13597)|
| 3:46:40| they get a car litter bag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13600)|
| 3:46:42| And if they're littering cigarettes, they get a pocket ashtray,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13602)|
| 3:46:45| is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13605)|
| 3:46:47| Well, my question just went out the window,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13607)|
| 3:46:54| but that's what happens when you get old, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13614)|
| 3:46:58| Feel free to call me with any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13618)|
| 3:47:00| and I'll be happy to answer them any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13620)|
| 3:47:02| Well, I know that when we started that program, we did a lot of advertising on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13622)|
| 3:47:08| I'm not seeing anything on that lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13628)|
| 3:47:10| Call-in, call-in, call-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13630)|
| 3:47:12| We're really trying to work towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13632)|
| 3:47:14| The state's been doing it with the Stop Litter billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13634)|
| 3:47:17| and that's kind of part of what was behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13637)|
| 3:47:20| We really want people just to stop littering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13640)|
| 3:47:23| We get calls all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13643)|
| 3:47:25| Unfortunately, you have to be kept reminded of that fact, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13645)|
| 3:47:29| We're hoping that the Litter Law Forum will do that to some extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13649)|
| 3:47:32| We're going to be doing a cigarette litter prevention program in the halls area this summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13652)|
| 3:47:39| so that we can really go out against the cigarette butts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13659)|
| 3:47:42| We did it downtown a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13662)|
| 3:47:44| We're just trying different things in different areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13664)|
| 3:47:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13667)|
| 3:47:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13668)|
| 3:47:49| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13669)|
| 3:47:50| One thing I'd like to see you work on, speaking of litter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13670)|
| 3:47:52| I'd like to see you work and work with us on this is to keep the litter off telephone poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13672)|
| 3:47:56| There are so many signs on the telephone poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13676)|
| 3:47:58| I mean, the numbers right there, and we've got these judges in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13678)|
| 3:48:01| We need to be able to do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13681)|
| 3:48:03| And if we did it for a month, the word would get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13683)|
| 3:48:06| It would get out in the newspapers not to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13686)|
| 3:48:09| I mean, you don't go down Sequoia Hills and find stuff on telephone poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13689)|
| 3:48:12| To me, it's about community pride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13692)|
| 3:48:14| And I think we need to put some enforcement behind it, and I'd like to work with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13694)|
| 3:48:18| Well, I think we would have to put that into an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13698)|
| 3:48:21| because I have been looking at the city and the county ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13701)|
| 3:48:24| and there is nothing about signs on poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13704)|
| 3:48:26| Oh, yes, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13706)|
| 3:48:27| Is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13707)|
| 3:48:28| Yes, there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13708)|
| 3:48:29| Well, then I need to find it because I couldn't find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13709)|
| 3:48:31| I've been doing some scouting and trying to make cheat cards for the police officers and the judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13711)|
| 3:48:36| I found that out the hard way one evening when I put up a sign for a picnic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13716)|
| 3:48:40| Well, I know that KUB has a huge issue with it, and we try and keep it off and pull it off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13720)|
| 3:48:46| because one of the hardest things is the staples and everything else that goes into them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13726)|
| 3:48:51| And I can tell you that from pulling those off and from picking up litter, I have war wounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13731)|
| 3:48:56| Right now I'm still recovering from poison ivy from picking up litter on the side of the road a couple weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13736)|
| 3:49:03| I've got an 18-foot pole, and I just jerk them right off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13743)|
| 3:49:07| See, I appreciate your help, Commissioner Smith, because I know that you're out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13747)|
| 3:49:12| I try to keep a clean community, community pride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13752)|
| 3:49:15| Community pride is a big thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13755)|
| 3:49:17| We're trying to get that with the students and the adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13757)|
| 3:49:20| The adults seem to think that your job as county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13760)|
| 3:49:25| and the government's job is to clean up after them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13765)|
| 3:49:28| And Keep Knoxville Beautiful cannot go to everybody's house and clean up after you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13768)|
| 3:49:33| I'm not your mother. I don't want to be your mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13773)|
| 3:49:36| But I will be glad to go out there and stand next to you and work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13776)|
| 3:49:40| I don't ask my volunteers to do anything I'm not willing to do myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13780)|
| 3:49:45| Thank you very much for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13785)|
| 3:49:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13787)|

| 3:49:52| Lisa Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13792)|
| 3:49:56| I'm Lisa Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13796)|
| 3:49:58| I reside at 8119 Greenwell Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13798)|
| 3:50:04| Thank you, commissioners, for what you do every day for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13804)|
| 3:50:08| In these tough economic times when we were all examining our giving to reflect our priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13808)|
| 3:50:15| we are especially thankful for your support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13815)|
| 3:50:18| and the Knoxville Tourism and Sports Corps' support of the Dogwood Arts Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13818)|
| 3:50:23| The vitality and health of a community is enhanced with a vibrant, creative culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13823)|
| 3:50:30| The Dogwood Arts Festival enriches the quality of life, civic pride, and morale of Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13830)|
| 3:50:39| Individuals of all ages, races, gender, beliefs, and backgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13839)|
| 3:50:46| help build a stronger community as they work together year-round to plan the festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13846)|
| 3:50:53| This year, your support helped us re-energize the festival and launch new events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13853)|
| 3:51:00| We not only improved the quality of the programming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13860)|
| 3:51:04| we also increased the awareness, participation, and attendance of the festival events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13864)|
| 3:51:11| We are very proud of our outcomes and exceeded all of the goals established for the Knox County Community Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13871)|
| 3:51:20| In the midst of a turbulent economy, the 2009 festival was a success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13880)|
| 3:51:28| Not only one of the most beautiful festivals, but in terms of outreach and attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13888)|
| 3:51:35| We could not be more thrilled with the overwhelming increase in numbers and diversity of our volunteers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13895)|
| 3:51:44| in numbers and quality of the visual and performing artists submitting and participating in exhibits and performances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13904)|
| 3:51:53| in new collaborative partnerships with area art and culture institutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13913)|
| 3:52:00| in tremendous media coverage and successful marketing outreach in local, regional, and national levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13920)|
| 3:52:09| and in greatly increased numbers of residents and visitors alike attending all the events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13929)|
| 3:52:18| The support of Knox County helped us achieve these goals as corporate and private donations that we seek every day became harder to secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13938)|
| 3:52:30| In partnership with Knox County, the City, the Chamber, and the Tourism and Sports Corp.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13950)|
| 3:52:37| we are using our community festival as a tool to help grow the awareness of our vibrant, creative culture here in East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13957)|
| 3:52:48| and to positively impact our economy by attracting tourism, new residents, businesses, and their workforces to our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13968)|
| 3:53:00| Working together, we can achieve these goals, and we appreciate your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13980)|
| 3:53:07| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13987)|
| 3:53:09| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13989)|
| 3:53:11| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13991)|
| 3:53:13| I'd like to give two shameless plugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13993)|
| 3:53:15| One, on your decision to choose what I feel is the most beautiful dogwood trail, the Holston Hills Trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=13995)|
| 3:53:22| You all did a wonderful job presenting that, and all the trails are magnificent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14002)|
| 3:53:29| And the second, you know, in these tough times, I'm active with the ORNL Federal Credit Union,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14009)|
| 3:53:35| that they've been a stable supporter and, you know, I encourage businesses to get behind these nonprofit organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14015)|
| 3:53:44| these community-based organizations, and support them in tough times and in good times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14024)|
| 3:53:49| and it's good to see that they're still a presenting sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14029)|
| 3:53:53| So, good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14033)|
| 3:53:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14034)|
| 3:53:55| We appreciate ORNL Federal Credit Union's presenting sponsorship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14035)|
| 3:54:00| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14040)|
| 3:54:01| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14041)|
| 3:54:02| Lisa, I just want to say congratulations on a good festival this year, an excellent festival, a resurgent festival, I felt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14042)|
| 3:54:08| And my family and some other close friends participated in the sidewalk art programs you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14048)|
| 3:54:15| You had a very outstanding artist, the lady you brought in from Orlando, who she taught a class at the museum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14055)|
| 3:54:22| and then everybody went out the Saturday and drew, and that was very unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14062)|
| 3:54:27| And I just compliment you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14067)|
| 3:54:30| I think that got a lot of buzz going and got a lot of talk going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14070)|
| 3:54:33| and just created a lot of interest and brought people to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14073)|
| 3:54:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14077)|
| 3:54:40| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14080)|
| 3:54:42| Ms. Duncan, I'm on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14082)|
| 3:54:44| Look the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14084)|
| 3:54:45| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14085)|
| 3:54:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14086)|
| 3:54:49| We in East Knox County would have liked to have participated in the sidewalk chalk thing too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14089)|
| 3:54:55| but Mr. Armstrong here beside me said we don't have sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14095)|
| 3:55:06| Also, I've been accused of, I'll remind myself of something that I talked about the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14106)|
| 3:55:12| the country boy comes to town on Friday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14112)|
| 3:55:15| I came to the Dogwood Arts Parade, but I didn't really come to the Dogwood Arts Parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14115)|
| 3:55:19| I came to the Dogwood Mile, which was immediately after that because Gay Street was still closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14119)|
| 3:55:26| Another new event this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14126)|
| 3:55:28| Yes, and I participated in that event, and I was first in my age group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14128)|
| 3:55:34| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14134)|
| 3:55:39| The most important thing was, though, the first place prize was four Dollywood super season passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14139)|
| 3:55:49| which is an extreme amount of money for a country boy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14149)|
| 3:55:52| Thanks for the program that you've put on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14152)|
| 3:55:55| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14155)|
| 3:55:57| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14157)|
| 3:55:58| Yes, I would just like to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14158)|
| 3:56:00| I know several years ago my wife worked in that and my aunt and uncle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14160)|
| 3:56:05| and they used to bring a lot of money into the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14165)|
| 3:56:08| How much would you anticipate they probably bring in now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14168)|
| 3:56:12| Well, I had a conversation with Gloria Ray earlier last week trying to determine the economic impact of the festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14172)|
| 3:56:20| and without the festival blocking hotel, motel rooms ourselves, we can't really put a number to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14180)|
| 3:56:29| But in answering the phone calls every day at the festival office, we bring a lot of visitors to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14189)|
| 3:56:36| They are not all web savvy and using our directions to our trails, and we're guiding them straight to our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14196)|
| 3:56:47| So we hope to be able to have stronger figures for us in the future so we can bring that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14207)|
| 3:56:56| Do you still run the buses like you used to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14216)|
| 3:56:59| We had buses to our featured trail and to Farragut this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14219)|
| 3:57:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14226)|
| 3:57:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14227)|
| 3:57:10| We have Diane Wright from Cades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14230)|
| 3:57:23| Diane Wright, 136 Wyndham Road, Oak Ridge, and I direct the Cades program, Concord Adult Day Enrichment Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14243)|
| 3:57:31| We are a community outreach resource located in West Knoxville at Concord United Methodist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14251)|
| 3:57:39| and what we do is provide daytime care, assistance, and companionship to senior adults whose needs prevent them from staying at home alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14259)|
| 3:57:50| Most of our folks are suffering from memory and confusion that's associated with Alzheimer's disease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14270)|
| 3:57:56| as well as isolation, depression, and mobility problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14276)|
| 3:58:01| We are licensed by the state of Tennessee, and we're open Monday through Friday from 830 to 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14281)|
| 3:58:08| And what we do is allow seniors to remain in their homes for as long as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14288)|
| 3:58:14| We serve caregivers by giving them much-needed respite, education and support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14294)|
| 3:58:21| and we help families avoid premature institutionalization or changes in living arrangements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14301)|
| 3:58:31| We have served over 80 seniors and their families since we opened three years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14311)|
| 3:58:38| and our fees cover about 70% of what our costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14318)|
| 3:58:42| We're asking for your recognition and your assistance to this important service to senior citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14322)|
| 3:58:50| and their families of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14330)|
| 3:58:54| My name is Elizabeth Ritchie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14334)|
| 3:58:56| I live at 11029 Flotilla Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14336)|
| 3:59:01| Our grant focuses on nutrition and funding for our meal program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14341)|
| 3:59:06| Our midday meal may be the only true meal that our seniors eat during the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14346)|
| 3:59:10| so it's extremely important that they not only enjoy it, but they do eat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14350)|
| 3:59:15| So it has to be not only nutritious but tasteful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14355)|
| 3:59:19| We all know that institutional food is like, and with seniors who are already losing their sense of taste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14359)|
| 3:59:25| when the food quality diminishes, the seniors begin to stop eating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14365)|
| 3:59:29| and it becomes a vicious cycle for them with their health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14369)|
| 3:59:34| They become weaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14374)|
| 3:59:35| They become less involved socially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14375)|
| 3:59:37| Their appetite diminishes further, which decreases their immunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14377)|
| 3:59:41| They become ill, and a downward spiral begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14381)|
| 3:59:45| If we don't receive this grant for Cades, we obviously won't stop feeding our clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14385)|
| 3:59:50| but the money will have to come from somewhere, and that will decrease our ability to give out scholarships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14390)|
| 3:59:56| and perform some of our enrichment activities, and it will affect our staffing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14396)|
| 4:00:01| which will keep us from covering the enrollment costs that we need to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14401)|
| 4:00:06| I'd like to just emphasize some important points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14406)|
| 4:00:11| Our clientele is growing rapidly out in West Knoxville in our service area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14411)|
| 4:00:16| We are the only adult daycare area out in that area, and the commute for another daycare area is 30 minutes one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14416)|
| 4:00:25| That's a two-hour commute for daycare for the providers for our families, and we are income-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14425)|
| 4:00:32| We gave out 352 scholarship days last year, and we are very heavily volunteer-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14432)|
| 4:00:38| with 6,500 hours last year from volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14438)|
| 4:00:42| So we are very much in need of your assistance to help us with keeping Cades going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14442)|
| 4:00:48| and helping with our meal program in an area of West Knoxville that our taxpayers really need your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14448)|
| 4:00:54| If you have any questions, we'd be happy to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14454)|
| 4:00:58| First, I want to disclose I am a member of Concord United Methodist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14458)|
| 4:01:01| but Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14461)|
| 4:01:04| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14464)|
| 4:01:05| You said that 70% is covered by enrollment charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14465)|
| 4:01:08| What do you charge, or what is your total budget, I guess, for the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14468)|
| 4:01:13| Our total budget for this year is $137,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14473)|
| 4:01:19| We charge $50 a day, and we're finding an increasing need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14479)|
| 4:01:25| I guess it has to do with the economy right now where people need our services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14485)|
| 4:01:29| but can't afford our free fees, so we are subsidizing them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14489)|
| 4:01:33| We do ask them to pay a portion, at least half of what the costs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14493)|
| 4:01:38| And if you compare them to other options of care, home care, which does not allow for socialization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14498)|
| 4:01:46| it runs about $17 an hour with a minimum of four hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14506)|
| 4:01:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14510)|
| 4:01:51| And you're at Concord United Methodist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14511)|
| 4:01:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14513)|
| 4:01:54| We operate out of our own budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14514)|
| 4:01:56| They give us the facility, the three rooms there, and utility charges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14516)|
| 4:02:01| but we operate with our own staff out of our own budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14521)|
| 4:02:04| So it's a separate entity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14524)|
| 4:02:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14525)|
| 4:02:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14528)|
| 4:02:09| Well, it's separate and connected because we are located at the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14529)|
| 4:02:13| and we do have grandfathered into their nonprofit status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14533)|
| 4:02:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14538)|
| 4:02:21| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14541)|
| 4:02:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14543)|
| 4:02:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14547)|
| 4:02:28| Next we have Billie Chabot, Blunt Mansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14548)|
| 4:02:37| And I've probably seen it wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14557)|
| 4:02:43| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14563)|
| 4:02:44| My name is Billie Chabot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14564)|
| 4:02:46| The T is silent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14566)|
| 4:02:48| I sit at East Tennessee Styles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14568)|
| 4:02:50| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14570)|
| 4:02:51| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14571)|
| 4:02:52| I reside at 5719 Green Valley Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14572)|
| 4:02:58| I'm here representing Blunt Mansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14578)|
| 4:03:00| and I just want to first off say thank you so much to the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14580)|
| 4:03:04| and many of you have come to attend our programs and our events at Blunt Mansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14584)|
| 4:03:09| I also want to say a big thank you to Gloria Ray and KTSC for stepping forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14589)|
| 4:03:14| to help us with community grants this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14594)|
| 4:03:17| And I also want to say thank you to the community review panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14597)|
| 4:03:22| And over the past two years, I have truly appreciated that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14602)|
| 4:03:26| as it allows small organizations such as Blunt Mansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14606)|
| 4:03:31| I have a budget of around $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14611)|
| 4:03:34| It really helps to level the playing field for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14614)|
| 4:03:38| I'm the only full-time employee at Blunt Mansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14618)|
| 4:03:40| so I don't have a development department or a marketing department to help raise money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14620)|
| 4:03:45| So we really do count on the support of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14625)|
| 4:03:49| We provide educational programming to around 3,000 Knox County students every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14629)|
| 4:03:57| And a trip to Blunt Mansion is so much more than just a field trip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14637)|
| 4:04:01| because the kids really get a good dose of Tennessee history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14641)|
| 4:04:04| and Blunt Mansion represents not only the founding of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14644)|
| 4:04:08| but the founding of our state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14648)|
| 4:04:10| And I just want to say that I appreciate your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14650)|
| 4:04:13| I hope that you will fund us this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14653)|
| 4:04:15| And thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14655)|
| 4:04:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14657)|
| 4:04:20| No questions? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14660)|
| 4:04:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14661)|
| 4:04:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14662)|
| 4:04:24| We have Peggy Coley, Free Medical Clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14664)|
| 4:04:38| Hi, I'm Peggy Coley, and I live at 2504 Mont Glenn Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14678)|
| 4:04:46| Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to represent the Free Medical Clinic on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14686)|
| 4:04:53| I'm here to answer the question, how does the Free Medical Clinic benefit the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14693)|
| 4:04:58| Our clinic saves the community in emergency room care and costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14698)|
| 4:05:06| When those individuals who are uninsured have to go to the emergency room for treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14706)|
| 4:05:10| the cost of their care is usually uncollectable and must be written off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14710)|
| 4:05:15| A New York Times article on December 9th of 2008 states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14715)|
| 4:05:20| the unemployed and uninsured are turning to the nation's emergency rooms as a medical last resort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14720)|
| 4:05:26| Emergency rooms are legally obliged to see all patients regardless of their ability to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14726)|
| 4:05:33| Hospitals are absorbing increasing amounts of unpaid medical bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14733)|
| 4:05:37| When individuals come to the Free Medical Clinic instead of to the emergency room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14737)|
| 4:05:41| the local avoided costs are estimated at $8 million for the life of the Free Medical Clinic and are growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14741)|
| 4:05:49| Yesterday, a man was told by a local clinic that he would have to wait until the end of June to be seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14749)|
| 4:05:56| Instead of going to the emergency room, he came to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14756)|
| 4:06:00| was treated by Dr. Kim for an ear infection and was on his way back to work in about 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14760)|
| 4:06:06| We operate on a lean budget and there are no frills attached to our treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14766)|
| 4:06:12| But since it opened, the Free Medical Clinic has delivered about $2.7 million of medical care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14772)|
| 4:06:19| at a cost of less than $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14779)|
| 4:06:23| The cost per patient visit is about $41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14783)|
| 4:06:27| This means for every dollar spent by the clinic, $4.50 in medical care was delivered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14787)|
| 4:06:33| Every dollar invested in the clinic through a community grant returns $4.50 in value to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14793)|
| 4:06:42| The Free Medical Clinic works closely with other health care providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14802)|
| 4:06:46| who serve the estimated 55,000 uninsured in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14806)|
| 4:06:51| Yesterday's New Sentinel states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14811)|
| 4:06:54| through a network of doctors and health systems that volunteer to help him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14814)|
| 4:06:59| Dr. Kim agreed, excuse me, Dr. Kim arranged for Kimberly Gaines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14819)|
| 4:07:04| who had found a lump in her breast, to see an oncologist and have tests done at Baptist Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14824)|
| 4:07:11| Kimberly stated, Free Medical Clinic, I know had you not been there, I would not be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14831)|
| 4:07:19| As a primary care clinic, we have treated 6,400 uninsured individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14839)|
| 4:07:25| and more than 2,800 have made the Free Medical Clinic their regular medical home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14845)|
| 4:07:32| Finally, your investment in our clinic helps us to get men and women back to work quicker when an illness strikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14852)|
| 4:07:39| As one of our patients, Gene Sims, explained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14859)|
| 4:07:43| my experience with the Free Medical Clinic of America was very humbling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14863)|
| 4:07:48| I am much better thanks to Dr. Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14868)|
| 4:07:51| After his referral to the CAPA program and my successful surgery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14871)|
| 4:07:57| I can get back to work and lead a normal life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14877)|
| 4:08:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14881)|
| 4:08:03| Thank you. Do we have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14883)|
| 4:08:06| Thank you for what you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14886)|
| 4:08:07| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14887)|
| 4:08:10| Next, we have Ben Harrington, Mental Health Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14890)|
| 4:08:20| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14900)|
| 4:08:21| Yes, sir. Ben Harrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14901)|
| 4:08:23| I live at 10126 Longford Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14903)|
| 4:08:26| That's 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14906)|
| 4:08:29| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14909)|
| 4:08:30| I'm the Mental Health Association of East Tennessee Executive Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14910)|
| 4:08:33| and I'm here to talk a little bit about mental health in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14913)|
| 4:08:37| but also more particularly about something called Mental Health 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14917)|
| 4:08:41| Why do we do Mental Health 101 in the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14921)|
| 4:08:45| It's pretty simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14925)|
| 4:08:46| 26.2% of our population has a mental health treatment need in this calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14926)|
| 4:08:53| If there's still about 80 to 100 people behind me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14933)|
| 4:08:56| that means about 20 folks in the room need mental health care right now in this calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14936)|
| 4:09:04| Some of them would think that there would be more upstage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14944)|
| 4:09:08| You know, I say that every year when I come up here, and it always gets the same type of chuckles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14948)|
| 4:09:13| But the facts you need to understand are that most folks who do develop a mental illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14953)|
| 4:09:21| their symptoms start by age 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14961)|
| 4:09:23| 50% of folks who have a mental illness have their symptoms start by age 15, 75% by age 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14963)|
| 4:09:30| Now, the scariest thing is that most people experience what's called treatment delay of 10 to 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14970)|
| 4:09:37| Their symptoms start, and then nothing happens for 12 or more years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14977)|
| 4:09:43| That means folks get sicker and sicker and sicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14983)|
| 4:09:47| So we have a choice to go down two roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14987)|
| 4:09:50| One, the first road is to do nothing, and people are going to get very sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14990)|
| 4:09:54| going to get impaired, if not psychiatrically disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14994)|
| 4:09:59| That is not acceptable to the board of the Mental Health Association, nor to the staff, nor to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=14999)|
| 4:10:05| The other road is a much better road to go down, and that is the road of prevention and intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15005)|
| 4:10:10| And that's why we do Mental Health 101 in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15010)|
| 4:10:14| We built this program starting in 2000 at Gibbs High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15014)|
| 4:10:18| and to this date it has expanded to a total of 53 schools in 22 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15018)|
| 4:10:23| Twenty-one of the schools are in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15023)|
| 4:10:26| A year ago, the allocation panel recommended that our program be funded to expand the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15026)|
| 4:10:33| and build that program not just in high schools, but also build it at the middle school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15033)|
| 4:10:38| So we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15038)|
| 4:10:39| We expanded to eight middle schools in this fiscal year that we're currently in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15039)|
| 4:10:45| Knox County High School likes that so much, they said to us again this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15045)|
| 4:10:49| please keep the expansion going, so we asked for the funding to expand the program further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15049)|
| 4:10:55| There are a total of 14 middle schools, and currently six are unserved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15055)|
| 4:10:58| and our intention this year is to continue growing the program to the remaining middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15058)|
| 4:11:04| So it's incredibly important that we do that, and let me tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15064)|
| 4:11:08| Sometimes folks ask about what's the return on investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15068)|
| 4:11:12| If a young person attempts suicide and is admitted to the UT Emergency Room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15072)|
| 4:11:17| their admission, if they are kept overnight, will cost $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15077)|
| 4:11:24| The total budget request of Knox County government is $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15084)|
| 4:11:30| So if we can prevent two kids from attempting suicide and being placed in the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15090)|
| 4:11:36| then we've broken even for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15096)|
| 4:11:39| But let me tell you what's really going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15099)|
| 4:11:41| We have been so successful at helping kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15101)|
| 4:11:45| the number of kids or percent of students that have contemplated suicide has fallen by 31%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15105)|
| 4:11:51| The percent of kids that have planned a suicide has fallen by 30%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15111)|
| 4:11:55| and the percent of students that have attempted suicide has fallen by 67.57%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15115)|
| 4:12:01| Tremendously important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15121)|
| 4:12:03| This shows the return on the investment is incredible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15123)|
| 4:12:07| and we appreciate your support of the Mental Health Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15127)|
| 4:12:10| and particularly the support of our work with students in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15130)|
| 4:12:16| I'd be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15136)|
| 4:12:18| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15138)|
| 4:12:21| Thank you for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15141)|
| 4:12:22| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15142)|
| 4:12:26| Next we have Bruce Van Cleve, Boy Scouts of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15146)|
| 4:12:39| Is Bruce here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15159)|
| 4:12:41| Not here, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15161)|
| 4:12:43| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15163)|
| 4:12:45| Sam Maynard, James White Fort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15165)|
| 4:12:50| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15170)|
| 4:12:55| Sam Maynard, 3311 Gillenwater Road, Knoxville, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15175)|
| 4:13:03| Being Director, James White Fort is a real feat these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15183)|
| 4:13:07| It's Knoxville's first home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15187)|
| 4:13:08| We do appreciate the money that we did get this year being left out of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15188)|
| 4:13:12| but we continue to survive at the fort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15192)|
| 4:13:15| We just want to appreciate all the interesting things we've got going on all year long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15195)|
| 4:13:21| Some of you have been participating at the fort also and stopping by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15201)|
| 4:13:26| I see some smiling faces of some of you commissioners that have been by there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15206)|
| 4:13:30| We just want to reiterate once again on what we do for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15210)|
| 4:13:35| We have a tremendous amount of school groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15215)|
| 4:13:38| This month really ends up about our county schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15218)|
| 4:13:43| We do have private schools coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15223)|
| 4:13:45| We also do share with Blount Mansion with school groups that come back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15225)|
| 4:13:51| It's been actually today and have lunch usually in the courtyard at the fort also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15231)|
| 4:13:57| Also, we have tourists that come in from all over the country and all over the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15237)|
| 4:14:01| We do have a roster for that purpose of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15241)|
| 4:14:03| These people are good, quality people that come into Knoxville that actually spends money in hotels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15243)|
| 4:14:11| our shops, other historical structures, museums, that actually does keep our tax base down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15251)|
| 4:14:18| So we do recognize that and also appreciate Gloria Ray and what she's done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15258)|
| 4:14:23| and also Lisa with the Arts and Cultural Alliance that also with all the arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15263)|
| 4:14:27| Without the arts, the museums, historical structures, and all what we do have in our events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15267)|
| 4:14:33| we would not have a Knoxville to come to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15273)|
| 4:14:35| But we want to thank you for what you all have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15275)|
| 4:14:38| and participated in with giving us funding this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15278)|
| 4:14:42| And thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15282)|
| 4:14:43| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15283)|
| 4:14:48| Sam, David Collins was doing, several years ago, he was doing a thing for another building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15288)|
| 4:14:52| Is that, are you all still wanting to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15292)|
| 4:14:54| Is that gone away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15294)|
| 4:14:56| That's not anything we need to do right now with the way funding is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15296)|
| 4:15:02| That was more or less a, that was before even I got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15302)|
| 4:15:07| That was a building for, with proper restrooms, also an assembly area to come into for the children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15307)|
| 4:15:17| because we really don't have an assembly area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15317)|
| 4:15:19| We just have to put them in a courtyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15319)|
| 4:15:20| If it rains, we just have to do the best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15320)|
| 4:15:23| So that sort of was scrapped before I got there six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15323)|
| 4:15:27| But we just have to look for that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15327)|
| 4:15:30| But the fundings are just not going to be there for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15330)|
| 4:15:32| But you'll eventually get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15332)|
| 4:15:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15334)|
| 4:15:35| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15335)|
| 4:15:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15337)|
| 4:15:38| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15338)|
| 4:15:41| Bob Sexton, Cerebral Palsy Housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15341)|
| 4:15:55| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15355)|
| 4:15:56| I'm Bob Sexton, 5333 Beverly Oaks Drive, Knoxville, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15356)|
| 4:16:02| I appreciate the opportunity to be with you this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15362)|
| 4:16:05| I just want to give you a little bit of background and history about the Cerebral Palsy Housing Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15365)|
| 4:16:10| and ask for your assistance this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15370)|
| 4:16:13| You know, 29 years ago at the Cerebral Palsy Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15373)|
| 4:16:19| staff and members of the board of directors noticed that young adults with cerebral palsy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15379)|
| 4:16:26| had no other alternative as to a place to live when their family became unable to care for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15386)|
| 4:16:34| or their family passed away other than nursing homes and boarding homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15394)|
| 4:16:39| And so in the programs that the Cerebral Palsy Center offered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15399)|
| 4:16:43| the staff and the board of directors were very sad to see young adults having to move into nursing homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15403)|
| 4:16:50| and spend their entire life separated from the community, being institutionalized prematurely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15410)|
| 4:16:57| They were very saddened to see the conditions of abuse, exploitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15417)|
| 4:17:01| and mistreatment that occurred many times in boarding homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15421)|
| 4:17:05| And so they made the decision to develop housing for individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15425)|
| 4:17:09| who did not have a diagnosis of mental retardation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15429)|
| 4:17:13| but who had a physical disability that prevented them from accessing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15433)|
| 4:17:18| some of the existing funded programs in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15438)|
| 4:17:22| You know, the state of Tennessee has a huge gap in working with individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15442)|
| 4:17:26| who do not have mental retardation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15446)|
| 4:17:29| The state of Tennessee utilizes a Medicaid waiver, a home-based community Medicaid waiver,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15449)|
| 4:17:37| that one has to have a diagnosis of mental retardation to access it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15457)|
| 4:17:42| The state of Tennessee does not have a personal assistance care program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15462)|
| 4:17:46| and so individuals with cerebral palsy who do not have mental retardation, which 60% do not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15466)|
| 4:17:52| or people with autism who do not have mental retardation or spina bifida or epilepsy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15472)|
| 4:17:57| or some of the other developmental disabilities absolutely have no opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15477)|
| 4:18:02| to live in our society and in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15482)|
| 4:18:05| And so, as I say, we were very saddened to see that such people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15485)|
| 4:18:09| had to go to nursing homes and to boarding homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15489)|
| 4:18:11| So we developed housing for them back then 29 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15491)|
| 4:18:15| And Knox County, along with the city and United Way and churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15495)|
| 4:18:19| and civic organizations were our partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15499)|
| 4:18:22| But to do such a thing through not having dedicated state funds was a real risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15502)|
| 4:18:29| and a real stepping out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15509)|
| 4:18:31| How can we do this in our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15511)|
| 4:18:34| And it was only because everyone stepped up and said, we'll do our small part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15514)|
| 4:18:39| And I will be frank with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15519)|
| 4:18:41| Through the many years, Akema Club and churches and Sertama Clubs and Rotary Clubs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15521)|
| 4:18:47| have done their part, and United Way and individual companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15527)|
| 4:18:50| but Knox County has not been a dependable partner, even though they said they would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15530)|
| 4:18:55| Even though Dwight Kessel said and Tommy Shumpert said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15535)|
| 4:18:58| and they kept their word that they would help a little bit to keep this going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15538)|
| 4:19:03| because in any other community you go to in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15543)|
| 4:19:07| young people with physical disabilities who do not have mental retardation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15547)|
| 4:19:11| are in nursing homes and boarding homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15551)|
| 4:19:13| And Knoxville should be proud that it cared enough to develop an alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15553)|
| 4:19:17| where people could be cared for and remain an active part of their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15557)|
| 4:19:22| And so for the last three years, except last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15562)|
| 4:19:26| Knox County has given no community agency grant money to this corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15566)|
| 4:19:30| Last year, through the citizen review process, funding was reinstated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15570)|
| 4:19:34| But this year, because of the lack of funds, which I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15574)|
| 4:19:38| there's a recommendation for zero funds again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15578)|
| 4:19:41| So the question is, you know, what does this community want to do with these individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15581)|
| 4:19:46| have nowhere else to go to live and do not qualify for state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15586)|
| 4:19:50| and other Medicaid federal and state funds that are available for people with mental retardation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15590)|
| 4:19:55| Are we going to be a community that shows our caring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15595)|
| 4:19:58| and includes such people in the fabric of our society?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15598)|
| 4:20:01| Are we going to be a community that places such people in nursing homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15601)|
| 4:20:05| or allows them to be exploited or mistreated in boarding homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15605)|
| 4:20:08| And that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15608)|
| 4:20:09| I'm just asking today if you cannot find some small way to help just a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15609)|
| 4:20:14| as you had in the past until these last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15614)|
| 4:20:19| How much was your request for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15619)|
| 4:20:21| Our request was for $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15621)|
| 4:20:25| Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15625)|
| 4:20:28| Yeah, $10,000 does not seem an unreasonable amount to ask for considering the work that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15628)|
| 4:20:38| And I'll say I believe that the folks in the age group that you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15638)|
| 4:20:43| would be far better off in something other than a nursing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15643)|
| 4:20:48| They don't need that level of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15648)|
| 4:20:50| I, for one, would support commission adding that $10,000 back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15650)|
| 4:20:56| I'm not sure if anyone else here would back me up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15656)|
| 4:20:59| But if none others want to, I'd like to add that $10,000 back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15659)|
| 4:21:09| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15669)|
| 4:21:10| We'll see what we can do for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15670)|
| 4:21:12| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15672)|
| 4:21:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15673)|
| 4:21:17| Are there two, Mr. Chairman, are there two cerebral palsy line items here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15677)|
| 4:21:21| I see one for $12,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15681)|
| 4:21:23| There are two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15683)|
| 4:21:24| There's one for Cerebral Palsy Center for Handicapped Adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15684)|
| 4:21:28| and one for the Housing Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15688)|
| 4:21:30| The $12,500 is in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15690)|
| 4:21:32| That was for the Center for Handicapped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15692)|
| 4:21:34| It had nothing to do with the housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15694)|
| 4:21:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15696)|
| 4:21:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15697)|
| 4:21:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15698)|
| 4:21:39| We have Thomas Duncan, East Tennessee Television and Film Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15699)|
| 4:21:49| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15709)|
| 4:21:54| Thomas Duncan, 1549 Coleman Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15714)|
| 4:21:59| Good afternoon, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15719)|
| 4:22:00| I'd like to thank you for this opportunity to come before you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15720)|
| 4:22:03| on behalf of the East Tennessee Television and Film Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15723)|
| 4:22:06| The East Tennessee Television and Film Commission is a 501C3 economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15726)|
| 4:22:12| nonprofit organization, which acts as the central coordinating entity for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15732)|
| 4:22:16| recruiting and supporting film, television, music,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15736)|
| 4:22:20| and interactive media production within the East Tennessee region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15740)|
| 4:22:24| Included in that mission is the coordination of activities involving governmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15744)|
| 4:22:28| agencies and the local business community on behalf of local, national,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15748)|
| 4:22:32| and international production companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15752)|
| 4:22:35| As you can tell from this description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15755)|
| 4:22:37| the East Tennessee Television and Film Commission doesn't fit very neatly into any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15757)|
| 4:22:41| of the five programs or project categories afforded it in the county's grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15761)|
| 4:22:45| application paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15765)|
| 4:22:47| Nevertheless, I come before you today to ask that you reconsider the ETTFC's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15767)|
| 4:22:51| two programs for funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15771)|
| 4:22:53| The first is our production recruitment program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15773)|
| 4:22:56| With an average annual budget of less than $100,000 per year over the last four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15776)|
| 4:23:01| years, the East Tennessee Television and Film Commission has recruited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15781)|
| 4:23:04| and supported film and television productions from outside our region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15784)|
| 4:23:09| that have brought close to $16 million into the Knox County area economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15789)|
| 4:23:14| a return of investment on 40 to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15794)|
| 4:23:18| When an external production company considers shooting in our region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15798)|
| 4:23:22| it's the responsibility of the ETTFC to promote the local workforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15802)|
| 4:23:26| provide detailed information and photographs of potential venues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15806)|
| 4:23:30| foster the utilization of local businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15810)|
| 4:23:33| and industry support of the production,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15813)|
| 4:23:36| and generally advance the notion that East Tennessee has a tremendous amount to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15816)|
| 4:23:39| offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15819)|
| 4:23:42| Once a production elects to come to our area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15822)|
| 4:23:45| the ETTFC switches into facilitation mode and supports the acquisition of permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15825)|
| 4:23:52| office space, location scouting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15832)|
| 4:23:54| and many other efforts on behalf of day-to-day production.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15834)|
| 4:23:58| The state of Tennessee has recognized the economical benefits enjoyed by other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15838)|
| 4:24:02| states with a strong production industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15842)|
| 4:24:05| and as a result have passed film incentives to aid in the recruitment of film| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15845)|
| 4:24:08| and television projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15848)|
| 4:24:10| allowing for both local and out-of-state productions to receive up to 32% of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15850)|
| 4:24:14| their in-state spend back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15854)|
| 4:24:18| If the ETTFC closes, Knox County will lose the opportunity to capitalize on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15858)|
| 4:24:22| these incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15862)|
| 4:24:24| Since the passage of these incentives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15864)|
| 4:24:26| Knoxville has seen a significant increase in the development of production of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15866)|
| 4:24:30| theatrical films.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15870)|
| 4:24:32| One such film is That Evening Sun, produced by Double J Creative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15872)|
| 4:24:36| which is already being held as a possible Oscar film.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15876)|
| 4:24:41| Your support of the ETTFC production recruitment program will enable our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15881)|
| 4:24:45| organization to continue its recruitment and marketing efforts on behalf of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15885)|
| 4:24:49| Knox County to production companies from around the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15889)|
| 4:24:53| This active recruitment process will create more jobs and benefit businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15893)|
| 4:24:56| throughout our community, including those in the hospitality, catering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15896)|
| 4:25:00| clerical, real estate, construction, retail, and rental industries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15900)|
| 4:25:05| Clearly, given the economic climate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15905)|
| 4:25:07| supporting programs which encourage and increase employment in our community is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15907)|
| 4:25:11| a worthwhile, even critical endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15911)|
| 4:25:14| The second program for which we are requesting your support is our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15914)|
| 4:25:17| industry growth program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15917)|
| 4:25:19| You may or may not be aware that Knox County's local television and film| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15919)|
| 4:25:22| companies generate annual operating revenues of $1.6 billion and provide jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15922)|
| 4:25:29| for more than 3,800 employees locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15929)|
| 4:25:32| With your funding support, the ETTFC will continue its program to support the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15932)|
| 4:25:37| growth and stability of the local production community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15937)|
| 4:25:40| Through our industry growth initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15940)|
| 4:25:42| the ETTFC will continue to provide aid to local companies and individuals in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15942)|
| 4:25:46| development of projects and programs, provide location support, permitting services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15946)|
| 4:25:53| crew referrals, equipment acquisition, and networking opportunities, assist local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15953)|
| 4:25:58| companies in securing additional distribution avenues for expansion into markets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15958)|
| 4:26:02| outside of the United States, conduct workshops offering exposure to new technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15962)|
| 4:26:08| and training for our existing and future workforce, and follow up on the success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15968)|
| 4:26:13| of initiating an agreement between Pellissippi State and the University of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15973)|
| 4:26:17| Tennessee to upgrade their respective academic and technical programs with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15977)|
| 4:26:21| ultimate goal of retaining a qualified workforce in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15981)|
| 4:26:25| Through this program, the ETTFC will sustain and grow an industry that contributes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15985)|
| 4:26:29| an estimated $800 million into our community, resulting in more jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15989)|
| 4:26:34| and revenue for the local economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15994)|
| 4:26:36| I'm going to have to cut you off there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15996)|
| 4:26:38| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15998)|
| 4:26:39| I gave you a couple minutes extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=15999)|
| 4:26:41| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16001)|
| 4:26:44| You know, I believe that in a community this size, and especially with all that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16004)|
| 4:26:49| community has to offer, that we need a film and television commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16009)|
| 4:26:54| You know, I really don't think it's a good idea to defund this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16014)|
| 4:27:01| Television, especially, is one of the fastest growing industries in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16021)|
| 4:27:07| We're in the middle of a recession, and times are tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16027)|
| 4:27:11| Well, one thing that we can do in East Tennessee, cheaper than anybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16031)|
| 4:27:15| is produce television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16035)|
| 4:27:17| That's why River Media and Scripps and, you know, some of the various smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16037)|
| 4:27:23| production houses are located here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16043)|
| 4:27:26| We have the education base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16046)|
| 4:27:28| We have UT and Pellissippi State turning out qualified technicians to work in this industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16048)|
| 4:27:36| You know, we're a right-to-work state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16056)|
| 4:27:39| In this area, you can have union and non-union folks working side-by-side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16059)|
| 4:27:46| Because of this, I think that we have a huge industry that we can build here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16066)|
| 4:27:52| We've got a pretty good-sized television industry here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16072)|
| 4:27:56| I think that it can be taken to the next level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16076)|
| 4:27:59| I think it's a horrible idea to defund the film and television commission at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16079)|
| 4:28:04| Now, I do believe that the film and television commission, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16084)|
| 4:28:09| they need some money to do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16089)|
| 4:28:13| It costs money to have a professional film commissioner in an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16093)|
| 4:28:19| It costs money to be able to travel and recruit folks to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16099)|
| 4:28:25| It costs money to be able to do location scouting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16105)|
| 4:28:28| and go out and take pictures and show folks, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16108)|
| 4:28:32| the wonderful areas that we have to shoot in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16112)|
| 4:28:35| And I think that last year's level of funding, I'll be honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16115)|
| 4:28:39| I don't think we got a lot last year, but I don't think we paid a lot last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16119)|
| 4:28:44| I think that this needs to be funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16124)|
| 4:28:46| and I don't believe it needs to be funded through a community grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16126)|
| 4:28:51| I don't believe it needs to be funded as a contract for services in some areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16131)|
| 4:28:57| The film commission and the television commission are funded as a part of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16137)|
| 4:29:03| They are a government agency in some areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16143)|
| 4:29:06| I think that the film and television commission competing for grant money, it's just not a fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16146)|
| 4:29:15| They're not a charity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16155)|
| 4:29:18| They're more like the chamber or more like the tourism and sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16158)|
| 4:29:23| Now, I'd also like to see the film and television commission be energized a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16163)|
| 4:29:29| and I see on both sides of the room we have two of our most energetic folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16169)|
| 4:29:35| with two of our most energetic organizations right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16175)|
| 4:29:38| We have Gloria Ray with Tourism and Sports Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16178)|
| 4:29:42| similar type recruiting to what film and television commission would be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16182)|
| 4:29:46| I see we have Mike Edwards with the Chamber Partnership, similar type business recruiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16186)|
| 4:29:55| I think that we need to fund the film and television commission at a much heavier level than we did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16195)|
| 4:30:02| I think we need to go back to the previous year's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16202)|
| 4:30:07| but I also think that we need to put this organization under the umbrella| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16207)|
| 4:30:13| with some serious oversight of one of these two folks, and I'm not sure which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16213)|
| 4:30:17| and they both have expressed a willingness to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16217)|
| 4:30:21| But I think that it would be a mistake in a struggling economy that we take the one industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16221)|
| 4:30:27| that we could do some serious recruiting in and that we could seriously grow to the next level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16227)|
| 4:30:33| I think that it would be a mistake for us to quit funding this at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16233)|
| 4:30:39| In fact, I think we need to increase their funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16239)|
| 4:30:42| but at the same time I also think we need to give them a little more oversight from one of the two organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16242)|
| 4:30:50| either the Chamber of Tourism and Sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16250)|
| 4:30:52| who has proven themselves capable time and time again at doing similar missions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16252)|
| 4:30:57| So probably when it comes time to proposing budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16257)|
| 4:31:01| I'm probably going to propose that we get this level back to $100,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16261)|
| 4:31:07| but that we run it through one of these other two organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16267)|
| 4:31:11| and make one of those organizations a parent organization for the Film and Television Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16271)|
| 4:31:17| Another thing I'd like to see is I'd like to see the Film and Television Commission do some private fundraising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16277)|
| 4:31:24| We have industries here that benefit greatly from having film and television being produced here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16284)|
| 4:31:31| Some very generous folks I know that run these businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16291)|
| 4:31:35| I'm not going to pick on anybody personally, but we have various lighting entities that rent lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16295)|
| 4:31:41| We have entities that rent production equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16301)|
| 4:31:44| I think that the time has come in this tough economy that they step up and make some private contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16304)|
| 4:31:50| that I'm not even sure if they've ever been asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16310)|
| 4:31:53| But I do believe that the Film and Television Commission can do great things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16313)|
| 4:31:59| but I think that they need some funding and I think they need some oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16319)|
| 4:32:04| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16324)|
| 4:32:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16325)|
| 4:32:06| What's your total budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16326)|
| 4:32:08| This year or in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16328)|
| 4:32:09| In the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16329)|
| 4:32:11| Or this current year that we're talking about funding next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16331)|
| 4:32:14| What are you at this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16334)|
| 4:32:15| This year we are at $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16335)|
| 4:32:17| Last year's though, what was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16337)|
| 4:32:19| The year before we were at $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16339)|
| 4:32:21| And it's all come from Knox County Government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16341)|
| 4:32:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16343)|
| 4:32:25| And you're doing East Tennessee Film Commission as your title,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16345)|
| 4:32:29| but all your funding is coming from Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16349)|
| 4:32:31| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16351)|
| 4:32:33| Have you asked anybody else for any money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16353)|
| 4:32:35| When the organization was first founded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16355)|
| 4:32:38| it was funded by a group in the East Tennessee area that included Sevier, Rome, Oak Ridge, Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16358)|
| 4:32:49| When I came on, the funding was down to just Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16369)|
| 4:32:54| Have we applied for any funds in the last two years to any other county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16374)|
| 4:32:59| We have gone back to the surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16379)|
| 4:33:02| Last year we were being funded by Oak Ridge also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16382)|
| 4:33:07| We have lost that funding for this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16387)|
| 4:33:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16391)|
| 4:33:12| How many full-time people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16392)|
| 4:33:13| You got just one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16393)|
| 4:33:14| Me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16394)|
| 4:33:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16395)|
| 4:33:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16397)|
| 4:33:18| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16398)|
| 4:33:19| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16399)|
| 4:33:20| Calvin Chappell, Hazen Historical Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16400)|
| 4:33:32| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16412)|
| 4:33:33| Calvin Chappell, 1649 Dandridge Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16413)|
| 4:33:40| If you notice, our business address is 1711 Dandridge, so I actually live at work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16420)|
| 4:33:44| I am the one full-time employee at the establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16424)|
| 4:33:48| We oversee both the Mabry Hazen House Museum and the Bethel Civil War Cemetery down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16428)|
| 4:33:53| The funding proposal is for the Bethel Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16433)|
| 4:33:57| There is a cottage there that was built in 1886.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16437)|
| 4:33:59| We hope to establish a museum there to assist in our fundraising efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16439)|
| 4:34:05| We fully understand that this proposed funding is an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16445)|
| 4:34:10| It is not an ongoing and reoccurring privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16450)|
| 4:34:13| Accounting funding that we have received in the past has always been used for capital improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16453)|
| 4:34:17| These capital improvements assist our foundation in becoming a more self-sustainable organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16457)|
| 4:34:22| The capital improvements have increased our attendance for our special events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16462)|
| 4:34:26| and have made our fundraising efforts much more feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16466)|
| 4:34:29| The funding for the current proposed project is no different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16469)|
| 4:34:32| The establishment of the Bethel Cemetery Museum will not only allow us to raise more funds for our foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16472)|
| 4:34:38| but also increase the visibility of our site through Civil War enthusiasts, genealogists, and the local community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16478)|
| 4:34:44| We understand that all nonprofits in the area are in need of funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16484)|
| 4:34:47| and I commend you and your hard work, especially considering the hard economic times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16487)|
| 4:34:52| Thank you. I'll open the floor for any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16492)|
| 4:35:00| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16500)|
| 4:35:03| Good luck, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16503)|
| 4:35:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16504)|
| 4:35:07| Jenny Weatherstone, Volunteer Ministry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16507)|
| 4:35:11| I don't believe she's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16511)|
| 4:35:13| Commissioner Burroughs, you said you wanted to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16513)|
| 4:35:16| Yeah, Jenny is still cleaning up from the Carry the Torch event that several of us went to and enjoyed tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16516)|
| 4:35:27| VMC, as part of the 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16527)|
| 4:35:31| VMC's role in that is to provide case management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16531)|
| 4:35:35| which is really the crucial piece of the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16535)|
| 4:35:39| We can't put people into permanent supportive housing unless they have case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16539)|
| 4:35:44| Each case manager has a caseload of 20 to 25 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16544)|
| 4:35:50| Right now, VMC has a waiting list of over 100 people for case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16550)|
| 4:35:56| These are people who are chronically homeless, who want to get off the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16556)|
| 4:36:00| who want to be in the program, and who want to get a place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16560)|
| 4:36:08| Cutting their funding right now I think would be a serious mistake for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16568)|
| 4:36:13| as we try to move forward with the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16573)|
| 4:36:17| As an example, I can tell you a client of theirs that I met last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16577)|
| 4:36:21| who had been on the streets for 43 years since he was 13 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16581)|
| 4:36:28| was usually arrested around five times a month for public intoxication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16588)|
| 4:36:36| And each arrest costs the county, I believe they average it out to be about $800 per arrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16596)|
| 4:36:45| He came to VMC and agreed to enter their program about two months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16605)|
| 4:36:54| He hasn't had any arrests in those two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16614)|
| 4:36:57| He goes to VMC every day and does his volunteer opportunities and attends his classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16617)|
| 4:37:03| It's been about two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16623)|
| 4:37:05| He's got about another two months to go until he can get actually into his apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16625)|
| 4:37:10| So this is a four-month process for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16630)|
| 4:37:13| It takes a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16633)|
| 4:37:15| So if you take those two months, that's quite a bit of money that we've saved just right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16635)|
| 4:37:22| on not having him arrested five times a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16642)|
| 4:37:25| So that's about $8,000 savings right there keeping him out of trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16645)|
| 4:37:32| And each case manager costs about $50,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16652)|
| 4:37:37| And like I said, they can handle a caseload of up to about 25 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16657)|
| 4:37:43| So really we need another at least five case managers just to deal with the waiting list that we have at VMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16663)|
| 4:37:52| And the funding is just not there for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16672)|
| 4:37:55| But this is something that if we're going to do the tenure plan, we need to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16675)|
| 4:38:01| And case management is the key to making it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16681)|
| 4:38:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16686)|
| 4:38:09| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16689)|
| 4:38:11| Not to necessarily echo what Amy had to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16691)|
| 4:38:15| but I've had the occasion to be out there at Volunteer Ministries three different times in the last six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16695)|
| 4:38:24| And I would like to say that I am so impressed by the attitude of the people in the program out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16704)|
| 4:38:35| It's like one big family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16715)|
| 4:38:38| They feel like they do belong now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16718)|
| 4:38:40| They have something that is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16720)|
| 4:38:43| And as Amy mentioned, if we're going to go headlong, feet first, whatever, into this tenure plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16723)|
| 4:38:51| we're going to have to have some way of managing these folks once they get in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16731)|
| 4:38:56| That's the only way that the citizens, including myself, are going to feel safe having them in our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16736)|
| 4:39:04| I mean, it's just a matter of, you know, you've got to call a spade a spade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16744)|
| 4:39:08| If you've got people who have certain backgrounds, you're leery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16748)|
| 4:39:14| But with the proper case managers, I think that some of these can be helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16754)|
| 4:39:22| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16762)|
| 4:39:24| Okay, moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16764)|
| 4:39:26| We have Dr. Mitchell Goldman, University of Health Systems Medical Explorations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16766)|
| 4:39:33| Mr. Chairman, before he starts, Commissioner Caringen and I have to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16773)|
| 4:39:36| We have a 430 commissioners day out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16776)|
| 4:39:39| We've had it advertised for over a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16779)|
| 4:39:41| So can you sort of tell us how long you think you'll go today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16781)|
| 4:39:44| Are you going to discuss more of the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16784)|
| 4:39:45| What are the plans from here forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16785)|
| 4:39:48| Well, we're not really sticking to our two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16788)|
| 4:39:51| And the speakers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16791)|
| 4:39:54| We're adding to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16794)|
| 4:39:57| Well, he's number 17, and we've got about another 11 or 12 more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16797)|
| 4:40:07| And then we're going to allow anybody in the audience here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16807)|
| 4:40:12| Are we going to get together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16812)|
| 4:40:13| And then we're going to, after that, we've got where we're just going to, it's opened up to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16813)|
| 4:40:19| we can talk about anything about the budget, so however long that lasts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16819)|
| 4:40:24| So at the rate we're going, we probably have a good 45 minutes of just getting through the community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16824)|
| 4:40:31| Are you going to try to finish this whole program today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16831)|
| 4:40:35| We're going to try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16835)|
| 4:40:37| So, I mean, it could be 9, 10 o'clock tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16837)|
| 4:40:39| It depends on how much the commission wants to talk about the budget today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16839)|
| 4:40:47| Are you going to take a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16847)|
| 4:40:48| We need to at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16848)|
| 4:40:50| Well, we can't vote today now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16850)|
| 4:40:52| If commissioners don't wish to, you know, when we get through the community grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16852)|
| 4:40:58| and the commissioners don't feel like discussing it and want to set up another day to discuss the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16858)|
| 4:41:06| then we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16866)|
| 4:41:09| So, in fact, I'm sorry, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16869)|
| 4:41:13| You're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16873)|
| 4:41:14| I'll be brief too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16874)|
| 4:41:15| And it's my thought that instead of actually voting on the budget this month at our regular monthly meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16875)|
| 4:41:28| I think it would be a wise thing to do is to have a special call meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16888)|
| 4:41:33| to take any action on those items that deal with the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16893)|
| 4:41:40| and have a special meeting on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16900)|
| 4:41:43| because we already spend a lot of time at a regular meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16903)|
| 4:41:45| let alone trying to add the budget and the tax rate, capital plan, everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16905)|
| 4:41:51| So it might be, I thought, that might even be part of what we discuss once we get through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16911)|
| 4:41:57| is trying to figure out when do we really want to try to take action on the budget where we can vote at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16917)|
| 4:42:05| And that would have to be at a special call meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16925)|
| 4:42:07| not just a hearing where we can't take a vote today on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16927)|
| 4:42:11| We just want to let you know we have to step back because we had something we planned over a month ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16931)|
| 4:42:15| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16935)|
| 4:42:16| Our apologies to the rest of the people that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16936)|
| 4:42:18| But go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16938)|
| 4:42:19| We've got some more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16939)|
| 4:42:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16940)|
| 4:42:21| Very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16941)|
| 4:42:22| My name is Mitchell H. Goldman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16942)|
| 4:42:23| I live at 5300 Riverbrier Road, Knoxville, 37919 Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16943)|
| 4:42:29| I'm here to talk about medical explorations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16949)|
| 4:42:31| I talked to you last year as well about it, and we were funded last year, not this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16951)|
| 4:42:36| Medical Explorations is a program hopefully down the road will alleviate the shortage of physician personnel in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16956)|
| 4:42:45| as you all have read over the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16965)|
| 4:42:48| We have a shortfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16968)|
| 4:42:50| There are five new allopathic medical schools and a number of new osteopathic medical schools being developed to meet that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16970)|
| 4:42:56| I'm an educator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16976)|
| 4:42:58| I teach residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16978)|
| 4:42:59| I teach medical students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16979)|
| 4:43:00| I mentor college students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16980)|
| 4:43:02| This program is about high school students to enable them to look into medical careers over a six-week intensive study period during the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16982)|
| 4:43:12| The request for money, since the 45 physicians volunteer their time, I volunteer my time, my secretary volunteers her time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16992)|
| 4:43:19| the request for money is for stipends for the students so that we do not attract only the people who can spend six weeks out of their summer in a course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16999)|
| 4:43:31| It's to make sure they have some support so that they don't have to work at another job so we can attract underprivileged folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17011)|
| 4:43:41| people with limited resources, to enter into the medical professions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17021)|
| 4:43:46| Not only physicians, we have nursing, physical therapy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17026)|
| 4:43:49| and other health-related professions that we introduce them to in a very intensive course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17029)|
| 4:43:57| That's all I'll say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17037)|
| 4:43:59| I will take any money you will give me because I spend three months out of the year stomping, picking up bits and pieces of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17039)|
| 4:44:07| This year we had a new donor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17047)|
| 4:44:09| We got $600 from a grateful patient to fund a scholarship for one student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17049)|
| 4:44:14| Each student gets $600 for the six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17054)|
| 4:44:17| The physicians, I personally contribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17057)|
| 4:44:20| Physicians contribute both time and money, and I have to get up to somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17060)|
| 4:44:25| depending on how much I get, how many students I'm allowed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17065)|
| 4:44:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17069)|
| 4:44:31| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17071)|
| 4:44:33| I'd just like to say a few words about the Medical Explorers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17073)|
| 4:44:37| and let me just say my husband nor my daughter benefit from this program at the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17077)|
| 4:44:46| but I am very well acquainted with Dr. Goldman and this project that he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17086)|
| 4:44:53| As he said, we are in a big shortage of doctors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17093)|
| 4:44:58| That was in this weekend's paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17098)|
| 4:44:59| It's been all over national news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17099)|
| 4:45:01| In fact, this morning it was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17101)|
| 4:45:04| They're trying to encourage people to be physician assistants and all because we're really in tough times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17104)|
| 4:45:10| and I think it's got to start in high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17110)|
| 4:45:14| I don't think there's very much peer group there to maybe encourage students to go into medical school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17114)|
| 4:45:20| and seek that medical degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17120)|
| 4:45:23| I know as for my daughter, there was nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17123)|
| 4:45:27| There was nothing there for any of the high school students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17127)|
| 4:45:29| I've seen these students at University of Tennessee, and like he says, they do a six-week program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17129)|
| 4:45:35| and what they do is they follow, they shadow doctors and all doctors, internal medicine, urologist, surgery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17135)|
| 4:45:43| GI doctors, every specialist that you could think of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17143)|
| 4:45:48| And so I really think it's a very well worth program, especially for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17148)|
| 4:45:54| We would be the ones to benefit to keep those kids in the state of Tennessee in medical school to come back and provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17154)|
| 4:46:00| So I have to say that I would love to see us be able for them to continue this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17160)|
| 4:46:08| because they're the only ones that I know of that's got anything like this out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17168)|
| 4:46:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17175)|
| 4:46:16| Actually, there are two other programs that are copycat programs in Johnson City and in Chattanooga that started up last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17176)|
| 4:46:23| As far as in here, in our area, Knoxville, that's the only one at UT, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17183)|
| 4:46:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17189)|
| 4:46:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17192)|
| 4:46:35| David Butler, Knoxville Museum of Art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17195)|
| 4:46:46| David Butler, 3516 Rains Lane, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17206)|
| 4:47:04| I'm here representing the Knoxville Museum of Art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17224)|
| 4:47:07| Thanks for giving me just a couple of minutes to mostly say thank you to Mayor Ragsdale and to Gloria Ray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17227)|
| 4:47:15| Are you still back there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17235)|
| 4:47:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17236)|
| 4:47:17| And the Tourism and Sports Commission for finding another pot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17237)|
| 4:47:21| So a museum is getting $25,000 under that plan about what we got last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17241)|
| 4:47:29| Thanks for that out-of-the-box thinking, and it's just what we need right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17249)|
| 4:47:35| It's a funny thing that when the economy got really shaky this year that attendance at museums and cultural organizations shot up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17255)|
| 4:47:43| and that was certainly the case at the KMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17263)|
| 4:47:46| Part of that was because we dropped our admission charge in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17266)|
| 4:47:49| That's been a huge success for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17269)|
| 4:47:53| By the middle of this summer, we will have welcomed about 60,000 visitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17273)|
| 4:47:59| plus another 10,000 or so Knox County students who participated in insight or classroom art education programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17279)|
| 4:48:10| We're doing all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17290)|
| 4:48:11| We're serving a lot more people as our budget shrinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17291)|
| 4:48:15| That's true for a lot of organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17295)|
| 4:48:18| We've trimmed our expenses substantially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17298)|
| 4:48:21| We've shaved the pay off of our senior staff by 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17301)|
| 4:48:25| I have taken a 20% pay cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17305)|
| 4:48:28| All of our staff is paying more of their health insurance premiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17308)|
| 4:48:35| Just in staff givebacks, starting July 1, we'll total about $57,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17315)|
| 4:48:43| We've really trimmed our sales, tightened our belts without, I think, compromising what we're able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17323)|
| 4:48:51| Our annual budget is about $1.5 million a year, and we couple that together from a lot of sources, public and private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17331)|
| 4:49:01| That $25,000 through the Sports and Tourism Commission makes a tremendous difference to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17341)|
| 4:49:08| I think it's fitting that the bed tax income is going this year to Knoxville cultural organizations who generate some of those dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17348)|
| 4:49:19| We're very lucky to have a number of very vibrant, viable cultural organizations in Knoxville, many of which are represented here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17359)|
| 4:49:29| All of us operate on a very thin margin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17369)|
| 4:49:33| One of my staff compared it to a hospital gown that several sizes too small, and no matter which way you tug it, something is always showing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17373)|
| 4:49:42| But anyway, on behalf of the KMA's 2,500 members, our 250 volunteers, and the many thousands who visit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17382)|
| 4:49:50| I want to reiterate my thanks to Mayor Ragsdale, to Gloria Ray for their leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17390)|
| 4:49:58| On a personal note, too, I want to offer an apology to Mayor Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17398)|
| 4:50:05| The newspaper called right after I saw all those zeros on the mayor's budget, and things were said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17405)|
| 4:50:12| If you see him, would you let him know that I'm sorry about how that turned out, and everything's turned out great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17412)|
| 4:50:19| I'm sure he'll get the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17419)|
| 4:50:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17421)|
| 4:50:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17422)|
| 4:50:23| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17423)|
| 4:50:24| Thank you for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17424)|
| 4:50:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17426)|
| 4:50:29| Next is Sarah Baker, YWCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17429)|
| 4:50:36| Sarah's not able to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17436)|
| 4:50:38| My name is Kelvin Cash, 8300 Brightmoor Court, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17438)|
| 4:50:47| And my role is Director of the Field Suite of the YWCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17447)|
| 4:50:53| First of all, I would like to express our thanks and appreciation for county support of the much-needed services provided by the YWCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17453)|
| 4:51:03| These are life-saving services that benefit individuals, families, and our community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17463)|
| 4:51:12| The YWCA Victim Advocacy Program, or VAP, works closely with the Knox County Sheriff Department and the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17472)|
| 4:51:22| Last year, the VAP served more than 6,000 victims, a 20% increase over 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17482)|
| 4:51:30| So far this year, KPD, the Sheriff Department, and the YWCA have seen an 11% increase in victims over 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17490)|
| 4:51:40| The VAP Project Assist Initiative provides support groups and a court advocate for victims who would not have assistance otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17500)|
| 4:51:51| Each week, there is approximately 200 domestic violence cases on the docket for Fourth Circuit Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17511)|
| 4:51:59| The advocate helps victims navigate the complex legal system and helps the court work more effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17519)|
| 4:52:08| The YWCA Senior Network, which is at the Phyllis Wheatley Center, has provided crucial services for very low-income seniors in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17528)|
| 4:52:16| East Knoxville for nearly 15 years at no cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17536)|
| 4:52:20| Seniors are the highest risk group for suicide due to health problems, financial limitations, and social isolation that often leads to depression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17540)|
| 4:52:33| But 100% of the seniors participating in our program have expressed greater life satisfaction after attending our Senior Network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17553)|
| 4:52:42| Over the summer, our seniors also get the opportunity to work on an intergenerational project with at-risk youth who benefit from their wisdom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17562)|
| 4:52:53| So again, on behalf of the YWCA, we'd like to thank you again for your support of these life-saving services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17573)|
| 4:53:01| The community certainly benefits greatly from our partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17581)|
| 4:53:05| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17585)|
| 4:53:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17590)|
| 4:53:11| Appreciate what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17591)|
| 4:53:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17592)|
| 4:53:16| Next is Phyllis Nichols, Knoxville Area Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17596)|
| 4:53:24| Phyllis Nichols, 9711 Valley Woods Lane, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17604)|
| 4:53:29| I want to thank you, as many of my colleagues did, for the opportunity today to just share a couple of my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17609)|
| 4:53:38| Number one, the Urban League is very appreciative to Knox County Commission and Knox County Administration for supporting our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17618)|
| 4:53:47| We're partners with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17627)|
| 4:53:50| And an example that I will give you is recently we partnered with Knox County, the city, the chamber for a transition fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17630)|
| 4:54:01| And this was a response to the growing unemployment in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17641)|
| 4:54:07| What Knox County was able to do was to provide a forum to say there are services in this community to help the recently unemployed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17647)|
| 4:54:17| and those who have not had to access services before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17657)|
| 4:54:22| But what Knox County cannot do is provide those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17662)|
| 4:54:26| And so that is why the partnership with the Urban League and other nonprofits is so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17666)|
| 4:54:34| We asked for a request for our workforce program, and we are very appreciative for what you have decided to partner with us on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17674)|
| 4:54:45| It is important not only because we meet some needs for citizens in Knox County, but it also helps the Urban League to leverage other funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17685)|
| 4:54:54| We apply for funds from foundations, from the federal government, and every grant or request that we ask, ask what's your local support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17694)|
| 4:55:06| And so the support from Knox County helps us to leverage additional dollars and bring those in to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17706)|
| 4:55:13| And the final thing that I want to bring for your consideration is that for the last four years we have come to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17713)|
| 4:55:28| because the grant dollars continue to shrink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17728)|
| 4:55:35| Each year that's 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17735)|
| 4:55:39| This is a very, very stressful time for the leaders of nonprofit organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17739)|
| 4:55:44| and we try to do everything that we can do to adapt to whatever the new process is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17744)|
| 4:55:52| to make sure that we're accountable, that we provide you all the information that you require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17752)|
| 4:55:59| But I think that our community has to have a discussion on the importance of nonprofits to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17759)|
| 4:56:08| If history serves, next year this same group, me and all these folks here, will be here requesting $500,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17768)|
| 4:56:19| and then the next year $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17779)|
| 4:56:21| I think it's very, very important that we have the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17781)|
| 4:56:25| Are we of value?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17785)|
| 4:56:28| Are we each year going to come before you asking for a lower and lower less amount of dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17788)|
| 4:56:38| I appreciate the over 5,000 people that the Urban League serves every year in all of our programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17798)|
| 4:56:46| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17806)|
| 4:56:48| But we're a part of a larger community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17808)|
| 4:56:51| I've been in the nonprofit sector for 24 years, and each one of these folks here do good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17811)|
| 4:56:58| I stand behind them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17818)|
| 4:57:00| But I would hope that as elected leaders of this community that you'll have the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17820)|
| 4:57:08| What is the value of nonprofits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17828)|
| 4:57:11| What are we going to put?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17831)|
| 4:57:13| What are we going to set aside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17833)|
| 4:57:16| And I hope you know that we serve as both a safety net and we also improve the quality of lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17836)|
| 4:57:22| Nonprofits do what you cannot do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17842)|
| 4:57:25| And we just want you to value that and help us to plan for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17845)|
| 4:57:30| Help us to know what this whole process is going to be like in the years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17850)|
| 4:57:37| And, again, I thank you for all that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17857)|
| 4:57:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17861)|
| 4:57:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17868)|
| 4:57:49| Next, Tom Parkhill, Tennessee Stage Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17869)|
| 4:57:59| Thank you, Tom Parkhill, 2822 Island Home Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17879)|
| 4:58:07| Our program, Tennessee Stage Company, is Shakespeare on the Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17887)|
| 4:58:11| I want to take just a second to thank all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17891)|
| 4:58:13| I can see that this has been a really long day, and I'm sure probably increasingly tedious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17893)|
| 4:58:19| And I think that you did not have to give us the opportunity to come before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17899)|
| 4:58:23| And everyone here, I think, enormously appreciates the opportunity to have just a moment to speak to you about what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17903)|
| 4:58:30| And we thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17910)|
| 4:58:32| I also want to thank the citizens review panels who put in such a long amount of time and hard work in making their reservations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17912)|
| 4:58:39| Recommendations, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17919)|
| 4:58:40| Now, our program, Shakespeare on the Square, has been recommended to receive some funding for which we are enormously appreciative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17920)|
| 4:58:46| I just want to remind you a couple of things about our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17926)|
| 4:58:49| We are a free public art event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17929)|
| 4:58:51| We charge no admission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17931)|
| 4:58:52| We always wanted our program to be absolutely accessible to everyone in the county, in the city, in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17932)|
| 4:58:58| So we perform absolutely free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17938)|
| 4:59:00| We also sell no concession items in our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17940)|
| 4:59:04| We willingly and somewhat perhaps foolishly decided to give up that ancillary source of income as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17944)|
| 4:59:11| because the other aspect of what we want to do with Shakespeare on the Square is be supportive of the businesses that are in operation in downtown Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17951)|
| 4:59:18| We urge our audience to buy everything they want to buy, food, drinks, gifts, from existing businesses on the square, not from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17958)|
| 4:59:25| So our program must be supported completely with what's known as unearned income, foundation grants, corporate sponsorships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17965)|
| 4:59:33| individual donations, and government funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17973)|
| 4:59:37| So we appreciate the fact that we have been recommended for funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17977)|
| 4:59:40| We appreciate what you do and want to say thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17980)|
| 4:59:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17985)|
| 4:59:49| Next is Rachel Ford, Knoxville Sympathy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17989)|
| 4:59:54| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17994)|
| 4:59:55| Rachel Ford, 1137 Gray Eagle Lane, Knoxville, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17995)|
| 4:59:59| As everyone else here this afternoon has said, thank you very much for allowing us to speak with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=17999)|
| 5:00:03| and thank you as a county and as a commission for supporting so many nonprofit organizations in our town and in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18003)|
| 5:00:10| We all do many different things, but we all do many things that give towards the quality of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18010)|
| 5:00:15| and make this such a rich place to live here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18015)|
| 5:00:20| We at the symphony truly appreciate the partnership that we have with Knox County and that we've had for many years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18020)|
| 5:00:26| As we impact over 200,000 people each year, we really try and ask the county for funding that will go back to our education programs specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18026)|
| 5:00:35| Twenty-five thousand students each year experience the symphony, and of those 25,000, 20,000 are Knox County school children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18035)|
| 5:00:41| And we reach them through our young people's concerts, through our side-by-side programs this year at Austin East and at Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18041)|
| 5:00:47| through our youth orchestra, and also through our library storytime programs that are free in 14, actually, 14 county libraries this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18047)|
| 5:00:56| These are all programs that we're seeing increased demand for and we're seeing increased participation in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18056)|
| 5:01:01| We feel that they're truly important, and we're proud to offer these things to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18061)|
| 5:01:05| They do come at a cost, and we appreciate all of the funding that has been given to us through the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18065)|
| 5:01:10| We look forward to working with you all in the future, and again, thank you for listening to us all today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18070)|
| 5:01:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18076)|
| 5:01:17| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18077)|
| 5:01:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18079)|
| 5:01:21| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18081)|
| 5:01:23| This is on one of these pieces of paper we have orchestra, $6,790.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18083)|
| 5:01:34| Then we have below it society with no dollars, and then we have on the addition $15,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18094)|
| 5:01:42| Where is all this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18102)|
| 5:01:45| We actually applied for two grants through the Community Development Program this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18105)|
| 5:01:48| One of them was funded at about half of its requested amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18108)|
| 5:01:51| That's the $6,000 figure you're seeing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18111)|
| 5:01:53| We also requested another grant that was not funded at all, and through the efforts of the Arts and Cultural Alliance and KTSC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18113)|
| 5:02:00| the $15,000 that you're seeing there is what we have also been generously granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18120)|
| 5:02:05| And the $15,000 is on the society request, then, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18125)|
