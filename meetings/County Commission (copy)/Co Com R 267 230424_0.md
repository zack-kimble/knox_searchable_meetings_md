| 0:20:46| In 2007, the General Assembly enacted the Property Tax Freeze Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1246.88)|
| 0:20:51| Knox County has been a part of that act since 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1251.88)|
| 0:20:55| Since then, the income limit has been $42,440 with around 4,700 people on the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1255.1200000000001)|
| 0:21:04| The reason I'm here today is to let you know Mayor Jacobs and I will be bringing a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1264.1200000000001)|
| 0:21:08| to you next month for an increase in which the state has passed to $60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1268.1200000000001)|
| 0:21:14| This will impact those who have fallen off the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1274.1200000000001)|
| 0:21:16| It will also assist in obtaining new seniors for the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1276.1200000000001)|
| 0:21:20| I have supplied a small packet of data which will show you inflation rates, buying power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1280.3600000000001)|

| 0:21:27| I was just here out of courtesy to let you know that we're going to be bringing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1287.3600000000001)|
| 0:21:32| to you so if anybody would like to contact me for anything, I have the data if anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1292.3600000000001)|
| 0:21:36| wants it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1296.3600000000001)|
| 0:21:37| And I want to thank Commissioner Schoonmaker for letting me come up here and speak today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1297.3600000000001)|
| 0:21:40| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1300.3600000000001)|

| 0:21:44| Commissioners, any discussion or questions for Trustee Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1304.3600000000001)|
| 0:21:47| Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1307.6000000000001)|
| 0:21:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1309.6000000000001)|
| 0:21:51| Thank you, Trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1311.6000000000001)|
| 0:21:52| I really appreciate you doing this and this actually kind of makes me tear up a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1312.6000000000001)|
| 0:21:58| bit because I had a constituent call me a few months ago and she just barely, it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1318.6000000000001)|
| 0:22:05| over, I think it was $560 that she thought that she wasn't going to qualify for and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1325.6000000000001)|
| 0:22:11| I was able to talk to somebody who's very knowledgeable in the senior section in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1331.6000000000001)|
| 0:22:15| office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1335.6000000000001)|
| 0:22:16| He directed me how to move her along and she's going to be able to now take care of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1336.8400000000001)|
| 0:22:22| and she was really struggling with food and medicine and so it just kind of tears me up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1342.8400000000001)|
| 0:22:28| So I'm very grateful that you guys are doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1348.8400000000001)|
| 0:22:31| I appreciate you and the mayor for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1351.8400000000001)|
| 0:22:33| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1353.8400000000001)|
| 0:22:34| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1354.8400000000001)|
| 0:22:35| For everybody here, the seniors in your districts, a lot of times these programs, you may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1355.8400000000001)|
| 0:22:41| see it, but the tax freeze capping and making it to where it can increase, that's the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1361.08)|
| 0:22:47| in a lot of these seniors being able to buy groceries or medications or maybe Christmas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1367.08)|
| 0:22:51| presents or other things and we've been working with our delegation on making sure that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1371.08)|
| 0:22:57| passes and I really want to mention them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1377.08)|
| 0:23:00| They've all worked very hard on this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1380.08)|
| 0:23:02| It actually passed 89 to 1 so I'm pretty proud of that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1382.08)|
| 0:23:06| Anybody have any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1386.08)|
| 0:23:10| Thank you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1390.32)|
| 0:23:11| I'll see you next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1391.32)|
| 0:23:12| Appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1392.32)|
| 0:23:33| Thank you, Trustee Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1413.32)|
| 0:23:35| Alright, this brings us to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1415.32)|
| 0:23:37| There are rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1417.56)|
| 0:23:38| Those who have signed up to speak on a particular agenda item may speak at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1418.56)|
| 0:23:42| We have 15 people who have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1422.56)|
| 0:23:46| First on the list is Patty King followed by Richard Hoffman Warner and then Justin Hurst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1426.56)|
| 0:23:52| Ms. King, if you would please approach the podium, state your name and county of residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1432.56)|
| 0:23:56| and you'll have three minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1436.56)|
| 0:23:59| Patty King, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1439.56)|
| 0:24:01| I'm here today about the resolution for support of Governor Lee's red flag law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1441.8)|
| 0:24:07| I oppose this law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1447.8)|
| 0:24:09| The reason being is these students behind us talked about the Parkland shooting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1449.8)|
| 0:24:14| I had a classmate and a friend of mine who was a teacher during the Parkland shooting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1454.8)|
| 0:24:19| She lost five students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1459.8)|
| 0:24:21| I messaged her the other day and asked her what she thought about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1461.8)|
| 0:24:27| She said the red flag law does nothing because these people can get the guns they want off the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1467.04)|
| 0:24:37| This is not a way to protect our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1477.04)|
| 0:24:40| The other resolution where we are upgrading our security, that's the resolution that I support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1480.04)|
| 0:24:46| because we do need to upgrade security in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1486.04)|
| 0:24:49| Public, private, even the homeschool co-op groups that are in churches and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1489.04)|
| 0:24:55| There needs to be ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1495.28)|
| 0:24:57| And one way is to prosecute these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1497.28)|
| 0:25:01| We don't prosecute enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1501.28)|
| 0:25:03| And when we prosecute, they get the lesser of the sentences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1503.28)|
| 0:25:07| The Parkland shooter got life in prison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1507.28)|
| 0:25:10| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1510.28)|
| 0:25:11| There's something wrong with that and the families are fighting that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1511.28)|
| 0:25:15| I'm fighting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1515.28)|
| 0:25:16| I'm from that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1516.28)|
| 0:25:17| I went to school close to that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1517.28)|
| 0:25:21| I have students, friends, and family members that are down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1521.52)|
| 0:25:26| that are still fighting for the protection that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1526.52)|
| 0:25:29| A red flag is not the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1529.52)|
| 0:25:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1532.52)|
| 0:25:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1536.52)|
| 0:25:37| Next is Richard Hoffman Warner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1537.52)|
| 0:25:42| Please state your name and county of residence and you'll have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1542.52)|
| 0:25:45| Richard Hoffman Warner and I'm a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1545.52)|
| 0:25:48| I'm here also to speak about the red flag laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1548.76)|
| 0:25:51| being pushed by the governor of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1551.76)|
| 0:25:54| Two things to note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1554.76)|
| 0:25:55| On the Parkland shooting, Nicholas Cruz, the shooter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1555.76)|
| 0:25:58| was arrested 19 times before he actually committed the shooting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1558.76)|
| 0:26:03| And he was not ever held accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1563.76)|
| 0:26:05| Some of the provisions of the Tennessee law, which I have proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1565.76)|
| 0:26:09| Tennessee law, which I particularly have issue with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1569.76)|
| 0:26:12| is that the low burden of proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1572.76)|
| 0:26:16| Section 3, the provisions of which this act can be put in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1576.0)|
| 0:26:21| is it places another in reasonable fear of violent behavior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1581.0)|
| 0:26:24| and serious physical harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1584.0)|
| 0:26:26| There's very low burden of proof for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1586.0)|
| 0:26:28| I will also point out that this law does not give a time frame of when this happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1588.0)|
| 0:26:33| Can it be any comment made when the law was enacted, before or after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1593.0)|
| 0:26:39| Some of the issues I have with this is I can assume everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1599.0)|
| 0:26:42| on the Knox County Commission has had something on Facebook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1602.0)|
| 0:26:45| which could be conceived as placing another person in a reasonable fear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1605.24)|
| 0:26:50| of violent behavior and serious physical harm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1610.24)|
| 0:26:53| whether it be a joke or a sarcastic comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1613.24)|
| 0:26:56| I would ask all of you, could you be held to the same standard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1616.24)|
| 0:27:00| Could someone put one of these orders against you or one of your loved ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1620.24)|
| 0:27:03| because of something you said previous to this law if it was passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1623.24)|
| 0:27:07| In many other states, these laws have been used with Facebook comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1627.24)|
| 0:27:12| Particularly in Maryland, a man was shot after a no-knock raid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1632.48)|
| 0:27:16| executed at 3 in the morning because someone didn't like what he said on Facebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1636.48)|
| 0:27:20| Once again, where is the liability on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1640.48)|
| 0:27:22| It would be to the sheriff's deputies that have to execute these no-knock warrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1642.48)|
| 0:27:27| I will also point out, similar to civil asset seizures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1647.48)|
| 0:27:31| the person who is accused of this has to pay for their own defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1651.48)|
| 0:27:35| The county can of course do it, but I could foresee that that would be a large burden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1655.48)|
| 0:27:40| especially if many people would use this to their own designs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1660.72)|
| 0:27:44| I will finally end up by pointing out that, as Ms. King said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1664.72)|
| 0:27:48| most of the guns used can be purchased either legally or illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1668.72)|
| 0:27:53| The shooter in Nashville purchased all of her firearms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1673.72)|
| 0:27:56| at least as much as we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1676.72)|
| 0:27:58| We would like to know her motives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1678.72)|
| 0:28:00| However, her manifesto, several pages long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1680.72)|
| 0:28:03| is still being held by the FBI for some type of review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1683.72)|
| 0:28:07| You could imagine her being somewhat of a domestic terrorist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1687.96)|
| 0:28:10| an anti-Christian in nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1690.96)|
| 0:28:12| that she attacked her own school for some ideological reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1692.96)|
| 0:28:15| So I would ask you all to reconsider any support for any of these red flag laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1695.96)|
| 0:28:20| They do not work in California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1700.96)|
| 0:28:22| They have not worked in Illinois or New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1702.96)|
| 0:28:25| These are terms for which people can be attacked politically for something they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1705.96)|
| 0:28:29| And remember, there is nothing in this provision that says someone can't go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1709.96)|
| 0:28:32| 20 years back in any of your history, or anyone else's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1712.96)|
| 0:28:37| and find some comments you made, either in jest or in seriousness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1717.2)|
| 0:28:40| that can be used to this law against you or your spouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1720.2)|
| 0:28:44| since you're in the same home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1724.2)|
| 0:28:46| I would seriously ask for Knox County Commission to reconsider any support for this law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1726.2)|
| 0:28:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1729.2)|
| 0:28:54| Thank you. Next is Justin Hurst, followed by Kristen Barnes and Debbie Stafford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1734.2)|
| 0:29:02| Justin Hurst, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1742.2)|
| 0:29:04| I guess I'd like to address the Nashville shooting in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1744.44)|
| 0:29:08| There was no point during that that a red flag law would have prevented it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1748.44)|
| 0:29:12| There was nobody saying, hey, this person is unstable and going to go shooting someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1752.44)|
| 0:29:17| So I would like to address red flag laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1757.44)|
| 0:29:21| and the notion of taking someone's weapons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1761.44)|
| 0:29:26| because of a perceived need for mental health treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1766.44)|
| 0:29:31| I think that it's going to have an unintended consequence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1771.68)|
| 0:29:35| in that people that may need mental health services will not seek them out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1775.68)|
| 0:29:39| and then you will have a person who needs mental health services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1779.68)|
| 0:29:42| isn't getting it, and is still armed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1782.68)|
| 0:29:45| So that is an unintended consequence that I think is very significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1785.68)|
| 0:29:49| Also, I'd like to say that this shooter in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1789.68)|
| 0:29:53| I believe, is one of many people in the trans community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1793.68)|
| 0:29:59| who perceive that they are being persecuted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1799.92)|
| 0:30:03| I think it's an unwarranted perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1803.92)|
| 0:30:07| I think that they're hearing this from all around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1807.92)|
| 0:30:11| I don't know who's actually ultimately to account for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1811.92)|
| 0:30:15| but they seem to be saying that there's a transgenocide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1815.92)|
| 0:30:19| that they're being persecuted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1819.92)|
| 0:30:21| When we talk about things like what people refer to informally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1821.92)|
| 0:30:27| as the anti-drag show bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1827.16)|
| 0:30:29| I think that we need to be more precise about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1829.16)|
| 0:30:32| People sometimes call that the anti-trans bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1832.16)|
| 0:30:34| It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1834.16)|
| 0:30:35| It is a bill that was designed to protect children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1835.16)|
| 0:30:38| from lewd shows of any kind, whether it's a man dressed as a woman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1838.16)|
| 0:30:43| a woman dressed as a man, someone not dressed at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1843.16)|
| 0:30:46| Children are not supposed to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1846.16)|
| 0:30:48| That was the intent of that law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1848.16)|
| 0:30:50| There's another law that intends to prevent a childhood whim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1850.16)|
| 0:30:54| from resulting in surgeries and treatments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1854.4)|
| 0:30:57| that have lifelong consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1857.4)|
| 0:30:59| I want to encourage people to talk about these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1859.4)|
| 0:31:03| precisely when they talk about bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1863.4)|
| 0:31:05| because there are forces out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1865.4)|
| 0:31:08| that are saying things that are not quite accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1868.4)|
| 0:31:11| that are getting people really riled up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1871.4)|
| 0:31:13| You see a lot of anger on the trans side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1873.4)|
| 0:31:16| and it ends up with things like the national shooting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1876.4)|
| 0:31:20| I don't think that the shooting would have happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1880.4)|
| 0:31:23| if there wasn't a perceived threat by the Christian right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1883.64)|
| 0:31:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1894.64)|
| 0:31:35| Those who are still going to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1895.64)|
| 0:31:38| please make sure you are speaking very close to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1898.64)|
| 0:31:42| They do not work if you're even a couple inches away from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1902.64)|
| 0:31:46| Next on our list is Kristen Barnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1906.64)|
| 0:31:53| Kristen Barnes, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1913.64)|
| 0:32:01| Okay, next is Debbie Stafford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1921.64)|
| 0:32:03| followed by Caroline Schoonover and Dane Shelton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1923.64)|
| 0:32:10| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1930.64)|
| 0:32:11| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1931.64)|
| 0:32:12| Thank you all for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1932.64)|
| 0:32:13| Don't worry, everyone will be able to hear me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1933.64)|
| 0:32:16| First, I want to commend the junior commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1936.64)|
| 0:32:18| for taking an active role in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1938.64)|
| 0:32:20| Ms. Stafford?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1940.64)|
| 0:32:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1941.64)|
| 0:32:22| Oh, I'm sorry, Debbie Stafford, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1942.88)|
| 0:32:25| But I do want to commend the junior commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1945.88)|
| 0:32:28| for trying to take an active role in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1948.88)|
| 0:32:30| We need far more young people to take an active interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1950.88)|
| 0:32:33| in our society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1953.88)|
| 0:32:34| and I just personally want to say that each of you matter very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1954.88)|
| 0:32:38| I would like to encourage each of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1958.88)|
| 0:32:40| to think about something called root cause analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1960.88)|
| 0:32:44| and decision making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1964.88)|
| 0:32:46| Root cause analysis attempts to get to the very core| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1966.88)|
| 0:32:50| of a given problem so that solutions can be found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1970.1200000000001)|
| 0:32:53| Root cause analysis is used across various industries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1973.1200000000001)|
| 0:32:57| health care, engineering, on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1977.1200000000001)|
| 0:33:00| There are several types of root cause analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1980.1200000000001)|
| 0:33:02| One of my personal favorites are the five whys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1982.1200000000001)|
| 0:33:05| because I love to ask why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1985.1200000000001)|
| 0:33:07| You take a given problem and then you ask why five times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1987.1200000000001)|
| 0:33:11| and hope to get into the core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1991.1200000000001)|
| 0:33:13| In this specific situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1993.1200000000001)|
| 0:33:15| for which I had a family member that attended Covenant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1995.1200000000001)|
| 0:33:19| why did a female shoot little Christian children and teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1999.3600000000001)|
| 0:33:23| None of us really knows that answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2003.3600000000001)|
| 0:33:25| though as someone mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2005.3600000000001)|
| 0:33:26| there is a manifest that was never released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2006.3600000000001)|
| 0:33:29| From there, we can ask why at least four more times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2009.3600000000001)|
| 0:33:33| probably lots more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2013.3600000000001)|
| 0:33:35| But that's where we all need to be working is why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2015.3600000000001)|
| 0:33:38| Why are these things happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2018.3600000000001)|
| 0:33:41| As you all have let us know before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2021.3600000000001)|
| 0:33:43| you all have no control over state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2023.3600000000001)|
| 0:33:46| For example, none of you have any control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2026.6000000000001)|
| 0:33:48| over state law 33-6-401,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2028.6000000000001)|
| 0:33:53| which the easiest way to explain it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2033.6000000000001)|
| 0:33:55| is Tennessee's version of the Baker Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2035.6000000000001)|
| 0:33:58| This is the state law for legally obtaining any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2038.6000000000001)|
| 0:34:01| for detaining anyone who has a serious emotional disturbance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2041.6000000000001)|
| 0:34:06| and is posing a significant risk of harm to self or others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2046.6000000000001)|
| 0:34:10| You see, someone who's at a significant risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2050.6)|
| 0:34:12| of harming self or others doesn't stop by being a risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2052.6)|
| 0:34:15| if a gun is removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2055.8399999999997)|
| 0:34:17| There are still vehicles, knives, baseball bats, fists, matches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2057.8399999999997)|
| 0:34:23| You get the picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2063.8399999999997)|
| 0:34:25| It's still the heart, the spirit, the core of the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2065.8399999999997)|
| 0:34:28| that's the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2068.8399999999997)|
| 0:34:30| not the mode for which they choose to harm others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2070.8399999999997)|
| 0:34:33| So to you, the County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2073.8399999999997)|
| 0:34:34| I support your influence as a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2074.8399999999997)|
| 0:34:36| to send messages to our state government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2076.8399999999997)|
| 0:34:39| but I do ask that you vote against a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2079.8399999999997)|
| 0:34:41| infringing on our legal citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2081.8399999999997)|

| 0:34:47| The core of the problem is the evil in the heart of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2087.08)|

| 0:39:05| my home and my birthplace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2345.76)|
| 0:39:07| to stand up and say, we hear you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2347.76)|
| 0:39:09| to the people that are terrified of losing a child to gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2349.76)|
| 0:39:12| But no, that would be impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2352.76)|

| 0:39:19| Just like how the kids at the Parkland shooting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2359.76)|
| 0:39:21| should have had a better relationship with their SRO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2361.76)|

| 0:39:34| which I imagine is only why 13% of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2374.76)|
| 0:39:36| that commit mass shootings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2376.76)|

| 0:39:40| Or perhaps we should simply wait and take charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2380.76)|
| 0:39:42| and fight for change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2382.76)|
| 0:39:44| because we're too afraid of backlash from political parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2384.76)|

| 0:39:51| Instead of all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2391.76)|
| 0:39:53| why don't we just take a stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2393.76)|

| 0:40:54| As an attorney, I'm actually not here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2454.76)|
| 0:40:56| really to talk to you about the Second Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2456.76)|
| 0:40:58| and the current construction of the Second Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2458.76)|
| 0:41:00| Under Bruin, I can simply say to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2460.76)|
| 0:41:02| that a red flag law does not pass that muster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2462.76)|
| 0:41:04| No such regulation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2464.76)|
| 0:41:06| such as a red flag law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2466.76)|
| 0:41:08| existed at the time that the Second Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2468.76)|
| 0:41:10| or Article 1, Section 26,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2470.76)|
| 0:41:12| which is the guns rights provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2472.76)|
| 0:41:14| in our Tennessee Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2474.76)|
| 0:41:16| I actually want to know, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2476.76)|
| 0:41:18| I just want to address the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2478.76)|
| 0:41:20| Can we have an honest discussion about guns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2480.76)|
| 0:41:22| And the answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2482.76)|
| 0:41:24| And why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2484.76)|
| 0:41:26| Well, just take the statistic that's in the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2486.76)|
| 0:41:28| that you all are considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2488.76)|
| 0:41:30| It says that the leading cause of death| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2490.76)|
| 0:41:32| for children is gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2492.76)|
| 0:41:34| And that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2494.76)|
| 0:41:36| Unless, of course, you want to include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2496.76)|
| 0:41:38| do we include 18 and 19-year-olds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2498.76)|
| 0:41:40| as children for criminal prosecutions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2500.76)|
| 0:41:42| Do we consider them children for sexual consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2502.76)|
| 0:41:44| Do we consider them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2504.76)|
| 0:41:46| children for our movies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2506.76)|
| 0:41:48| Do we consider them children for smoking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2508.76)|
| 0:41:50| Do we consider them children for voting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2510.76)|
| 0:41:52| The answer is no. They're adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2512.76)|
| 0:41:54| And 18 and 19-year-olds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2514.76)|
| 0:41:56| compose the greatest percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2516.76)|
| 0:41:58| of people killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2518.76)|
| 0:42:00| If you want to include all the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2520.76)|
| 0:42:02| under age 20, that's the greatest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2522.76)|
| 0:42:04| proportion of people who are killed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2524.76)|
| 0:42:06| by guns. And that's, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2526.76)|
| 0:42:08| because they're involved in things like gang wars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2528.76)|
| 0:42:10| and drug violence and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2530.76)|
| 0:42:12| It's not true that guns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2532.76)|
| 0:42:14| are the leading cause of death for children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2534.76)|
| 0:42:16| But gun grabbers use this for public policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2536.76)|
| 0:42:18| discussions because it's an emotional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2538.76)|
| 0:42:20| charge they can use to bludgeon the uninformed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2540.76)|
| 0:42:22| Did you all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2542.76)|
| 0:42:24| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2544.76)|
| 0:42:26| on March 26th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2546.76)|
| 0:42:28| on Interstate 24| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2548.76)|
| 0:42:30| in Robertson County that four children died| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2550.76)|
| 0:42:32| in a car wreck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2552.76)|
| 0:42:34| You probably don't know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2554.76)|
| 0:42:36| Why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2556.76)|
| 0:42:38| There were no marches in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2558.76)|
| 0:42:40| There was no taking over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2560.76)|
| 0:42:42| the House chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2562.76)|
| 0:42:44| for the General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2564.76)|
| 0:42:46| There was no national media attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2566.76)|
| 0:42:48| This happens all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2568.76)|
| 0:42:50| Children are killed in car wrecks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2570.76)|
| 0:42:52| And you probably don't know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2572.76)|
| 0:42:54| because there's been no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2574.76)|
| 0:42:56| emotional fear or national media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2576.76)|
| 0:42:58| frenzy. And I know what people are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2578.76)|
| 0:43:00| They're saying, oh, wait a minute, that's a false| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2580.76)|
| 0:43:02| equivalency because cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2582.76)|
| 0:43:04| are good and they're for transportation and guns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2584.76)|
| 0:43:06| are evil and they're bad. They're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2586.76)|
| 0:43:08| equivalent. That's not true because when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2588.76)|
| 0:43:10| you're defending your family or when a woman is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2590.76)|
| 0:43:12| defending herself from an attempted rape and shooting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2592.76)|
| 0:43:14| the assaulter, guns have a legitimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2594.76)|
| 0:43:16| purpose. So the proper way to frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2596.76)|
| 0:43:18| this issue is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2598.76)|
| 0:43:20| guns have a legitimate purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2600.76)|
| 0:43:22| and cars or vehicles have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2602.76)|
| 0:43:24| legitimate purpose and they both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2604.76)|
| 0:43:26| can be used in unlawful ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2606.76)|
| 0:43:28| So it's not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2608.76)|
| 0:43:30| false equivalency, but what is instructive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2610.76)|
| 0:43:32| is to observe the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2612.76)|
| 0:43:34| in reaction between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2614.76)|
| 0:43:36| tragedies that occur through the use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2616.76)|
| 0:43:38| of these two tools in an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2618.76)|
| 0:43:40| unlawful way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2620.76)|
| 0:43:42| Why is there such a stark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2622.76)|
| 0:43:44| difference? It's because there's an agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2624.76)|
| 0:43:46| There's an agenda by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2626.76)|
| 0:43:48| gun grabbers to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2628.76)|
| 0:43:50| take away guns. And the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2630.76)|
| 0:43:52| goal is to take away guns and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2632.76)|
| 0:43:54| perfectly happy to do it in an incremental way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2634.76)|
| 0:43:56| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2636.76)|
| 0:43:58| the question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2638.76)|
| 0:44:00| today, are you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2640.76)|
| 0:44:02| all going to draw the line and stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2642.76)|
| 0:44:04| against the emotional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2644.76)|
| 0:44:06| furor that the gun grabbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2646.76)|
| 0:44:08| want you to engage in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2648.76)|
| 0:44:10| and make a knee-jerk reaction or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2650.76)|
| 0:44:12| are you going to stand firm on principle? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2652.76)|
| 0:44:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2654.76)|

| 0:48:48| of my classmate with regard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2928.76)|

| 0:48:56| who is going to make the call on whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2936.76)|

| 0:49:04| would allow the government to go in and remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=2944.76)|

| 1:44:23| Several years ago, members of the Commission pushed to enter in a resolution declaring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6263.32)|
| 1:44:31| us a second amendment to Sanctuary County and I passed on that saying this is not our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6271.4400000000005)|
| 1:44:35| jurisdiction and yet this Commission took action to make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6275.64)|
| 1:44:42| Even though it was not likely legal or constitutional, it was passed anyway with flying colors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6282.160000000001)|
| 1:44:49| When I reread the resolution today, it's a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6289.6)|
| 1:44:53| It's a statement that at its core says we support our governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6293.3)|
| 1:44:59| It outlines virtually the same things that our governor is asking for of our lawmakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6299.32)|
| 1:45:11| It's not our job and not our jurisdiction to debate the merits of that, debate the constitutionality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6311.4)|
| 1:45:18| of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6318.12)|
| 1:45:19| That is for the lawmakers, that's for the judicial branch to be the check and balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6319.599999999999)|
| 1:45:24| to review laws just like any other law, but that statement says we support our governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6324.2)|
| 1:45:31| in his efforts to make this a better state and ultimately to make it a more perfect union| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6331.04)|
| 1:45:41| because it was not perfect when it began and we have continued to evolve and tweak and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6341.96)|
| 1:45:51| change and become, I think, a better country every single day and so a lot of language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6351.68)|

| 1:46:15| I'm not going to substitute, I'm not going to support the substitute motion because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6375.84)|
| 1:46:19| think the revised motion, frankly, did allow us to take a stand and say we support our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6379.88)|
| 1:46:26| governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6386.4800000000005)|
| 1:46:28| Not to dig into the merits of what might be legislated, but to say something incredibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6388.12)|

| 1:46:41| So I appreciate the time, I'm not going to support the substitute motion, but if for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6401.360000000001)|
| 1:46:47| some reason it would fail, then I would support the original motion on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6407.8)|

| 1:47:08| specific authority related to gun laws is the very reason why I seconded the substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6428.96)|

| 1:47:22| I think what we're doing here is we're making a statement of general support to our governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6442.120000000001)|
| 1:47:29| and legislature to explore further action that might be necessary to help mitigate gun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6449.120000000001)|

| 1:47:45| specified in the original amendment of the first resolution, I'm just not comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6465.88)|
| 1:47:52| getting into that level of specificity because of the fact that we're not the body that makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6472.84)|
| 1:47:57| the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6477.52)|
| 1:47:58| We're just making a statement of general support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6478.52)|
| 1:48:02| And furthermore, I do not support the governor in so much as he might ask for red flag laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6482.84)|
| 1:48:09| or any other such law that might go by a different name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6489.16)|
| 1:48:12| So I do support the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6492.32)|
| 1:48:18| Thank you, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6498.12)|

| 1:48:33| And I want to thank everyone who came out tonight and everyone who called or emailed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6513.48)|

| 1:48:58| And that's really where my hesitation began with the original resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6538.6)|
| 1:49:03| I have no doubt that we all agree that any act that results in the loss of life is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6543.2)|

| 1:49:18| I also have no doubt that as citizens, spouses, mothers and fathers, we all feel like we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6558.28)|
| 1:49:25| to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6565.679999999999)|
| 1:49:27| But I'm also of the opinion that action needs to produce effective solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6567.68)|
| 1:49:33| And it's my opinion that in order to do that, we need an opportunity to hear from all sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6573.84)|
| 1:49:38| and consider closely every perspective, inclusive of those from officials who were elected to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6578.76)|

| 1:50:21| An absence of discussion by lawmakers who represent the voices in this room, the voices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6621.4400000000005)|

| 1:54:09| and certainly a representative understands mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6849.639999999999)|
| 1:54:14| We are in a crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6854.28)|
| 1:54:15| You can see that in the streets with all the homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6855.72)|
| 1:54:19| I'm dealing with that in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6859.52)|
| 1:54:22| And a lot of it stems from mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6862.240000000001)|
| 1:54:25| So it's not only the guns, it is people are hurting, they're sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6865.12)|
| 1:54:30| And we don't have a way right now to accommodate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6870.26)|
| 1:54:34| And that's wrong for us to do to human beings who are hurting and sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6874.2)|
| 1:54:39| So I just, I want to thank everybody for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6879.76)|
| 1:54:43| And again, I want to thank Madam Chair and Vice Chair Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6883.96)|
| 1:54:52| Is there any more discussion regarding the substitute motion, Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6892.96)|
| 1:54:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6897.400000000001)|
| 1:55:01| During the work session, we kind of compared the bill that we were going to support the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6901.32)|
| 1:55:08| actions of Lieutenant Governor Randy McNally with his four ideas of how to improve school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6908.36)|
| 1:55:15| security and then, of course, this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6915.719999999999)|
| 1:55:19| The difference being Randy McNally's letter to the governor was backed up by a House and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6919.5199999999995)|
| 1:55:26| Senate bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6926.74)|
| 1:55:29| And we didn't have the final outcome when we met last Monday, but we have it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6929.04)|
| 1:55:35| It did pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6935.12)|
| 1:55:36| The Senate passed it just like us, unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6936.84)|
| 1:55:42| And the House passed it on Thursday of last week, but it wasn't unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6942.2)|
| 1:55:47| It was a vote of 86 to 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6947.5599999999995)|
| 1:55:52| And I guess what amazed me is we're trying to do something about a school safety act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6952.24)|
| 1:55:58| for all of Tennessee schools, not just public schools, but charter schools, private schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6958.3)|
| 1:56:05| and church schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6965.0)|
| 1:56:06| And we wanted to have safety plans and annual audits and locked front doors and cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6966.76)|
| 1:56:13| with audio and school resource officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6973.68)|
| 1:56:17| And I guess I was really disappointed that two of our state representatives in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6977.7)|
| 1:56:24| who represent the first and second commission districts, voted against the Enhanced School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6984.04)|
| 1:56:29| Safety Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6989.6)|
| 1:56:31| And so thank goodness it did pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6991.44)|
| 1:56:34| It's been signed by the Speaker of the House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6994.0)|
| 1:56:36| I have the Enrolled copy now, and the Lieutenant Governor will sign it probably this week and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=6996.8)|
| 1:56:45| then go to the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=7005.2)|
| 1:56:47| But the difference, I think, of what we're looking at today is there's no legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=7007.52)|
| 1:56:52| attached to the governor's executive order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=7012.04)|
| 1:56:55| And yes, he has said that he wants to go ahead and have a special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=7015.76)|
| 1:57:02| But when I read through the document that he submitted over the weekend, I agreed with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=7022.0)|
| 1:57:08| our law director of his analysis on a lot of these points that just he hasn't hit the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=7028.08)|
| 1:57:14| home run yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=7034.84)|
| 1:57:16| So personally, I would be in favor if we delayed making any kind of recommendation to the governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=7036.64)|
| 1:57:24| until we actually know what all the details are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=7044.6)|
| 1:57:27| So as far as the substitute motion goes, I'm teetering on just passing on that because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=7047.78)|
| 1:57:35| I just don't think we should be doing anything until we actually know what the governor and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=7055.54)|
| 1:57:41| the legislature wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=7061.7)|
| 1:57:44| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=7064.259999999999)|
| 1:57:47| Is there any more discussion for the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=7067.74)|
| 1:57:52| Seeing none, the motion on the floor is a substitute motion by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=7072.86)|
| 1:57:57| Commissioner Hill with a second by Commissioner Bealer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=7077.98)|

| 2:00:01| It probably needs to be waited upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=7201.62)|
