| 0:02:32| I'm like, man, I've got to go home and clean my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=152)|
| 0:02:35| I've got people coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=155)|
| 0:02:38| Move to adjourn the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| This Friday, oh my gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=162)|
| 0:02:44| Okay, let me start again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| I want to remind myself that city offices will be closed this Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| Trash and recycling pickup will still proceed as usual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| I hope everyone has a great holiday weekend with their families and friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| and I hope you have to rush home and clean your house as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=179)|
| 0:03:02| It means you've got people coming, which is always good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| So next week is Community Development Week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| an annual recognition of all the good work that our Community Development Department does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=187)|
| 0:03:11| and all of our partners throughout Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=191)|
| 0:03:14| It has heightened significance this year because, as you probably know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| there have been proposals up in Washington, D.C.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| to cut or even eliminate some of the major programs that support that work in community development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| things like our Community Development Block Grants and the HOME program in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| There are two events during the week we want to call to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=213)|
| 0:03:38| On Tuesday morning, April 18th, beginning at 7.30 a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=218)|
| 0:03:42| we'll have our annual Equity Awards Breakfast at The Standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| which is at 216 West Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| This is an opportunity to honor individuals, businesses, and organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| whose efforts have strengthened equity and inclusion in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| It's always great to see council members there, and so I hope all of you can join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| Then next Friday, April 21st, from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| our Community Development Department is hosting an open house in their offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| on the fifth floor of the City-County Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| This is an opportunity to meet the people who do this important work every single day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| and hear a little from them about their experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| I know they would love to see you all there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| Looking out towards the end of the month, I want to remind everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| make sure you have this on your calendar, that the annual State of the City Address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| which is where we present the budget, will be at 12 noon on Friday, April 28th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=275)|
| 0:04:41| at Sutry Landing Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| So I'll present my proposed budget for the next fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| and it will be a great chance to talk about where we are as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| and where we go from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| Plus, you get to enjoy a beautiful, the city's newest park in 12 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=291)|
| 0:04:57| the Sutry Landing Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| As you know, the parking is very limited at Sutry Landing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| so we're asking people to park in the garage on Blunt Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| behind the old Baptist Hospital site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| and we'll be running free shuttles from there to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| So I hope you can all join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| If you want to come, please RSVP by calling 311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| And again, that is a great civic event every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| We enjoy having a really big turnout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| It's at 12 noon on Friday, April 28th, at Sutry Landing Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| But we do need you to RSVP, so we'll have enough bag launches for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| Finally, I want to invite a guest to say a few words, Melissa Knight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| who's Executive Director of the Interfaith Health Clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| is here on behalf of the Community Health Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| She has a quick update on the Community Health Improvement Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| So thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| Thank you for having me, Mayor and Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| I am an outgoing member of the Community Health Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| I just wanted to give you an update on our CHIP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| the Community Health Improvement Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| I believe a year ago, last May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| Christy Altman from the Knoxville Track Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| came and updated everyone along with Dr. B. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| This plan that has been developed is a roadmap to improve four critical areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| that we have deemed are four important things our community needs to work on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| mental health, opioid abuse, tobacco use, and active living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| The Council has partnered with four groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| to draft and implement action plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| Where are we right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| We have just kind of kicked off those action plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=387)|
| 0:06:30| They're running from 2016 to 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| Some of the groups are actually implementing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| Others have identified gaps in data, and we're looking to bridge those gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| Some are working with law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| to help empower more individuals to have access to the different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| and we're also working with state level to adopt some of our more local priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=408)|
| 0:06:55| You have in front of you a summary of our CHIP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| I encourage you, if you have any questions, to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| Contact us at knoxchc at gmail.com| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| or to look at our website, healthyknox.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| At this particular point in time, we have no ask of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| which is always nice to stand in front of a group and not have to ask for anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| but we do just want to keep you appraised of what is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| One more thing that I want to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| is that we have been very pleased with the alignment across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| When Dr. Buchanan and Christy came to you all before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| we had already received the support of the hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| and they were implementing these four in theirs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| but also United Way adopted these four goals as part of their health and welfare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=459)|
| 0:07:44| so it is very encouraging to us to see the entire community come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| Again, thank you all for your support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=468)|
| 0:07:51| and it's nice to come without asking for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| Have a good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| Thank you. I just want to thank you for your service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| and all the members of the Community Health Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| Thank you for what you do. We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| And we'll read this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| Any questions from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| Okay, any reports from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| I'd like to just report that all of us are aware that Jim Bletner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| had passed away this past weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| and a number of us were with him the night before at one of our community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| And I've had the honor of knowing Jim for almost 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| He was quite a community activist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| and he and I were many times on the same side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| but a lot of times on the opposite side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| But Jim was reallyóhis heart was in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=513)|

| 0:08:40| and also the Kingston Pikes Sequoia Hills Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| and also the community forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| but he was really interested in his entire community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=525)|
| 0:08:48| in terms of things that he got involved with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| and also just being who he was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=531)|
| 0:08:54| I'd like to just readówhat I would like to do is get a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| that when we can present that to Donna and a number of his friends in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=538)|
| 0:09:04| But meanwhile, what I'd like to do is just read a few comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| I've gotten a number of comments from some of his friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| but Larry Silversteinó| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| Hold that mic down, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| Pull your mic down towards you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| Larry Silverstein wrote a tribute to Jim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| and I want to pull just some of the things that he had to say about Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| He said, Jim was a great guy who was dedicated to making our community a better place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| Jim attended and spoke at countless public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| including the night before he died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| Nobody could have asked for a better or more supportive friend or ally in the trenches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| trying to persuade others on the issue of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| Jim was a gentle soul and a true Southern gentleman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| but was filled with great passion and dedication to getting things done and making things better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| Jim was a great and courageous advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| He spoke softly most of the time, but when he talked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| others listened carefully and paid attention to what he said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| because they knew he had done his homework and knew what he was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| Jim earned the respect of all those he dealt with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| even those who disagreed with him from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| Jim had a big heart, a big smile, and a great wit and sense of humor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| but everyone knew when he was serious about something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| Jim worked very hard in all aspects of his life, and I know that he loved what he was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| His spirit will live forever in each of us who were fortunate enough to have Jim in our hearts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=620)|
| 0:10:26| So our sympathies go out to his family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| So thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| I just want to announce as part of Architecture Week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| they're having a design symposium on Friday night, this Friday, 7 p.m. at the Square Room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| The speakers are Wayne Blasius, Carol Evans, Brian Hand, Jack Neely, Keith Caseman, and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=644)|
| 0:10:52| And we're going to be answering the question, what makes a livable city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| So I don't know what they're going to say, but I'm going to talk about zoning and walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| Anyway, it should be a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| Come on out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| If your family's in town, bring them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| Or if you need to get away from them, it's a good excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| Come on out for Good Friday, Friday night, 7 o'clock at the Square Room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| All right, we'll move on to the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| 9A is an ordinance appropriating the sum of $5,000 from the Parks and Recreation Department funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| and donating same to Fountain City Lions Club to be utilized toward the maintenance and upkeep of Fountain City Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| 10A is a resolution approving an appeal by Capso Properties LLC of the Board of Zoning Appeals' decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| to deny a variance to reduce the minimum required separation distance that an alternative financial service facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=705)|
| 0:11:52| must maintain from a residential district from 1,000 feet to 89.3 feet in a C3 district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=712)|
| 0:11:59| excuse me, C3F1 district property located at 3515 North Broadway, 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=719)|
| 0:12:06| Okay, so this is an appeal, so I just want to state our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| We'll first hear from the appellant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| They can have up to three speakers for up to five minutes each,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| and I keep tabs on the time and let you know when you're getting close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| And then we'll hear from the respondents, and we have three people who were signed up to speak against, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=741)|
| 0:12:31| These are the respondents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Speak against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| And then we go back and the appellant, no, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| Yeah, that's right, because the owner is appealing, so I had it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| And then the appellant can then get up to two minutes for a rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| Could we ask Rob Frost a quick question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| Would you advise us of the nature of this proceeding in terms of what we are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| and how we are sitting as a quasi-appellate body, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| Well, this is a variance from a decision, an appeal of a variance from a decision made by the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=780)|
| 0:13:08| with a four-to-one vote stated in the appellant's record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=788)|
| 0:13:14| They disagreed, and they cited in the record that this deprives them of the highest and best use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=794)|
| 0:13:24| So they, as far as I know, appealed in time to be heard by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=804)|
| 0:13:31| And this body is acting on the record before it, including tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| Okay, so the appellants, I don't have any names, so you look like you must be one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| You look like you want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| Please state your name and address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| Yes, my name is Tony Cappiello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| My address is 800 South Gay Street, Suite 1405.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| I'm here on behalf of Capso Properties, the owner of the property, and serving as corporate counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=836)|
| 0:14:04| but as a matter of disclosure, I'm also a member of that LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| We're here tonight because we've been spending about a year and a half on this particular piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=848)|
| 0:14:15| and due to what I call detrimental reliance on things and documents that the city has provided us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=855)|
| 0:14:25| we proceeded to purchase this property, redevelop the property for an intended use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=865)|
| 0:14:34| It is no secret that that use was a pawn shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| It's called U.S. Money Shops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| They do have one facility here in Knoxville on Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| but it's a very orderly-looking Walmart-type property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| I won't bore you with the 169 pages of documents that you'll find in your files regarding this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=887)|
| 0:14:56| but that is a testament to how long this property has been in consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| and we've been dealing with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| I will point out, though, page 74 of your packet under 10AC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=904)|
| 0:15:11| you will see a certificate of zoning letter that was issued to check in the cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=911)|
| 0:15:17| Again, U.S. Money Shops, that's a DBA, and that was done on December 6, 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=917)|
| 0:15:27| again, about a year and a half ago at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| You'll see that it is checked for financial services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| So with reliance on this letter and then talking to the city, the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=934)|
| 0:15:40| we were told that we could actually operate a pawn shop on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=940)|
| 0:15:47| We were subsequently told that no, actually you cannot because of the F1 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| You have to go for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| We properly applied under the time constraints that were issued to us to rezone the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=954)|
| 0:16:01| In conjunction with this and simultaneously with this filing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| city council decided to pass the ordinance, the Alternative Financial Services Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| I think an ordinance proposed by Mr. Pavlis initially, and that went into immediate effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=971)|
| 0:16:17| Almost simultaneously with us getting the rezoning as directed by the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| this went into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| However, we were yet again told that we could go ahead and operate in this retail facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=984)|
| 0:16:31| Some months later, the law department for the city then issued a statement saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| that this use was denied because of that particular ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=996)|
| 0:16:42| So we bought this property, a $520,000 property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1002)|
| 0:16:48| We began to do miscellaneous repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| Because it's in the floodway, you can only do so many repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| We bought it for this tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| You'll probably have residents tonight say, well, you know, you could just rent it to somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| Our sign is on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| We're unable to rent it so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| But we buy properties for a specific investment for a specific tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1026)|
| 0:17:12| And as you may know, those of you who are in real estate or have dealt with real estate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| many times you buy property for a specific tenant because they can pay more than another tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1036)|
| 0:17:23| And that was the case in this particular circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| When we got the letter from the city, we said, what can we do next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| And they said, well, you need to file for a variance and reduce the restriction from some 1,000 feet to 88 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1050)|
| 0:17:38| So we went to the BZA, and that's where you have this denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| That's why we're appearing here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| Even if you look at similar state statutes, whenever they enact a statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| they typically give you time to process those ongoing activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| In this particular case, we felt like we did everything right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| We were directed by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| We have letters from the city saying, you know, you can do this use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| But yet we were caught in this maze of procedure and therefore unable to affect the use that we had in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1088)|
| 0:18:18| We have a good corporate citizen, Mr. Alan Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| He's donated the university over $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| He owns this company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| He's a good corporate citizen, and we ask that the variance be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| Do we have anybody else to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| So you'll be able to come back with a two-minute rebuttal after we hear from the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| Okay, so I'll first call up Deborah Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1123)|
| 0:18:51| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| My name is Deborah Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| I live at 428 East Burwell Avenue, 37917, and I would like to thank council and the mayor for the opportunity to speak tonight for my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1139)|
| 0:19:09| I'm speaking at the request of the Oakwood Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association Board of Directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1149)|
| 0:19:15| I serve as the treasurer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| Our mission is to promote and build a healthy environment for everyone who lives and works in Oakwood Lincoln Park neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1157)|
| 0:19:24| We represent over 2,500 households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| The Oakwood Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association Board of Directors does not support the variance request at 3515 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1167)|
| 0:19:35| We urge the city council to deny this appeal of the BZA decision for reduced distance variance for an alternative financing service to a residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1175)|
| 0:19:46| We ask that the distance requirements in the Knoxville City Code Appendix B, Article 5, Section 26 be upheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1186)|
| 0:19:55| Our own unofficial census has identified at least 11 alternative financing service facilities within a mile of 3515 Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1195)|
| 0:20:03| Please refer to the list that I passed out at the beginning of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| Adding another AFS to our neighborhood violates the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| The ordinance was in place when the property was sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| The current C3F1 zoning allows the owner to operate a business that would enhance the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| The applicant has not met the requirements for granting of a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| This is a non-valid legal hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| The variance was denied by the BZA by a vote of 4 to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| They are not deprived of any reasonable use of this land if the variance is not granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| There must be a deprivation of beneficial use of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| We respectfully request the city council uphold the BZA decision and deny this appeal request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| Thank you for your time and attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| And I would also like to point out that we have several people here in the crowd from Oakwood, Lincoln Park, Edgemont, Amarillyn, Fairmont, and possibly Old North.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1247)|
| 0:20:58| So could you please stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| South Knoxville, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| And now, Steve Cotham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| State your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| My name is Steve Cotham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| I live at 1712 Amarillyn Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| I've lived there for 19 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| And we've faced a lot of challenges in those years that I've lived there working with the city, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1282)|
| 0:21:29| We had some inappropriate buildings put in the neighborhood, and we worked to get a neighborhood conservation overlay for our neighborhood, which was a big step forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1289)|
| 0:21:38| And the city proposed a really awful flood control plan for our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| After working with city engineering for a number of years, the product that came out of that was, I think, a model for the city to pursue in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1303)|
| 0:21:51| It's attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| It enhances the neighborhood, and it makes the city the better place to live, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1312)|
| 0:22:00| Thirty years ago, when I first became interested in historic preservation, the property values in our neighborhood have held really solid for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1320)|
| 0:22:08| And when Oldworth, Knoxville, and Forth and Gill and some of the early preservation movements started, they were able to look to us to find comps for real estate appraisals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1328)|
| 0:22:18| And I'm happy to say that they have far exceeded the comps that we can provide them today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| They've done exceedingly well with preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| I would like to ask you to support the ordinance that the city passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1347)|
| 0:22:35| I think the ordinance is important because it creates a buffer with neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| And this particular business will be right at the entrance to Emerland Boulevard, where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| It would be 350 feet from the door of this business to the door of a residence with an H1 overlay, which is pretty close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1365)|
| 0:22:54| And 1,000 feet is really a pretty small distance to create as a buffer, but less than 100 feet is just not good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1374)|
| 0:23:02| This is not denying the applicant the use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| It's denying the applicant one use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| And we hope that you will support the ordinance and support us and make our city a better place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1389)|
| 0:23:16| Thank you, Mr. Cobb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| Next is Jim Brady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1398)|
| 0:23:24| I don't know whose microphone is making that noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| Could be mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| My name is Jim Brady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| I live at 208 Linford Road, 37920 in Mr. Pavlis's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1414)|
| 0:23:41| Members of the council, Mr. Swanson, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| NIMBY.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| We all know this term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| Not in my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| It's a common theme we hear in business all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1429)|
| 0:23:56| I grew up in New Jersey, and we had a comment that I guess was very popular on the Sopranos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1436)|
| 0:24:03| I won't profane the chamber by saying it, but you don't throw trash where you eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1443)|
| 0:24:10| I'd like to reflect the fact that the appellant was referencing his office on Gay Street, not his residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1450)|
| 0:24:20| I'm in the south Knoxville district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| We live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| This is where our homes are, our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| This is where we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| This property was purchased 18 months after this body made movement with Mr. Green and the MPC to start looking at these businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1472)|
| 0:24:45| I do not believe that this is an underserviced demographic in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1485)|
| 0:24:51| If anything, it's a potentially overexploited demographic, but that would probably be an issue for our legislature to look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1491)|
| 0:25:00| I don't believe that a hardship exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| I believe that this is an issue of want versus need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| I do not believe that there is a need for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| When I first read the appeal, I had to reread it a few times to see that I was actually reading 89.3 and not 893.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1511)|
| 0:25:22| The 89.3 reduction, or a reduction to 89.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| So I do applaud your bravado. I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| This isn't a situation where they're going to be establishing a caretaker's residence in the back of the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| and reading bedtime stories to their children under the light of a neon sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| This is a predatory business, and this body has already invested a tremendous amount of its time, effort, money, and resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1542)|
| 0:25:52| into finding legislation that actually meets the needs of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| I think that anything that would detract from that is disrespectful to that effort, that time, and our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1557)|
| 0:26:07| Our tax dollars that went into this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| I asked Mr. Wallace when we passed this to come across the aisle and vote so that we had a unanimous decision on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1573)|
| 0:26:20| because it was that strong of an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| I believe in the community we live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| This is not an issue of need. This is predatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| And I want to see our community grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| I think that the reason that there's difficulty in potentially renting this property out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| is a direct result of the 11 other businesses of this kind in that neighborhood, within a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1598)|
| 0:26:46| Try an ice cream stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1606)|
| 0:26:52| We've had this issue. It's about community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| Community is a group of men and women leading a common life according to a rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| I'd like to see the body send a message that the next time this is thought about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| well, we have this rule, but not on Tuesday, that maybe somebody will think twice about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1626)|
| 0:27:13| We're not squashing someone's potential dream of a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| We're trying to uphold someone's dream of having a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| Okay, Mr. Capiello, would you like a rebuttal after two minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1646)|
| 0:27:33| I appreciate the citizens' points and their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| This is not what you might think of a pawn shop of old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1659)|
| 0:27:47| I think it's a bit of a knee-jerk reaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| and you can't regulate every use that you disagree with away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1670)|
| 0:27:56| It would, I think, be short-sighted to say that I don't invest in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| and I put good, reputable tenants throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1682)|
| 0:28:08| This particular use is not offensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| It is not, in my opinion, predatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| In fact, I go into pawn shops myself to look at old watches and estate jewelry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1696)|
| 0:28:22| It's not that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| What we're here for tonight is procedurally we were caught in a trap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1704)|
| 0:28:30| The city told us we could do this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| There was a hardship because this property is basically a peninsula surrounded by water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| It was a floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| We had to do many steps to get to where we needed to be with the city's direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| So for that matter and for that reason, I ask for the variance to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1727)|
| 0:28:53| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| Now, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| Some of this has been said, but I've reviewed the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| I've got some notes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| The decision in the record, I've also reviewed Article 7, Section 2 on variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| and make it part of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| I'd like to discuss those criteria for granting a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| The purpose of the variance is to modify the strict application of the specific requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| of this ordinance in the case of exceptionally irregular, narrow, shallow, or steep lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| or other exceptional physical conditions whereby such strict application would result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1766)|
| 0:29:33| in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, which would deprive an owner of the reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| Under standards and variances, in granting a variance, the Board shall ascertain that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| the following criteria are met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| One, variances shall be granted only where special circumstances or conditions such as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| exceptional narrowness, topography, or siding fully described in the findings of the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1791)|
| 0:29:57| do not apply generally in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| Two, variances shall be granted to allow use otherwise excluded from the particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| district in which requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| Mere loss in value shall not justify a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| There must be a deprivation of beneficial use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| Under requirements for granting a variance, before the Board shall the authority to grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| a variance, the person claiming the variance has the burden of showing, one, that the granting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| of the permit will not be contrary to the public interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| Two, that the literal enforcement of the ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| Three, that by granting the permit contrary to the provisions of the ordinance, the spirit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| of the ordinance will be observed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| And four, that by granting the permit, substantial justice will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| Considering the record and appeal of the decision which states the property is being denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| its highest and best use, I do not believe that the standards for granting variance have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| There are no special circumstances or conditions such as narrowness or topography, and mere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| loss of value shall not justify a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| There must be a deprivation of beneficial use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| The property owner is not shown unnecessary hardship, as the property owner may use the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| land for a number of other commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| Therefore, I move to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| Councilman Delivopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| This particular request or appeal has some special circumstances, and I can understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1877)|
| 0:31:25| Mr. Cappiello's plea that he started out down the path in a proper manner by seeking, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1885)|
| 0:31:34| know, advice on what is the proper zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| He went for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| He applied for business licenses and so forth, and he expended money on improving the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1899)|
| 0:31:46| And that makes it a harder decision, but the reality is that this body debated long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1906)|
| 0:31:53| and hard and asked for the advice of MPC in the past year, year and a half, to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1913)|
| 0:32:00| with a way to regulate this situation of too many alternate finance entities that crowd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1920)|
| 0:32:10| on some of the corridors of our city, whether it's Chapman Highway, whether it's Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| whether it's Sutherland, other places where that type of business thrives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| And I don't think we have to get into a pejorative of whether it's a good or bad business, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| we did make, I think, a very conscious decision that these should be limited in proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1945)|
| 0:32:32| And 1,000 feet is not that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| I mean, what's that, a fifth of a mile, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| But they can't just be right next to each other, kind of piling on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| Now, I don't know about the 12 and a mile, but within 1,000 feet, there still are other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1962)|
| 0:32:48| facilities like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| And because this is a residential zone, I think that we should rely on our recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1970)|
| 0:32:58| adopted statute and deny this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| This gentleman, if he thinks he is out of money in reliance on something the city did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1982)|
| 0:33:09| or didn't do properly or MPC, he's a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| He knows he has remedies in court or whatever, and he can pursue it somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| But he's a smart businessman, and he's going to find a way to lease or sell that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| and put it to productive use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| I agree with Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| It's not a situation where no reasonable use can be made of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| The hardship is one of technicalities in terms of timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| But there was no permit issued where he relied on that and expended money to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2017)|
| 0:33:43| or expand the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| And in that situation, I don't think he's grandfathered, and I think it's unfortunate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| that he went pretty far down this path before the lights came on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| But again, our laws are public events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| People can find out about them in the newspaper, in MuniCode online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| It's the law of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| And I don't see a strong reason, even though there are inequities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| a strong reason to upset what we set out to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| And Mr. Pavlis took us down Chapman Highway and showed the number of facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| We have it on Broadway. We have it in other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| I think it's time that we start cleaning up our city and encouraging healthy businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2063)|
| 0:34:30| And I really hope that Mr. Cappiello will find some tenant, some person or entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2070)|
| 0:34:36| that wants to buy it if he doesn't want to lease it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| that will add to the community rather than put a strain on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| One of the things, if you read this very long record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| one of the things they're going to make money on is selling used guns and whatnot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| and trading on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| And we surely don't need more of that in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| And like I said, it is a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| It's one that's struggled and has maintained a high quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| And I think that we should support that, even though it causes some heartburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| And I feel for Mr. Cappiello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| He has been a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| There's good things on Kingston Pike and elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| But I think we should enforce our alternate finance restriction and deny this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2112)|
| 0:35:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| What most likely will be a solo opinion, I challenge you to rethink this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2123)|
| 0:35:32| Not about the district requirement, not about payday lenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| That's not what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| This is about an equity done on behalf of the city to a developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2137)|
| 0:35:45| regardless of the use, regardless of the money that he has spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| It's very prudent of any business and any entrepreneur to seek out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| what is the zoning of a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| Is there buying it before they close on it, when they're beginning to make improvements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| It's very prudent to any business owner or tenant to have a letter from the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| that says that this use is permitted in this zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2169)|
| 0:36:15| That letter, dated in September of 2016, is what I would call in my slang term a bankable letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2175)|
| 0:36:23| It's a letter that you would take to the bank and say to the bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| and I don't know if he did or not, but in most cases I would be taking that letter to the bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| and saying to the bank, here's a letter that says I had the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2191)|
| 0:36:37| the applicable zoning to do this business, now loan me the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| That is prudent. It is good business practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| When I have a letter from the city that says that, that is gold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| It's not his responsibility to challenge that or look in the muni code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| or look anywhere else to challenge that and see if it's right or wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| That's the letter that he goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| And to wait five months to come back with another letter five months later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| after all the work's been done, after all the money's been spent on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| regardless of how much it was, regardless of what the use was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| regardless of the distance requirement, think what you've done to this guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| Now you say, no, that letter's no good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| That letter that you got five months ago is invalid because it was rewritten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2240)|
| 0:37:26| And I think that when you have, it's the moral right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| When you've told somebody in writing, and you can find a law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| and you can probably find the loophole to try to get out of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| but at the end of the day, when I put my name on my letterhead and I've signed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| I'm going to own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| And you've got to own this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| I think you have to own it from a moral standpoint that you have committed to this person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| and to this business that that was the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| And to come back, and I'm not suggesting that we need more payday lenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2275)|
| 0:38:01| That's not at the crux of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| It's not at the crux of this about the distance requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| I'm not even a fan of variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| I voted against variances in the past for minor issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| I don't necessarily like variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| But in this case, the hardship is that he was told in writing by the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| that he had the right zoning, and he spent money on it and went forward on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| And when you come back five months later and say, oh, by the way, that's our mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| And I'm not trying to throw Mr. Eller under the bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| but I think when it's in writing, it's in our documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| And I can't support voting no on this appeal because of what's been laid out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2319)|
| 0:38:49| regardless of the use, regardless of the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| I will confirm what Mr. Cappiello said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| You buy a piece of property for a particular use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| and you're willing to pay a particular price for that property based on what a tenant will pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| Certain tenants will pay more for locations on high-traffic roads than others will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2346)|
| 0:39:14| Certain tenants will pay more. That's the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| They're going to buy the property. They're going to put the improvements in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| I'm going to sign a lease, and I expect a return on my investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| And certain businesses will pay more. There's no doubt about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| Convenience stores will pay more than a dental office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| They'll pay more than an ice cream shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| And so will a payday lender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| So it's not about what he's denied to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| He's not being denied that he can use it for other things, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| But when you set out for that particular—you're willing to pay that much money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2383)|
| 0:39:49| and you're willing—based on that you can lease it and based on that you're getting a return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| And he's being denied that because we made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| That's where it gets wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| And I just think that you really need to look at that not in terms of what the setback is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2399)|
| 0:40:05| I'm not arguing that we—I think we made a right—made a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| We certainly own it, and I can live by that, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| But in this case, I think there's other extenuating circumstances that make it very unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2412)|
| 0:40:19| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| John King with my firm was involved in this, so I need to recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2422)|
| 0:40:32| Who's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| I can appreciate where Councilman Wallace is coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| but I think that the thing that we need to keep in mind is there was a lot of work done on this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2440)|
| 0:40:46| and I appreciated the pretty well overwhelming support of Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| to pass what I think really should have been a stiffer ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2451)|
| 0:40:57| but, you know, you've got to go with what you think you can pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| And we did so, and this is the first time it's been challenged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| and I hope that the Council will reaffirm their decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2463)|
| 0:41:10| And, you know, I do think that it does our community harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| I wouldn't have brought this ordinance in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| And if you go up and down our corridors, I think Councilman De La Volpe is a little too kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| I mean, I think it looks, I just don't think it represents our city very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2483)|
| 0:41:28| I mean, it's just not what I want to see up and down the major corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| But most importantly, we can't forget the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| and particularly this neighborhood, having lived here all my life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| and seen what they went through with the flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| how it's such a stable, nice, attractive, beautiful neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| Now, I don't want to do anything to deter that stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2508)|
| 0:41:55| So I think we have to look at the other side, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| There's two sides of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| and I think the neighborhood should be given the consideration of what they've been through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| and where they're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| And so I just urge Council to uphold the ordinance and deny the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2527)|
| 0:42:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| Vice Mayor Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| Did we make a mistake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| Well, if you look at the September 16 letter that Councilman Wallace has referred to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2545)|
| 0:42:31| what that letter says is a retail establishment is a permitted use in the general commercial C3 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2551)|
| 0:42:40| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| Now, do I wish it had gone on to say an alternative financial business comes within the new code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2562)|
| 0:42:51| which was adopted on the same day, which became effective, at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| on the same day that that letter was written?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| It would have been preferable to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| But what the letter says is true, and it was true then, it's true today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2580)|
| 0:43:06| A retail establishment is a permitted use in the C3 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| So I don't believe that this letter is incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2591)|
| 0:43:16| It just doesn't have enough information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| And in my mind, it's the obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| When you ask the question, can we put a pawn shop here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| what you get to answer is you can put a retail establishment in this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2606)|
| 0:43:32| You need to look up on that and find out whether a pawn shop is one of the retail establishments that you can have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2612)|
| 0:43:39| So the question that you asked was, was it a mistake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2619)|
| 0:43:46| I think it could have been more complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| It could have been more complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| Is the remedy for that violating your own ordinances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| Councilman Della Voti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| Well, you know, I agree with just about everyone who said something here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| I think the key, though, is that the remedy that he has is not to get a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2646)|
| 0:44:15| when he doesn't meet the legal criteria for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| If he thinks he has been harmed by action that's inappropriate by the city or MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2659)|
| 0:44:25| then he has recourse to our very fine courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| And if he's been out of pocket money, he can chase that theory there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| But a variance is not called for in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| And like Councilman Pavlis said, we're trying to protect and strengthen neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2677)|
| 0:44:44| And I think the decision of no variance does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| If there's some other consequence from the prior activity, make it so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| I just think that we shouldn't give the wrong remedy for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| So we have a motion to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| So if you agree with Councilman Campin to deny the appeal, you say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| If you don't, if you support Mr. Cappiello, you vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| Is everyone clear on what the motion is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| Let's do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| This is a motion to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| Councilman Brown. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| Councilman Campin. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| Councilman De La Volpe. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| Vice Mayor Greve. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| Councilwoman Palmer. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| Councilman Pavlis. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| Councilman Saunders. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| Councilman Starrer accuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| Councilman Wallace. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| So the motion to deny the appeal passes seven to one, to one with one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2743)|
| 0:45:54| Thank you everyone who came and gave the information to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2754)|
| 0:46:00| Okay, so we will now move on to resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2760)|
| 0:46:07| 11A is a resolution approving a contract between the City of Knoxville and Crosland & Associates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| to audit the accounts of the City of Knoxville for the period of July 1, 2016 to July 30, 2017| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2772)|
| 0:46:18| for a contract price of $173,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| Move to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| Councilman De La Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| Yeah, just a quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| The audit committee has been working with Crosland & Associates and we are happy with their performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2785)|
| 0:46:33| We are extending an existing contract for a year here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2793)|
| 0:46:37| We will probably be in the process this fall or winter of considering an RFP-type proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2797)|
| 0:46:46| that would go out to see if there are other people that would want to bid on our audit work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| but they have been responsive to the City and I think this is a worthwhile contract renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| Thank you. So we have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2819)|

| 0:47:47| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| Thank you. I just want to say that I talked to Mr. Hagerman and there will be sidewalks as part of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2868)|
| 0:47:54| That's a big concern in the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2874)|
| 0:47:59| So we have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2879)|

| 0:48:20| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=2900)|

| 0:50:03| for an amount not to exceed $99,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| We have a motion and a second. Councilman Dalibopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| Yeah, Jim Hagerman, of course we all want to replace damaged guardrails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| Does this have anything at all to do with, I guess there have been some media reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| about some square plate, end plate on guardrails that may cause harm or damage in an accident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3019)|
| 0:50:26| or is this simply it's already been damaged and we're replacing a defective guardrail around the city in various places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3026)|
| 0:50:34| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| It is the latter. We did an inventory recently of guardrail condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3037)|
| 0:50:44| and this is the 16 highest priority sites that were in the worst condition that needed to be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3044)|
| 0:50:51| As far as I know, we don't have any of those end terminals in our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3051)|
| 0:50:58| Yeah, there was something about high speed crashes into those end terminals that may exacerbate harm or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3058)|
| 0:51:04| Yeah, well we also, to go into more detail than is probably necessary, TDOT is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3064)|
| 0:51:11| The answer is no though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| The answer is no. We don't have any high speed roads for one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| Okay, thank you. You meant to turn it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| He's never been on Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| That's not ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| Not ours, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| It's in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| Okay, we have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| 11A as a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with GALS Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| to provide online purchasing of uniform items for the Knoxville Fire Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3101)|

| 0:51:54| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| Gallivanti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| Yeah, we've got the chief here. I guess he's standing up for the other four departments that may be using this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3117)|
| 0:52:03| It looks like a good thing. I think we did this once before with a different company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| but my question is a simple one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| Are there any local companies as opposed to Lexington companies that do this same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| or they just didn't compete, they couldn't meet our RFP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| You're correct, we did this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| This is the same company that we've had a contract with for the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| There was a local company that bid on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| but when they looked at price, quality, the online service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| they just didn't match up with what GALS can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| So this is the Amazon of uniforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| That is how they're described, as a matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| All right, well, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| Thank you. We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3165)|

| 0:53:16| Did we get a motion and a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3196)|

| 0:53:36| for the former sanitary laundry and dry cleaning facility at 625 North Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3216)|
| 0:53:41| for an amount not to exceed $235,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3221)|

| 0:53:47| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| Don, Michelle, I know that we're in pretty deep on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| and we want to get it cleaned up so that we can get it back into productive use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3232)|
| 0:53:58| Is there any other entity, person, prior owner that maybe is on the hook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3238)|
| 0:54:05| for some of these cleanup costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| It sort of falls on our back with the help of EPA funding a good portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3247)|
| 0:54:12| We aren't in the cleaning business, but we've got the cleanup costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| That's correct. I'm Michelle Foster, Director of Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| This is our first stage with the EPA cleanup grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| That's why we're moving forward in order to get this property back to a proper reuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| to put it out for RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| As you noticed in the ayes when we had mentioned the background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| we had put the sanitary laundry building out for RFP before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| We ended up with one proposal, and that proposal had some information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3277)|
| 0:54:43| that was very important to us to retract it and get it cleaned up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| and we became a recipient of the cleanup grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| This request tonight is to move forward with the environmental consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| that was selected to do that first cleanup to move it back to be repurposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| I understand. Is there anyone else that could be put on the hook?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| Can we call on Ann?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| I'm sorry, Ann, you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| Thank you, Councilman De La Volpe, Ann Wallace with the Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| One of the criteria for applying and being a recipient of EPA's cleanup funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3314)|
| 0:55:20| is that there is not a viable property owner with which to task the cleanup responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3320)|
| 0:55:26| So the polluters have scattered to the hills, and we're trying to clean it up so we can reuse it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| So the sanitary laundry closed, I believe, in the 1980s, maybe even before that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3331)|
| 0:55:37| and then the property was purchased by another individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| and subsequently sold to another individual who then defaulted on the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| So based on that chain of ownership and the fact that the person who previously owned it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3344)|
| 0:55:49| prior to the city's ownership defaulting on their taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3349)|
| 0:55:52| showed that they didn't have any financial wherewithal to be able to address the issues at the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| which was why we were eligible for the cleanup grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| So if we want it productive, we've got to step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3360)|
| 0:56:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3362)|
| 0:56:03| Thank you. We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| Any opposed? The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| 12A is an ordinance amending Chapter 4, Article 2 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| so as to create a self-service beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| and to establish regulations for the lawful use of dispensing equipment by permitted establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3374)|
| 0:56:19| so that customers have the ability to pour their own beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3383)|
| 0:56:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| I want to thank Mr. Frost, Allison, and Chief Roush,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3387)|
| 0:56:34| and several others who had input into making this come to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| The poor people, P-O-U-R people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| Maybe both, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| Could be both, have been very helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| and they have a really sound plan for how this is going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| But when you pass an ordinance like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| you have to consider that not everyone will be as conscientious or diligent in preparing a self-serve operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3414)|
| 0:57:03| I can think of some places in my district and others that caused at least heartburn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3423)|
| 0:57:09| thinking that they might have a self-serve permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| So I want to thank everybody who's really worked hard to put this together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| and I'm hopeful that council will pass this unanimously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| and the poor people, the P-O-U-R people, can begin to get their building moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3439)|
| 0:57:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| Let the taps flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3452)|

| 0:57:46| or an agent of the permit holder to pour and serve beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| I'd like to withdraw this motion since we approved the pour self-serve beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| We have this covered, and so we need to withdraw this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| That's a motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3480)|

| 0:58:02| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| It sounds like they bump into each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| Well, not necessarily, but there's that potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3488)|

| 0:59:06| Either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| We'll just take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3547)|
| 0:59:08| He's got it going his way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| All you can do is go down from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3552)|
| 0:59:18| Thank you, Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3558)|
| 0:59:22| Tom McAdams, 116 Agnes Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| I'm here on behalf of the Lakeshore Park Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| We appreciate your considering this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| This will put Lakeshore Park in line with other city parks where special events are permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| including Chill Howie Park and the Knoxville Zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| It does only permit consumption of beer at special events that are held pursuant to facilities use agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3578)|
| 0:59:46| It requires either that a charitable organization obtain a permit from the City Beer Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| or that the event sponsor use a state-licensed alcoholic beverage caterer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3592)|
| 0:59:59| So it's not opening the park up to beverages just for special events under limited circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3599)|
| 1:00:05| We would ask you to consider approving this on an emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| We have a number of events that are coming up in the next month and thereafter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3609)|
| 1:00:15| that we need to finalize our commitments to these organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| Some of them are bringing their events to Knoxville for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| We're very happy to have them, but we need to be able to confirm to them that they'll be able to serve beverages at their events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3623)|
| 1:00:31| So we'd appreciate your considering it on an emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| Tom, before you leave, I think you've already answered it indirectly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| but this is a special events permit where licensed distributors are going to open a beer tap, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3639)|
| 1:00:46| It's not licensed to put a cooler in your trunk and carry beer to Lakeshore and have a party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3646)|
| 1:00:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| A charitable organization would have to have either a permit or use a caterer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3655)|
| 1:01:01| An individual, an organization, would have to have a state-licensed alcoholic beverage caterer to provide any service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3661)|
| 1:01:10| And they would have to sign a facilities use agreement with the park, provide insurance, and meet the other requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3670)|
| 1:01:17| It should be a great venue for good events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| I'd like to thank Mr. McAdams for the work he put into this, the thinking it through before we threw something out onto the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3683)|
| 1:01:31| And I know there's an exciting event that we may not want to announce that's coming to the park that is a real coup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3691)|
| 1:01:39| I probably shouldn't use that word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| But anyway, it's a great event, and this will be a real asset for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3701)|
| 1:01:45| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| Okay, so first we will vote on the amendment to pass it on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3707)|
| 1:01:53| You all ready for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| Is the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| So now we go to the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3726)|
| 1:02:07| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| Mr. McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| 12D is an ordinance amending Chapter 5, Article 4, Section 5-102 of the Knoxville City Code relative to keeping swine or poultry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3731)|
| 1:02:20| This is a real coup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3740)|
| 1:02:21| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| Okay, we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| Do we get a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| Councilman Campin, would you like to discuss this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| Well, not in particularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3752)|
| 1:02:37| I was invited to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| I believe we have two or three folks here to answer any detailed questions from council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3760)|
| 1:02:46| but basically the Botanical Garden has a distance issue with having their exemplary chicken coop set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3766)|
| 1:02:56| and they want to offer this as a teaching tool, as I understand it, to showcase how it should be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3776)|
| 1:03:05| So if you all have any questions, we're not opening this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| We already can have chickens in the city and in backyards, but the distance, I believe, is the real issue here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3788)|
| 1:03:14| and it came down to, I think, five feet or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| So don't ask me a question, Duane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| We've got professionals here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| Is it only the Botanical Garden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| If they're the only folks that want it, why not just ask for a variance there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3804)|
| 1:03:29| I don't particularly want to see it in the R1 zones and all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| Why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| Maybe we could call on our lawyer here to respond to that, if you'd like, Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3820)|
| 1:03:41| This is not the kind of thing you can have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| State your name, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| Douglas Gordon, City of Knoxville Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| This is not the kind of thing you can grant a variance on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| The property is quite long, and at its narrowest point it's about 950 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3831)|
| 1:04:00| and there was no way to work out a permit that would work for this particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3840)|
| 1:04:05| The Center for Urban Agriculture, and this is Amanda Spangler with the Center for Urban Agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3845)|
| 1:04:14| applied for an urban hen ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| but the urban hen ordinance requires that somebody live on the property where the hens are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3857)|
| 1:04:24| and nobody lives at the Knoxville Botanical Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3864)|
| 1:04:29| Excuse me, the Knoxville Botanical Garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| But we have another exception to the blanket ban on poultry in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3871)|
| 1:04:37| and that required a 500-foot setback for any poultry that is kept on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3877)|
| 1:04:45| A 500-foot setback from any road structure, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3885)|
| 1:04:50| So the board took up her request and started to question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3890)|
| 1:04:55| why did we have this 500-foot setback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| Could we live with a shorter setback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| And the urban hen ordinance requires only a 10-foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| So that's kind of how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3904)|
| 1:05:12| I'd like to mention that the urban hen ordinance is an extremely successful ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3912)|
| 1:05:17| We have close to 100 permits out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| We've had only one complaint in all these years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| and that concerned somebody who was actually feeding Muscovy ducks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3921)|
| 1:05:26| and the ducks were getting around, and that wasn't allowed by the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3926)|
| 1:05:30| But the Center for Urban Agriculture is there to teach people how to properly care for urban hens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3930)|
| 1:05:38| and so they need some hens for demonstration purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3938)|
| 1:05:43| You have your ducks in a row now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| Yes, indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| Dr. Sousa, Dr. of Veterinary Science, she was supposed to be here, but she chickened out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3948)|
| 1:05:56| Where'd you pluck that from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| Okay, enough of that. Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| I'm sorry, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| So I wanted to ask that, how many permits do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| You have to have a permit now to have hens, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3970)|
| 1:06:11| And there's 100 in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| That's approximately it, just under, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| Has that gone up or gone down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| Has that been pretty constant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| It continues to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| I wouldn't be surprised if next year we crossed over the 100 mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| So have you already built the pen on Botanical Garden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3984)|
| 1:06:30| Hello, I'm Amanda Stangler from the Center for Urban Agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| We did build the pen and the coop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| and both plans have been approved by the building permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| in accordance with the domestic hen application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4001)|
| 1:06:45| So all of that has gone through the proper procedure there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| So why can't you have a variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| Why can't you grant a variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| For a one-time exception, instead of changing the whole ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4014)|
| 1:06:58| You can't grant a variance for a use that's otherwise illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4018)|
| 1:07:03| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| Nobody lives on the property, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| Are we changing that too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4031)|
| 1:07:12| Nobody lives on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| We are zoned as agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| We are an urban farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| And so this ordinance is specific to farmland only, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4038)|
| 1:07:25| I was going to ask about the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| It is agricultural space, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| This is not an amendment to change the urban hen ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| It's actually an amendment to change the list of exceptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| to the keeping of swine and poultry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| The urban hen ordinance is just one of those exceptions to the blanket ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4064)|
| 1:07:50| The urban hen ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| while it requires you to live on the property where the hens are kept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4073)|
| 1:07:59| allows you to have urban hens wherever you're living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| And you can live pretty much wherever you want to in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4083)|
| 1:08:07| in any zone you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| But Section 5-102A3 still requires you to comply with the zoning laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4091)|
| 1:08:20| And the zoning laws allow basically the raising of chickens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4100)|
| 1:08:28| raising of poultry only in an A1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| So you still have to be A1 zoned for this particular exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4112)|
| 1:08:38| There are only two exceptions to let you have poultry in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| So it doesn't change it for every permit holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| to be able to reduce the setback from 500 to 100 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| If you have a very large property and you're zoned R1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4131)|
| 1:08:55| you cannot have hens under this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4135)|
| 1:08:59| You're not zoned A1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4139)|
| 1:09:00| You've got to be zoned A1 to get this exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| That's right. You've got to be zoned A1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| And you're not changing the distance for swine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| Mike, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| We're keeping the setback for 500 feet for swine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| Now, in addition to these setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| the board still has a responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| the Animal Control Board still has a responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| to look at the situation to see what's planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| and to deny a permit if they believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| the animals are not going to be well cared for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| or if it is a threat to human health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4177)|
| 1:09:43| But again, it doesn't affect our R1 requirements for chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| This is not a new exception for R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4188)|
| 1:09:52| Councilman Dela Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| Yeah, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| Is 100 foot what you needed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4195)|
| 1:09:57| I mean, is there some higher number that still works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| Why did we get the 100 foot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| I don't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| Well, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| Let me call upon Mr. Ronnie Neese,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| who is the head of the Animal Control Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| and in the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| Maybe that's where they built the coop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| Oh, yeah. That's where they built the coop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| I'm Ronnie Neese of 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| It's Knox County Health Department's address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| I do serve as the chairman of the Animal Control Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| The 100 foot setback was just a number that we chose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| and thought it would be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| The reason that we couldn't approve the previous permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| was because it was less than 1,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4238)|
| 1:10:41| And so we tried to get a footage that would still respect people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4241)|
| 1:10:47| So you want some separation, but 100 feet is plenty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| Some separation, but not much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| Not extensive to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| As he told you, homes have to have 10 feet off the property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| in a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| This is actually more restrictive than a residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4266)|
| 1:11:07| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4269)|

| 1:12:34| Mary C. Campus Applicant, 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4354)|

| 1:12:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4358)|
| 1:12:39| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| I guess this one gave me a little bit of pause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4362)|
| 1:12:47| and I was reading through the packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| and it looked like this area was zoned neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4369)|
| 1:12:53| which I think actually makes a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| But then if you look at it, there's gas stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| I guess, on three corners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| And I guess I'd just like to get the thoughts of MPC staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| and commission on this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| Gerald Green, Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| I'll give some background of this particular case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| and then some of the thoughts of staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| with regard to the neighborhood commercial zoning here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| A use is occurring on this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| that the Plans Review and Inspections Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| determined to be a non-compliant use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| not permitted in that zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| The option for bringing it into compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| was to zone the property to a zoning classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| which would permit the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4418)|
| 1:13:39| That's what this proposal would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| And looking at the intent of neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| and then looking at this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| the neighborhood commercial in the city is for small areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| and not the one that comes to mind most quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| even though it has a gas station on the corners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| and on Sevier Avenue where it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4435)|
| 1:14:00| So no taco near the Baker Creek Wilderness area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| Small service, basically a very small neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4444)|
| 1:14:09| This, I would put, is a community commercial area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4449)|
| 1:14:13| of higher classification than the neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4453)|
| 1:14:17| Unfortunately, the City of Knoxville Zoning Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4457)|
| 1:14:20| does not recognize a scale higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| than our small-scale neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| You go from neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| to basically our strict commercial C3, C4 zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| There is no classification that meets this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| The area has developed very intensely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| The uses there, as you noted, with three gas stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| other uses that attract passing motorists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| far exceeds what would be defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4485)|
| 1:14:49| as a neighborhood commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| Yeah, well, I mean, I'll probably support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| but it just seems like one of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| where we have planning to try to shape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4499)|
| 1:15:04| the way an area develops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| and it seems like it just missed the mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| And I think staff agrees with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| that this zoning may not be the best option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| We do not have the best option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| to address the development of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| Thank you. Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4525)|
| 1:15:26| This is in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| and I have met with the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| and none of the people in the adjacent areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| have gotten in touch to say they're not in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| The business that's there apparently is a very active business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4536)|
| 1:15:40| It's very clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| And I think also the fact that there are some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| about how it is zoned and this sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| and hopefully this will be one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| we'll take care of in the new zoning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| But again, there have been no complaints whatsoever on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| Thank you. Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| I have to agree with Stair on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| You're splitting your neighborhood commercial zone, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| and you've got a big block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| and then you just split it right in two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| The complaint, I believe, Mr. Grave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| has been the outside storage of leftover furniture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| and leftover pieces that are left behind the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| And that's the complaints I've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| And I think that's what got us here to a C3 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| is that they need outside storage, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| Yes, sir and no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| The outdoor storage was the genesis of the complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| But based on plan review and inspections interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| the entire use is noncompliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| The drop-off center is noncompliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4597)|
| 1:16:42| It's not a permitted use in the neighborhood commercial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| So if it were not rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| that use would have to be relocated to another location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| Even if they didn't have outside storage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| Even if they didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4612)|
| 1:16:53| The outside storage would not be permitted even in the C3 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| So they would have to remove those receptacles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| that are right door only have the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| Of course, they've received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| Okay, so they're going to remove all those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| because there's, you know, I checked it over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| And that's been the complaint from some of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| in the neighborhood is the leftover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| So they're going to remove all that and clean it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| They'll have to come into compliance, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| This doesn't give them the right to continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| Okay, that's good. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| Okay, thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170411?start=4643)|
