| 0:05:30| We purchased the distressed property and fixed it up to rent it and there's an empty area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=330)|
| 0:05:38| We're thinking about maybe there's like an extra acre there. Maybe in the future we could build a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| Thank you. I'll make a motion that we approve RA on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=343)|

| 0:06:53| Thank you, Madam Clerk. Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| Sir, if you'll approach the podium and state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| Thomas Krudzewski, 122 Perimeter Park Drive, speaking on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| Thank you, sir. Is there opposition to this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=427)|
| 0:07:13| I believe we have several people that signed up. If you wouldn't mind standing if you are here to speak in opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=433)|
| 0:07:19| I know we have two individuals that signed up to speak in opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| Since there are only two, after we hear from Director Brooks, I'll give the applicant an opportunity to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=445)|
| 0:07:33| and then we'll give each of those who are here in opposition an opportunity to speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| So, Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| Planning Commission recommends that County Commissioner approve P.R. Planned Residential zoning up to 4.85 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=461)|
| 0:07:48| subject to two conditions by a vote of 10-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=468)|
| 0:07:51| Thank you, Ms. Brooks. Sir, if you'd like to speak on behalf of your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=471)|
| 0:07:58| Sure. So, to tell you a little bit about this property and project, since there is some opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=478)|
| 0:08:04| The property is a parcel located between the French Broad River and John Sevier Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| fronting on the major arterial collector road, which is John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| It's a piece of property that sits between the Forks of the River Business Park and the John Sevier Corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=494)|
| 0:08:20| and is an area that both falls under the planned growth area, under the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=500)|
| 0:08:27| and as low-density residential under the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| As such, it's eligible for up to five units an acre under the sector plan of low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=511)|
| 0:08:39| as designated by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| Surrounding the property, in addition to the business park across the river, there's a church to the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=522)|
| 0:08:49| there's a planned residential neighborhood to the south, and there's some rural residential on the other side of the highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=529)|
| 0:08:55| where there are some larger estates and some more topography and geographical constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| This sliver of property, I believe, when it was planned, was designed, in addition to the parcels around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=540)|
| 0:09:06| as a transitioning land-use area, transitioning from the business park to the residential nature that surrounds this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=546)|
| 0:09:15| And as such, we've been seeking to rezone this to planned residential, five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=555)|
| 0:09:21| The property is serviced by Knox Chapman Utilities and KUB, so it has access to all the utilities, power, water, sewer, gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=561)|
| 0:09:30| It has frontage on John Sevier, which is a three-lane highway in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| and really, the property has few physical constraints for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| It's a pretty suitable piece of ground. It's relatively flat, but it's also elevated enough above the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=579)|
| 0:09:45| where only 0.8% of the property is in floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| There is more 100- and 500-year floodplain associated with it, and it's covered by a stream protection overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=589)|
| 0:09:55| which by county ordinance, or guidelines, I should say, comes with a recommendation of planned residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=595)|
| 0:10:02| So we feel that planned residential is appropriate for this specific property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=602)|
| 0:10:09| With that being the case, there's precedence in the John Sevier corridor for planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=609)|
| 0:10:16| In some cases, planned residential up to eight units an acre that are on John Sevier that are adjacent to agricultural zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=616)|
| 0:10:24| So this is clearly an area that is transitioning, seeing that type of land-use, one next to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=624)|
| 0:10:31| This property meets all of the planning requirements and guidelines for planned residential, five units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| and we feel it's a great place for housing for our community to help with the supply and demand imbalance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=636)|
| 0:10:43| and the affordability that we're seeing being an issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| When this property went before Planning Commission, it had a stream and slope protection analysis done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=648)|
| 0:10:55| and that deemed it suitable for 4.85 units per acre, and that is what Planning Commission recommended for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=655)|
| 0:11:02| With that said, we continue to work on this project and continue with design on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| and we don't look to necessarily ask for more than what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| And so in this case, based on some preliminary work we've been doing, we're comfortable with 4.5 units per acre on this specific project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=671)|
| 0:11:19| And so we respectfully request a rezoning of planned residential to 4.5 units per acre for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=679)|
| 0:11:28| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| Drew, could we get a timer at three minutes, please, for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=690)|
| 0:11:36| We have two gentlemen who have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| The first is William Roten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=698)|
| 0:11:44| Mr. Roten, if you want to come to the podium and if you'll just state your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| and I want to allow up to three minutes for each speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| My name is Dale Roten at 4315 French Road, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=713)|
| 0:12:00| This property was recommended by Knox County Planning staff on a Planning Commission representative from South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=720)|
| 0:12:07| There's only one, and they recommended three units per acre when this was voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=727)|
| 0:12:14| The statement by the planning staff said, and I'm sure you've read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=734)|
| 0:12:21| that the level density does not align with the residential character of the surrounding area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| which is primarily comprised of dwellings of one-plus acres, lots of custom-built homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=746)|
| 0:12:32| plus the Serenity River condo, which is built at a one-and-a-half per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=752)|
| 0:12:37| It did have a density of three, like they recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| Therefore, the reason why, they said, was because, of course, of the adjacent communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| and that this is roughly 30%, 27% or in the 20% to 30% range on all the properties in the stream protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=768)|
| 0:12:58| Well, if it's a low-density housing of a maximum of five per acre and you've got 20-plus percent of stream protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=778)|
| 0:13:05| how do you get 4.8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| They recommended three because they didn't want to cluster the homes together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| because you can't build on this particular stream protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| And most people think that that's a lot, even for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| So that's one thing that they recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| Secondly, on the adjacent property, which they don't have the—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| they've got to have two props together to get, I guess, an entrance to Johnsonville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| because they're so compact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| And it's a big curve, if you're familiar with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| It's a 90-degree curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| I know a lot of you commissioners have probably looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| It's a 90-degree curve, and you have no way of getting in and out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| It is a three-lane highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| There's a turning lane, and there's been numerous wrecks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| Even my wife told me her car there, because I've vouched for numerous wrecks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| And it's really dangerous in a turning lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| And if they have 100-plus houses in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| there's no way that there's not going to be many more Lifestar places out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=839)|
| 0:14:05| to get people out of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| Anyway, on the adjoining property, the same recommendation was made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| and they came back at three per acre on an eight-to-three vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| This vote did end up ten to two, supposedly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| but it started out with either one or two votes, and they had to count the votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| But Dick Graff got a vote in the second, and they voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| And when it came back as they or may in about 30 seconds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| I couldn't even understand how quick it went to 4.8 from three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| But anyway, I would love for you to abide by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| try-to-go-with-the-Knox-County staff recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| and the only South Knox for representative recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| a three per acre, and Lord knows we need the development out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| I understand that, but we sure don't need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| We need it for something that hurts the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| and we feel like that's going to hurt the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| Thank you, Mr. Rogan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| We also have Tony Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| Mr. Brooks, if you'll state your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| and you have up to three minutes to address the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| Tony Brooks, 1924 East Governor John Severe Highway, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=913)|
| 0:15:20| I'm here to ask you to reduce the homes on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| from 4.85 to one or three in recommendation by the planning review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=925)|
| 0:15:33| With one to three, like the subdivision up the street is enclosed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=933)|
| 0:15:40| it was approved for one to three, and it ended up one and a half per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=940)|
| 0:15:49| So all these subdivisions that are planned around here should be the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=949)|
| 0:15:56| don't you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| This property that is joined to this property was, like you know, one to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=958)|
| 0:16:10| How come this one is five or 4.85?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| We don't know how it come up 8.5, but that's not for me to question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| If you put all these together, it's 148 homes in that one area, in that curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=978)|
| 0:16:26| And here's some more statistics for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| The John Severe Highway always loaded from 4 a.m. to 10 o'clock in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=990)|
| 0:16:37| and from 3 to 6 in the evening with traffic from the industrial park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| which is just right across the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| And there's also a quarry, an operational quarry that sails rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1006)|
| 0:16:53| And these trucks, these tannels, 40,000 pounds moving down a hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1013)|
| 0:16:59| going east-west on John Severe Highway headed to that curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| Can you imagine a school bus stopped out there in that turning lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| to let kids out with their flashers on it, and this truck comes around the curve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| Can you imagine what's going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| Remember what happened out on Asheville Highway with that big bus wreck there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| We don't need this here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| We need to cut this down to one to three because of all the drainage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1043)|
| 0:17:30| and all the problems with that and the flood plain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| and everything that's considered on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| So I'd like for you to help in this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| and reduce it from 4.85 to one or three like everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1060)|
| 0:17:47| There shouldn't be no problem with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| because of the fact that everybody else is going one to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| How come we got five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| And that's right across the street from my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| And when they come out, there's only one way they can get out of that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| and that's in front of my driveway, which creates another problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1086)|
| 0:18:12| And French Road coming out right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| it's going to be a catastrophe if we have this many houses in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| And I thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| Thank you, Mr. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| Commissioners, are there any questions for the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1107)|
| 0:18:32| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| Mr. Snowden, the site distance there of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| is it sufficient for Johnsonville Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| It would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| Horizontally, Johnsonville Highway is designed probably at a 50-mile-an-hour design speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| There would need to be probably some clearing that would need to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| I drove through there and kind of looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| Obviously, there would be some clearing required to be done to get site distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| but I would think that adequate site distance could be obtained on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| And if there was an adequate site distance, TDOT would not let a driveway be there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1146)|
| 0:19:12| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| Before this commission's next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| there's a piece of property that was mentioned beside it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| and it looks like it is rounded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| It got passed at three, but it's a different style of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| That piece of property will go to one plot, one plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| and the driveway will come out where they will be site distance there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1174)|
| 0:19:43| This is the first time I've ran across this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| and the law director and I sat down and talked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| and Director Brooks and I sat down and talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| Whatever the density on this piece of property is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| that's the density on that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| Just because they planted it in one parcel, that does not go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1198)|
| 0:20:05| The other parcel, if it stays at three or three-and-a-half or whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| it can only be built at three-and-a-half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| I thought you, Mr. Bynum, Director Brooks, corrected me on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| The law director confirmed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| This 4.85 that commissioners came up with is the ultimate density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1220)|
| 0:20:32| that they could do under the Hilltop Ridge Topland plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1232)|
| 0:20:39| The piece of property that will come up next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| will be nowhere near this type of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| This is in the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| I'm going to follow the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| The growth plan says up to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| If we got land out there, especially this land right here, that can hold 4.5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1255)|
| 0:21:04| and I had a conversation this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| and I don't think it will build out at 4.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| When engineering gets together and roads are designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| and retention ponds are designed, it won't be 4.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| It seems like it's never what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| Serenity River, beautiful, beautiful homes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| It was at three, but that was before, I think, Dan Neal took it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1287)|
| 0:21:39| It basically went under, and Dan Neal took it over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| and he started building larger homes on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| That's why that was three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| But with the growth plan saying that it's up to five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| and the conditions on the Ridge Top and Hilltop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1309)|
| 0:21:56| and the storm and the 500-year floodplains and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| it could be up to 4.85.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1320)|
| 0:22:11| I'm going to let the other commissioners speak before I do make a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| but keep in mind that these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| and I think it's important that these two are going to come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| at some point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| and one will have a little bit higher density than the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| That's because of contour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| Thank you, Commissioner Daly. Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| Yeah, I was wondering, did you all have a meeting with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| and were there any negotiations before the council appeared?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| We provided our contact information at Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| to have the community connect with us and speak to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| and unfortunately I did not get any phone calls from any of the individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| that I gave my contact information to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| and we did speak to Commissioner Daly to hear his concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| and the concerns that he was hearing from the community in lieu of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| So we're always open to speaking to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| We prefer that. We do that on our projects if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| We did reach out also to the church property that is adjacent to the other parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| that Commissioner Daly was speaking to, and just to clarify for commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| our organization has the adjacent property under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| We got it under contract later than the property that we were rezoning here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1406)|
| 0:23:32| and we missed the deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| so we weren't able to submit them at the same time, and so we kept this one going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| But, yes, we did reach out to the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| and we provided our contact information to community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| and then reached out to Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| I guess one question for you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| I'm trying to, I guess, understand what you were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| So there's another parcel that's getting developed next to the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1431)|
| 0:23:58| Right now, as it stands, both properties are under contract by our group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| by our development company, and so the intent would be to develop them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| However, as Commissioner Daly was stating, the properties have physical differences to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1449)|
| 0:24:17| and so this property lends itself to more units, and so that's why we're seeking the 4.5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1457)|
| 0:24:25| and then we'll evaluate the other property and bring it to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| but it's not necessarily going to be exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| Okay. Do you know how many houses you hope to build on these properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| We don't know yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| Preliminary sketches, like I said, and design have us in kind of low to mid force overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1479)|
| 0:24:47| as overall density, but we don't have an exact number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| We haven't done the concept plan yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| so under plan residential we would do the concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| and when we dig into that with our engineer and engineering firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| that's when we will really be able to define the number of units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| but right now we're in the low force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| Okay. I'm complete. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| Thank you, Commissioner Lundy. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| Commissioner Daly, is this property one that was in play a couple of years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| where somebody wanted to put an industrial building on the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| Is that what I'm thinking of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| No, it's next door. That will be the one that will come up next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| Is that, looking at the drawing supplied by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| is that the one basically to the north then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| It's the one closest to the church that was a commercial company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| Okay. That was the one that was in play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| Yeah, a commercial venture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| And that adjoining property, has that already had a density set of three units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| or is that just going to be for MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| It passed this month and planted three per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| That piece of property there would probably, and Jim can correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| that piece of property probably wouldn't have an entrance for a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1559)|
| 0:26:06| The only entrance it's really got is at the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| So if it is a bind or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| the entrance would be one entrance coming in down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| or you'll have a site business both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| Right there at the church, it is in the curb at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1579)|
| 0:26:25| So that's why they've got to have two pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| Okay. And it will be both parcels we develop at the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| At the same time. That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| And to Mr. Snowden's point, this would require a TDOT permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1596)|
| 0:26:42| because it's a highway, state highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| so they would help with deciding where the entrance would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| where the most suitable spot is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| and then obviously at some point the traffic impact study requirement would kick in as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| And so that would help with, again, the design of the entrance and traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| and any safety concerns that may be a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| I do have a question for Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| What was the staff recommendation on density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| The staff recommendation on this was up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| Is there a reason why it was lower than what was requested or what the mission passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1637)|
| 0:27:24| Some of the items cited by staff were the surrounding development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| and the compatibility with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| and then the reference to the development just to the south here, Serenity River,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1651)|
| 0:27:38| as well as potential challenges with the stream protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1658)|
| 0:27:46| Okay. Thank you, Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| Mr. Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| There is a 50-foot buffer that has to be in place there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| It's a scenic corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| There was a scenic corridor study completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| and it does require a buffer from the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| So any development that would occur on this property would be buffered from the highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1689)|
| 0:28:15| by way of that scenic corridor buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| So that is correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| And then under PR, there's typically a periphery buffer or boundary as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| So under the PR zoning, there would be an envelope around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1706)|
| 0:28:32| When I spoke to you, I asked you to the property beside the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1712)|
| 0:28:38| which will be next month, I know it's next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| that the property line at the church, which is now a fence with vegetation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| you are planning to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=1724)|
