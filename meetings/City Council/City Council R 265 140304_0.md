| 0:09:03| That's a week from tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| The city will hold a public meeting at 5.30 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| and actually the location's not in my notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| Is that the depot, the southern depots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| This is for the mobile food vendors' meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| Is that right, at the southern depot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| This is to present the details of our pilot programme| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| for what we call food trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| but the law department calls them mobile food vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| As you all know, Patricio Robledo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| our business liaison, has been working on this for some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| along with Rick Emmett, our downtown coordinator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| and our law department and engineering departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| There's been a lot of interest in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| and we've been working closely with both the food truck operators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| as well as the brick-and-mortar restaurant owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| And we are hoping to get that programme launched later this spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| so we encourage everyone to come out on Wednesday, March 12th at 5.30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| for an update on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| And again, at the southern depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| Okay, and then lastly, look for the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| We got notice to proceed on the Cumberland Avenue project, Phase 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| We've been waiting on that, so we are very excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| Ann is back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| I know she's excited as well, she and Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| It's been many years to get to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=621)|

| 0:13:30| and he's done a great job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=810)|

| 0:13:54| in the development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| So once that due diligence period is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| once they've satisfied themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| that they're ready to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=839)|

| 0:14:17| They have a deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| but I know their construction schedule is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| about a little over a year, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| Yeah, they are pushing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| They're wanting to get on that site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| and get it completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| and they do think it's probably a 12-month schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| because they want that garage open to SAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| So it's an outside date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| but they're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| in their financial interest to get it done soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=875)|

| 0:17:00| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1020)|

| 0:17:02| in looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| With regard to the cost of cleaning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| maintaining that pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| and everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| I mean, how much of the $2.80| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| a square foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| that you're getting for rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| covers that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| Or do you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| a separate assessment for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| Or is that purely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| a city obligation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| Joe Walsh, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| Councilman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| the Boys and Girls Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| occupy about 40% of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| The rest of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| we've got CAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| and then our own operations going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| The pool is used primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| by Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| The Boys and Girls Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| use it two or three days a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| for a couple of hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| So, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| to answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| there's a lot of expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| related to maintaining that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| It's a large building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| And this amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| that the Boys and Girls Club pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| goes toward offsetting that cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| So it helps defray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| the overall cost we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1072)|

| 0:19:41| and we divide this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| into three separate votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1182)|

| 0:19:50| One and two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| could be together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1191)|

| 0:19:55| You really want to separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| the third one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1196)|

| 0:20:06| Okay, so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| I would secondly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| break it into two parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| Two parts is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| So we have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| to break this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| into two parts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| components one and two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| one part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| and then component three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1217)|

| 0:20:22| Okay, we will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| So we're first...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| We're on the first component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1224)|

| 0:20:31| Any discussion on one or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| I see lights on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| but I'm thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| that you're holding those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1236)|

| 0:20:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| So we have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| and a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| on components one and two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1242)|

| 0:20:46| The ayes have it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| and that's passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| Now for component three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| I'm sure Jim York's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| so before Nick invites him down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1252)|

| 0:21:06| a little more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| We made presentations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| at the budget retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| as you guys know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| for the $3.9 million investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| that we would like to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| and there is one project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| that is not maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| as time-sensitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| as some of the others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| that I want to go over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| in a little more detail with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| This was the Henley Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| pedestrian enhancement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| that included the improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| to Clinch Bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| and it really came about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| as you might recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| because we had insurance claim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| settlement money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| that we expected to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| on the Henley Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| pedestrian bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| It was about $210,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| We had proposed adding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| an additional $950,000 to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| to end up being close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| to about $1.2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| to improve that pedestrian crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| We presented a concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| and so for the last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| you know, several weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| and actually even before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| our budget retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| we were looking to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| to get better estimates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| on what the cost would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| for that particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| As you recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| there were several pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| and parts and components| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| so we presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| the overall concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| and we came back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| and looked at the real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| budget numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| and in fact, today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| I had a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| with Jeff Gallion at PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| He's been very helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| in helping me determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| what each piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| and part might cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| to this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| So when we looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| at the overall project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| we decided that there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| really three priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| we wanted to focus on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| with this first $1.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| So this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| what I would propose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| is that we prioritize it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| and start with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| the actual covering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| of the pedestrian bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| over Henley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| so it would be removing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| what's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| that metal piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| and putting glass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| over the top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| That would mimic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| at State Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| The second piece of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| would do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| you may recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| there's the plastic piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| at the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| at the corner there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| where across from the YMCA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| and the UT Conference Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| there's a plastic piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| that connects over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| to the Hilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| And of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| that would be replaced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| to match| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| what we would put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| installed there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| across Pedestrian Bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| at Henley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| And then the last piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| would be to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| the crosswalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| over to the Tennessean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| and the Holiday Inn Hotel there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| to make a connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| with the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| So we would propose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| that we start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| with those three pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| of this project first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| and that's about $1.2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| once we got the pricing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| That's what that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| So we would start with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| The one piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| that I think we all liked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| but I got the pricing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| on that today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| is the side panels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| on the bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| that goes over Henley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| Those side panels right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| look like the preliminary price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| is $650,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| So that was quite a bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| than what any of us expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| I've already gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| some information back, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| that we think there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| some really good alternates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| that are a lot less expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| that will help create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| the same kind of effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| So I'd like some more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| to investigate that part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| So with the $1.2 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| I just think it was important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| to provide some clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| that that particular project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| then would include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| what I just described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| the roof over Henley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| pedestrian bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| taking off the plastic piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| and continuing that look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| on over Locust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| and then also making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| the connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| over to Holiday Inn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| and the Tennessean eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| I wanted to ask maybe Christy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| or Jim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| on these pieces of this $3.9 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| or thereabouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| several of them look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| they really have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| a timely action aspect to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| the repairs on the fire station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| on the promenade roof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| and the 700 block of Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| I mean, they seem like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| we need to get on those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| and get done with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| The others, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| the $200,000 sidewalk improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| the $125,000 traffic signal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| the $500,000 Dale Avenue streetscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| and the $650,000 Marble Alley streetscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| I guess my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| why can't we hold off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| for a month on these approvals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| I know we talked about them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| at that retreat that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| but I'd like to see the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| or at least the draft budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| before we go leaping off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| spending those dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| or committing those dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| We may be scrounging for dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| and maybe this is for you, the Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| but why can't those await| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| two meetings or however long it takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| to get a draft look at the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| to make sure we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| spending ourselves in a corner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| That's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| So I'd like to break the package in half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| and approve the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| that got to be done now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| and then delay the others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| for a couple of weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| to see where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| That's my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| Well, it's actually going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| more than a couple of weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| by the time you get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| budget hearings and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| So what we explain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| I'm going to ask Bob| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| to explain this in more detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| but these are projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| that are leveraging other funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| and a lot of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| the projects are starting now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| or soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| and so Bob can give you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| and this is why we're asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| that we go ahead and do these now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| because they're needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| for the private part of the dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| for the projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| So Bob, would you address those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| individually, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| Why don't you go to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| It's not plugged in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| Sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| It's not plugged in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| You think we get that big?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| It's not plugged in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| Hey, it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| Bob Wetzel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| Office of Redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| Let me just kind of go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| the projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| All these projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| are time-sensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| To answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| they are time-sensitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1598)|
| 0:26:39| because there's developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| that are hanging on these dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| and in some cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| there are permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| are hanging on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| and that's one reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| we've done these at mid-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| to try to bring them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| We're glad to have this opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| because we think it's going to lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| to some real high-quality development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| I'm going to take them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| as they're listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| in your budget amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| the downtown north sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| This is associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| with the White Lily development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| which is working very hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| to be out of the ground, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| and hoping to be opened up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| sometime this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| We have a north-central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| streetscapes improvement project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| but it does not go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| from the railroad track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| to Depot Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| because of the extensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| TDOT requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| if you get close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| to a railroad track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| So we want to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| with private money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| or with, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| not private,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| with local dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| to complement the private dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| that are going to White Lily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| and we feel like we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| get this done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| get it budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| You'll have a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| and on all these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| there'll be a form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| of a development agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| for most of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| a development agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| that will come back to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| to see something on these as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| But that's what that project is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| It's to enhance the connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| from the White Lily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| up to Depot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| and back into the Old City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| and that project is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| That's the $200,000 one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| That's the $200,000 one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| The downtown street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| the Marble Alley project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| which is $650,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| those developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| are in the audience tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| We may get them to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| and answer some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| They are moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| as hard as they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| to get their financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| package together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| so that they can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| closed on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| and get started this spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| at the end of this summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| is when they'd like to get going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| We can get you some more detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| on that in just a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| but no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| that's hanging out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| This commitment is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| they're going to do a lot of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| there's a whole city block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| involved here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| They're doing a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| of the sidewalk work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| They're asking us to pick up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| some of the sidewalk work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| and this stuff is in bad shape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| If you've been down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| to look at it all around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| it's in terrible shape, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| The Dale Avenue streetscapes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| It's a Samson Sports Complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| That complex is already started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| They've done the rough grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| We've got that kind of a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| Because we're going to be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| the sidewalks down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| were designed for industrial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| Now they're going to be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| for this recreation uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| so they have to all be redone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| In doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| we've got to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| we get our grades right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| from the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| onto the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| into the pavilion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| and onto the various fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| so for them to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| These are the soccer fields?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| The soccer fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| So for them to go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| in a systematic manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| while we have this opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| if we can get this into budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| they'll be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| We have a coordination meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| with them next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| We have a coordination meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1757)|

| 0:29:19| next Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| We met with both of those groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| in the last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| trying to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| we're moving on track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| to get this investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| and to get these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| positive improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| The Dale Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| the traffic signal work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| at 17th Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| and Grand Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| that's been discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| for the last number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| As we move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| with the Cumberland Avenue project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| we know we're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| restrained out on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| so we want to offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| kind of a back way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| a more systematic back way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| into Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| coming down Grand Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| and to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| we need a traffic signal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| at that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| Our traffic engineering group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| has reviewed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| The numbers now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| if I'm correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| and if I state this wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| but they're not quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| at the level you would need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| but with the new housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| development that's coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| at the end of the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| down at the end of Grand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| and with, we think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| traffic moving off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| of Cumberland in this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| we're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| a need there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| So all of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| do have projects behind them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| There's timelines behind them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| I just am really glad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| we have this opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| in the middle of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| to come to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| and ask for these amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| rather than have to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| until the first of the summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| So since we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| this opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| I hope we can move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| Any particular questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| or issues on those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| We've got all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| Thank you, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| Any more, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| Yeah, I wanted to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| We've got a lot of numbers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| I haven't itemized all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| I'm curious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| is that for one traffic light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| 125,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| That is the estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| for one traffic signal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| at one intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| It's amazing how expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| Yeah, so my part is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| I mean, I'm not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| they're all good projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| and I'm not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| what I'm going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| but I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| do what I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| they're all good projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| and all easily supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| But none of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| are mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| in the capital improvement program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| that we've been working off of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| or I couldn't find many of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| I mean, there's money in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| for traffic signals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| but not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| but we're not taking the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| I don't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| what the process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| So is the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| as we vote on this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| is that a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| is this just to fund it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| or will we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| we have to approve it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| or is this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| I just don't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| why we're not going back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| to the capital improvement program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| and looking at the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| that are already in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| Because in that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| says it's going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| it's going to go through MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| or come as a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| through MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| and there's some guidelines in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| there's some philosophy in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| there are goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| and I don't see all those being met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| and I guess the second part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| of my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| is what would be the fund balance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| Is 3.9 enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| or is that too much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| just go back over the rationale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| how we got to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| essentially we had $10 million surplus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| and we're pulling out $4 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| for these projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| why wasn't it five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| what was the strategy on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| those are my two big questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| let's first talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| the first part of your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| and Jim York will address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| and then I'm going to ask Christy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| to talk about the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| we used to identify the projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| Jim York,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| finance director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| As we put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| the capital improvement plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| we have a variety of programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| and projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| that are very broad in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| They're not specifically laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| For example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| you cited fire station maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| We have a program for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| We don't go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| and itemize the particular stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| It gives us some flexibility to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| Respond to need as it arises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| Arises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| And the projects that we have here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| they typically fall under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| those broad categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| For example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| downtown north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| downtown streetscapes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| and downtown improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| The promenade roof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| would fall under our downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| improvements project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| at any point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| You mentioned the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| I'll refer to the 700 block of Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| We have actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| actually have work going on on that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| and it is budgeted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| under the Gay Street streetscapes project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| So that's just a continuation of those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| But this is a very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| standard practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| as we put together the CIP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| when we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| And then some projects we itemize out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| but again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| most of ours actually fall under fairly broad categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| another one that's not on this list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| would be street paving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| We don't itemize the streets that we're going to pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| but we set aside funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| in a broader category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| for street paving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| So go back to the calculations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| how you got to the exact number of 3.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| All right, now I'm going to ask Christy Branson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| I would say that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| there are a number of projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| that we could have added to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| that you all have brought to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| or that our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| or people in the community have brought to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| We tried to use some discipline on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| knowing that we were mid-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| and that as we were coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| onto the budget process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| that we'll evaluate all kinds of projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| against each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| and decide what to recommend to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| But, Chris, do you want to talk about those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| you know, the kind of two main categories?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| And we've stated them before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| but we'll state them again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| Could I follow up with Jim, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| before she starts on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| If you're okay with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| Jim, one of the things that I was looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| I'm kind of like George, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| understanding the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| Number one, all the projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| they're good projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| and I know we have a lot of other projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| but where you talk about the promenade roof repair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2117)|
| 0:35:24| at $350,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| and you say that that actually comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| under the Downtown Improvement Fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| or, I mean, that would be a part of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| That is where we're budgeting that piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| Does this mean that you're taking the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| from the 3-point-whatever-million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| 3.2 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| I mean, under the Downtown Improvement Fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| what I'm trying to figure out is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| we have a five-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| and under the Downtown Improvement Fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| it has $100,000 for 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| and then $150,000 for 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| and it goes on up to $70,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| You're adding to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| We are adding to that particular piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| Okay, and so you could tell me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| each one of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| what they fall under then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| We're not creating anything new?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| But then, when I go back and look at the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| the mayor may submit amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| to the Capital Improvement Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| any time during the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| accompanied by the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| of the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2181)|
| 0:36:22| Do we have their recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| Has this formally gone to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| Again, the MPC approved the CIP last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2186)|
| 0:36:33| and it approved those specific broad categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| It approved, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| something for downtown improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| It included something for fire station maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| It included things that fall into these broad categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| So, MPC has already done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| Did they approve the amounts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| MPC approves the projects in concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| and the amounts can be amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| during the course of the year as proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| But doesn't it say here that that has to be also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| those amendments have to be approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| I'm just asking for the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| and making sure that I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| what we have in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| Again, I'm not opposed to the projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| What I'm concerned about is that we do have a capital program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2234)|
| 0:37:20| and then there are pieces in the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| that says these are processes that we need to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| And so, my question is, item number four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| and I understand, according to the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| we have to have this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| that item number four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| it sounds as though that if we amend this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| which I would assume amending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| means changing amounts of money also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| that all we need to do is to have MPC approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| Let me say, so you're really questioning our process here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| whether we're following our own rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| and I would like to call on our law director to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| Well, I think what the process calls for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| and what has historically been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| is we send our capital projects to MPC for their review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| for their approval, for their not approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| for whatever it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| But we send them a whole group of capital improvement projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| We may ascribe a number to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| but what their responsibility is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| is not to decide how much we're going to spend on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| That's really our responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| The responsibility of MPC is to decide whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| or not this is a capital project which is worthy of being approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| or not worthy of being approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| And we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| So all of these projects that are proposed here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| are projects that fit within the parameters of capital projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| that have previously been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| And we're simply adding more dollars to these projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| so we can get them done now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| so we can get them done more rapidly than we would have done otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| That's all we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| And I don't think there's anything about our charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| or anything about our code that would prohibit us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| from changing the numbers on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| Now, if we went to a whole different kind of capital project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| then we'd have to take that to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| and ask MPC to take a look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| and tell us whether or not they approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| I've spoken with the executive director of MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| and he seemed to be perfectly comfortable with the concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| that they have approved all of these projects so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| with respect to everything that you see on this slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| And somebody just cut me off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| Was that you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| Well, then what I would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| is how each one of these projects fall under each one of these categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| In other words, I couldn't identify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| Well, Jim's got that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| He just went through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| I'm going to go down my list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| This may not be the same order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| The promenade roof falls under downtown improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| The sidewalk at Central and Depot falls under downtown north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2385)|
| 0:39:51| Marble Alley streetscape falls under downtown streetscapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| The traffic signal at 17th and Grand falls under traffic signal maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| We do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| We've always put signals under that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| The 700 block of Gay Street streetscape falls under Gay Street streetscapes project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2406)|
| 0:40:14| Dell Avenue sidewalk is under park improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| The maintenance items for Fire Station is under Knoxville Fire Station maintenance program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2417)|
| 0:40:24| And the pedestrian bridge, Clinch Avenue Viaduct, falls under World's Fair Park improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2424)|
| 0:40:31| And the reason it falls under World's Fair Park improvements is because the pedestrian bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2431)|
| 0:40:38| the maintenance and operation of that falls under the convention center budget slash World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2438)|
| 0:40:44| So, again, this would be an improvement to World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| So that's not in the capital improvement program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| It's been improved in prior years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| But not in the one that we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| I didn't see that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| Maybe I just missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| But I didn't see the World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| And where did you not see it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| In this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| It's an ongoing capital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| It's an ongoing kind of projects because we've approved it in prior year capital projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| We have lots of projects that you won't find in there that are ongoing because they were approved in prior CIPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2474)|
| 0:41:27| That's not unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| And you said the Central Depot sidewalk is which one was that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| Downtown North.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| Are there other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2508)|

| 0:41:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| And this is on the third component of the budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=2517)|

| 1:09:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| I need to let Council know that I am on the board of the Arts and Cultural Alliance of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| Greater Knoxville, and there have been several questions that have been brought up about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| organization and the amount of space that's needed and what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| So I've asked Lisa Zinney, who is our director, to give us a little bit of background about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4193)|
| 1:09:59| the Arts and Cultural Alliance and what it is we do in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4203)|
| 1:10:04| Thank you, Ms. Zinney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4204)|
| 1:10:05| Go ahead and state your name and address for the record again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| My name is Lisa Zinney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| I live at 113 Baylor Drive in Oak Ridge, although I feel like I live at 100 Southgate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4210)|
| 1:10:15| Street at the Emporium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| I've been with the project since its very beginning, and there is some history, to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4217)|
| 1:10:25| the law director's term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| Ten years ago, things looked very different on the 100 block, and the city was carrying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| a $176,000 a year burden of the candy factory, and there was a question of what do we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4232)|
| 1:10:39| to spur redevelopment on the 100 block, and what do we do to somehow fulfill the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4239)|
| 1:10:46| need that is being met in the candy factory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| So those two needs came together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| We were able to pull together a consortium of arts organizations and artists, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4251)|
| 1:10:58| been a very successful project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| There are 25 to 30 people who come to work there every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4261)|
| 1:11:06| They park downtown, they eat downtown, they have wonderful sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4266)|
| 1:11:12| We attract 50,000 people approximately a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4272)|
| 1:11:16| First Fridays are very successful down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4276)|
| 1:11:20| We have seen a lot of wonderful projects that went through difficult times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4280)|
| 1:11:26| The viaduct has turned into a gulch, and then out of that gulch sprang a new, a brand new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4286)|
| 1:11:34| beautiful bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4294)|
| 1:11:35| We were there for that, and held steady, and continued to attract people to the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| We've seen the streetscape come and go when our sidewalks were great big gulch, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4300)|
| 1:11:46| are looking forward to the redo of Jackson Avenue when we know we'll have some more activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4306)|
| 1:11:53| and we are very much looking forward to the future, what happens at the Crayla Country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4313)|
| 1:11:57| Music Park right there at the corner of Gay Street and Summit Hill, and the new life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4317)|
| 1:12:03| for the McClung slot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4323)|
| 1:12:06| So we are looking forward to a future where we continue to kind of anchor activity, continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4326)|
| 1:12:12| to draw people downtown, continue to make that block lively and attractive, and be delighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4332)|
| 1:12:19| to answer any of your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| Thank you, Ms. Denny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| We've got to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4345)|
| 1:12:26| Did you still have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4346)|
| 1:12:27| Yeah, you might just say how many organizations we deal with, and how many folks are members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4347)|
| 1:12:32| We are a membership-based organization, thank you, Duane, and they drive a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4358)|
| 1:12:39| We have over 100 organizational members of the Arts and Cultural Alliance, overwhelmingly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4359)|
| 1:12:44| non-profit organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| The Chronicle of Philanthropy says that if you have two and a half organizations for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4366)|
| 1:12:51| a population of 100,000, that you're doing pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| We have 100 organizations with a population of about 400,000 in Greater Knoxville, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4375)|
| 1:13:02| we feel very proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| We also have about 350 artists who present their work at the Emporium and who make their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4383)|
| 1:13:11| living creating and selling art, and we assist them in any way we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4391)|
| 1:13:16| They also present their work in the Mayor's Office, both the City and the County Mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| Office and Reception Area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| And are delighted to be able to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| Okay, Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| We received a revised document, I guess, as we were having dinner tonight, and it picked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4410)|
| 1:13:37| up some of the mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| It wasn't redlined, so it's not clear what all was changed, and it's too big to read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| while you are munching on a salad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| But originally it talked about the base rent being $10.22 a foot, and now it says $8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4425)|
| 1:13:53| which mathematically works out more accurately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| But on the second page of the agenda information sheet, it talks about additional charges that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4437)|
| 1:14:04| include real estate taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4444)|
| 1:14:10| And when you look in the agreement, they agree to pay the base rent, $8 and a square foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4450)|
| 1:14:17| and they agree to pay real estate taxes and common area maintenance, but the insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4457)|
| 1:14:23| is left out, and I don't know whether that's a draftsman error or whether it's somehow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| incorporated differently, but it didn't quite fit to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| You could look at $3.2, for example, rent during extension, or $3.1, but I'm wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4471)|
| 1:14:36| whether we need to add insurance in there so that the lease requires them to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4480)|
| 1:14:41| And it should certainly say, if it doesn't already, that we are an additional named insured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4481)|
| 1:14:47| And the third point, I guess, is in the resolution, it talks about we've leased 23,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4487)|
| 1:14:52| square feet within the Emporium building for arts, and we're going to lease out 28,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4492)|
| 1:14:58| square feet, and somehow we found 5,000 square feet, and I don't know where that came from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| but they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| I can answer that question if you'd like me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| Found the 5,000 square feet that we're missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4507)|
| 1:15:08| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| As a matter of fact, the original lease was for 23,000, but when the candy factory officially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| closed, we opened an annex for, and that's where the 5,000 square feet are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4515)|
| 1:15:21| That annex is used 97% of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| So it's really 28,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4525)|
| 1:15:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4528)|
| 1:15:29| It's including the base building and the annex that's next door to it or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| Yes, and it's basement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| It's basement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4535)|
| 1:15:36| And what about the, do you know about the insurance element?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| I mean, are you supposed to pay for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| Let me call on Ms. Branscombe for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4542)|
| 1:15:43| And Lance Campbell is also here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| He is our Director of Real Estate at the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| Lance and I worked on this particular lease quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| Yeah, Lance Campbell, Real Estate Manager for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4553)|
| 1:15:58| And to answer some of your questions, it is $8 per square foot is the base rate, and before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4558)|
| 1:16:03| we had an all-in rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| Our all-in rate now is $10.22, and by all-in, I mean we pay the $8 a square foot base rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4564)|
| 1:16:11| and then we pay the common area maintenance, or CAM, which is taxes, insurance, and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4571)|
| 1:16:18| Maintenance of common areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4578)|
| 1:16:19| Yeah, it's the real estate taxes, the insurance, and the CAM are all in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| That's an extra $2.22 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4583)|
| 1:16:27| So you've got that defined somewhere, so you picked it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| I was afraid we just dropped it by mistake because it's, you know, it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| I put it there so it would be plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4594)|
| 1:16:35| It should have been down on the bottom line, but it really does add up to the $289,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4595)|
| 1:16:41| It's really part of the CAM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4601)|
| 1:16:42| $595,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4602)|
| 1:16:43| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| It's really part of the CAM, you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4604)|
| 1:16:45| Well, CAM is for common area maintenance, and the insurance is a separate variable figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| When you go to the lease, you have them pay the fixed prorated share of taxes and CAM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4610)|
| 1:16:55| expenses, but not insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| So where is that covered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| Is that separately covered somehow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| I'm trying to look at the new lease that was sent out this evening, and I'm...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| The insurance is our cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| I don't have the lease right here in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4626)|
| 1:17:07| Lance may have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4627)|
| 1:17:08| But the insurance is our cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| It would be a cost passed through to us, and it's something that we would review annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4630)|
| 1:17:16| Do you pass a prorated share down to the tenant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4641)|
| 1:17:22| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4642)|
| 1:17:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| We are the tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4645)|
| 1:17:26| We are the tenant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4646)|
| 1:17:27| We are the tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4647)|
| 1:17:28| Mr. Delvaux, I think that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| I thought Dwayne was the tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| He opted out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4650)|
| 1:17:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| I guess two questions I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| The lease agreement does have an option here to renew for a period of three years and thereafter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4655)|
| 1:17:42| in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4662)|
| 1:17:43| So would we, if that came back to us as an option, would that come to us at vote, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4663)|
| 1:17:50| are we automatically granting the city the option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| We've already granted it, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| It would be granting the city the option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| But it's not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4680)|
| 1:18:01| It would come back here for the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4681)|
| 1:18:02| It doesn't have to, I don't believe, because the approval that you would give tonight would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| be for the lease agreement, and that's one of the terms of the lease agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4685)|
| 1:18:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4691)|
