| 0:19:49| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| All right. Ms. Brooks, would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| Yes, I'm just going to give a real brief overview. I know I've said it a couple of times. Amy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| Brooks, Knoxville-Knox County Planning. But this report that you're getting ready to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| is really brief. But just a reminder to this commission and those of you that are listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| that planning staff are now reviewing all applications for city of Knoxville permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| for properties within the hillside protection overlay. So staff will review each application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1215)|
| 0:20:21| for compliance with the hillside overlay according to the standards in Article 8.9 of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| of Knoxville zoning ordinance. So at each of your meetings, if we have any level ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| our staff will be giving you a very brief overview of what those are. And there is one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| on your agenda, and Liz will cover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| Hi. Thank you, commissioners. This is Liz Albertson with Knoxville-Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1242)|
| 0:20:48| I'm a senior planner. I'm reviewing the hillside protection overlay Level 1 Certificate of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1248)|
| 0:20:54| Appropriatenesses. You should have received an email with this report in it. We have one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1254)|
| 0:21:00| case this month that we're reviewing. It was at 428 Kendall Road. It was in the R1 zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1260)|
| 0:21:09| district, as well as being in the hillside protection overlay. This is just new construction of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1269)|
| 0:21:15| single-family dwelling, and the lot is 49,312 square feet. It appears to be previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1275)|
| 0:21:26| undisturbed. The applicant is just requesting to build this single-family home, and they will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| disturbing approximately 13,025 square feet. When we ran the slope analysis on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1292)|
| 0:21:38| the allowable disturbance area was over 19,000 square feet, so they are within their limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1298)|
| 0:21:46| of disturbance for that. So a COA was issued for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1306)|
| 0:21:52| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| I just want to comment. I'm really glad that planning staff has taken this on. I know it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1318)|
| 0:22:05| additional work, but it just gives those of us interested in hillside protection a bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1325)|
| 0:22:12| comfort. Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1332)|
| 0:22:18| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| Any other questions for Liz? All right. We'll move on to first item, Item Number 7. The applicant is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1344)|

| 0:22:53| residential up to five dwelling units per acre. This application will require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1373)|

| 0:25:53| Next agenda item is number 11. The applicant is Taylor D. Forrester on behalf of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| YSOS Holdings, LLC. Property is located north side of Sevierville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1559)|

| 0:26:11| The applicant is seeking one, a rezoning from agriculture to planned residential up to five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1571)|
| 0:26:17| dwelling units per acre. Staff recommends rezoning the property to plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| up to two dwelling units per acre. This application will require one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1583)|

| 0:26:41| Mr. Forrester, you have five minutes. Please give your name and your address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North North Shore Drive, Suite S700, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1607)|
| 0:26:53| 37919. On behalf of YSOS Holdings, LLC, I submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1613)|
| 0:26:59| a letter to the planning commissioners yesterday in amending this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1619)|
| 0:27:05| to change a density request up to three and a half dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1625)|
| 0:27:11| With that, we agree with the staff's report and that there is a basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| pursuant to the required conditions to rezone this property to plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| It's consistent with the area and it's consistent with the low density residential sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| There's been several recent developments and some that are proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| that are rezoning property to plan residential in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1655)|
| 0:27:41| Is opposition of the property can possibly support up to three and a half dwelling units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| This can be achieved by clustering the density into the non-hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| and the zero to 15 percent slope area on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| while staying out of the steeper hillside areas, leaving some of the forestation there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| leaving some of these mature tree line buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| The density of up to only two dwelling units per acre is simply just not a viable development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| The cost of the infrastructure will overwhelm the actual development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| and it wouldn't even be feasible by our numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| There are properties that have been rezoned within the recent years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1709)|
| 0:28:35| that are to the east and to the south that are plan residential up to five dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1715)|
| 0:28:41| and some even up to eight dwelling units per acre within the vicinity of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| And looking back and handling many of these before this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1727)|
| 0:28:53| I'm not aware of any where staff on a PR has recommended as low as two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1733)|
| 0:28:59| This commission, in fact, actually approved and it seems that the average is right around four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| And I recognize that this property presents some challenges of the steep hillside and the protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| But again, this is just a rezoning request up to three and a half dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1751)|
| 0:29:17| It does not mean that we are automatically going to be able to build three and a half dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| We have the opportunity or the permission or the chance to even try to incorporate a development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1763)|
| 0:29:29| a subdivision plan to then come back before this body on the use on review approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1769)|
| 0:29:35| Again, there's many steps that will have to be accomplished before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| But the intent of the plan residential zone is to submit a proposed development using, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1781)|
| 0:29:47| the imaginative design solutions for optional methods of land development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| Now, this is something that this type of property would be geared towards a plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1793)|
| 0:29:59| And part of that imaginative or optional development techniques would be to create clusters of the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1799)|
| 0:30:07| And these, like I said, lower hillsides, non-sloped areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1807)|
| 0:30:13| My client has represented to me that he intends to maintain as much of the mature tree and landscape buffer as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1813)|
| 0:30:21| in some of these more concerning areas, the steeper areas, and along the property buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| and along the property lines as a buffer to the neighboring properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1827)|
| 0:30:33| We request that you approve staff's recommendation to rezone the property to plan residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| but make an amended request that it be up to a density of three and a half dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| Thank you, Mr. Forrester. Commissioner Graf, I see your hands up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| Yes. My thoughts on this are that if you've been out there and looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1853)|
| 0:31:01| it is extremely steep, full of gullies and ravines and steep hillsides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1861)|
| 0:31:09| And I think that the staff has it exactly right at up to two dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1869)|
| 0:31:17| And to back that up, that's determined by the hillside protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1877)|
| 0:31:27| And if there's one plan that we really need to stick to and try not to work around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1887)|
| 0:31:35| and substitute different design standards and whatever things that we do to try and work with the developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1895)|
| 0:31:45| there's one that we've stayed with, and that's the hillside protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1905)|
| 0:31:53| And I think we need to stay with that. And that comes up at two to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1913)|
| 0:31:59| And that's where I think we ought to be. Staff was exactly right on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| I'll make a motion that we approve staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1923)|
| 0:32:09| Thank you, Mr. Graf. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1935)|
| 0:32:21| Is there room for discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| Hang on. We do have one person has raised their hand. Mr. Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1945)|
| 0:32:33| Staff, would you let Mr. Murphy speak, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1957)|
| 0:32:43| I want to clarify one point the applicant had made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| When a rezoning is allowed at a particular density, that not only gives the applicant the right to try to do a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1967)|
| 0:32:55| but also to it actually gives them the right to submit a plan with that maximum density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| So number of units times number of acres that can be considered can be clustered around and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1981)|
| 0:33:07| But the density calculation at the rezoning is actually a very important part of the consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| And certainly, Knox County Planning Advocate supports the hillside rooftop protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1993)|
| 0:33:19| and supports the staff recommendation of suggested density. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| Thank you. Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| Yes, thank you. What I had wanted to say was twofold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| I feel that if whatever density that we approve or say can be up to for a reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2011)|
| 0:33:39| the applicant then proceeds to spend a lot of time and investment on getting close to that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2019)|
| 0:33:47| And then there is unspoken pressure that we tend to approve it because the applicant has put so much into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2027)|
| 0:33:57| I know it's not what we're supposed to do, but it's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| My feeling is that because the staff usually does recommend a slightly higher density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2041)|
| 0:34:09| at least as Mr. Forrester stated, I think the fact that the staff is coming in at two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| makes it even more telling that this is a difficult site to build. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2055)|
| 0:34:21| Thank you, Commissioner. Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| Thank you. I just wanted to concur with Commissioner Graf and also note that the urban wilderness had weighed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2065)|
| 0:34:35| and said that due to the recommendation for the two per acre, that also made them more comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2075)|
| 0:34:43| So I concur with Commissioner Graf and Korbelik for all the reasons stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| Thank you. No other comments. We have a motion by Commissioner Graf, seconded by Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2089)|
| 0:34:57| Pat, can I just say one thing? This is Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| Okay, go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| I just was going to make the comment that, you know, on something like this, I would be, if this motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| I think it's probably going to pass, but I would be okay at three units an acre to let this person try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2109)|
| 0:35:17| I know that it is so hard to make two units an acre work in today's cost environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2117)|
| 0:35:23| You know, if there was a sentiment to a compromise, not a deal, not making any kind of deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2123)|
| 0:35:29| but I think that given someone a little flexibility in trying to come up with a plan that worked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2129)|
| 0:35:35| I think three would probably be something I would support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| Just wanted to throw that out there. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| Thank you, Commissioner Smith. Any other comments by Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| Seeing none, I will, we have a motion by Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2145)|
| 0:35:51| I have a question really quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| Commissioners, you all need to raise your hand in order to speak so I can see who wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2153)|
| 0:36:01| But go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| Sure. I had a question for planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| Should this pass and the developer not move forward with developing the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| would the two dwelling units per acre still stand on this parcel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2171)|
| 0:36:17| This is Liz Albertson, Knoxville and Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2177)|
| 0:36:23| If this is approved, recommended for approval by the Planning Commission at two dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| and then if it is approved by the legislative body, in this case, County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2189)|
| 0:36:35| the density would run with the property until someone wanted to rezone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2195)|
| 0:36:42| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| All right, we have a motion by Commissioner Graf, second by Commissioner Browning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2208)|

| 0:45:55| What we have here, commissioners, is 140 lot single family detached subdivision on 48.6 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2755)|
| 0:46:05| That works out to about 3.58 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| We're well under our rezoning and sector plan of up to five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2769)|
| 0:46:16| We have two access points along John Sevier Highway with plenty of sight distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2776)|
| 0:46:22| John Sevier Highway has been listed as a scenic highway, and we are complying with the 2019 John Sevier Highway corridor study approved by this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2782)|
| 0:46:35| which asks that we provide a 50 foot tree buffer along the entire frontage, and we'll be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2795)|

| 0:47:07| In all, we have dedicated over 4.9, almost five acres of land for common area for use for the community and for this neighborhood and the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2827)|
| 0:47:21| We've had a couple of community meetings to discuss our proposal, and we've met numerous times with the county commissioner out there in that area of Carson Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2841)|
| 0:47:31| And we are in agreement with all the conditions as required by staff, and with that, we would urge your approval on this application today. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2851)|
| 0:47:41| Thank you, Mr. Harbert. Are there any other members of your party available to speak, or are you the only one now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2861)|
| 0:47:47| Yes, sir. Can you hear us now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| I'm sorry, I was connected to my large screen. This is Laura Wolfenbarger, Chief Operating Officer for Perry Smith, who's sitting next to me, the developer himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2871)|
| 0:47:58| We both are residing at his corporate office, which is located at 2139 New Arrow Road, Sevierville, Tennessee, 37862.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2878)|
| 0:48:09| And David Harbin has done an excellent job in kind of encapsulating this, but just for one or two more minutes at most, we'd like to give you just a brief summary of our vision for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2889)|
| 0:48:21| We have opened, as many of you may know, a started, Perry Smith himself has started a subdivision that we started selling homes in as recently as January of this year, after having developed 35 acres approximately on the intersection almost of Coatney Road and John Sevier Highway, which is probably two to three miles from this neighborhood on the table in the agenda now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2901)|
| 0:48:47| And the homes range anywhere from 1,700, 1,500 square feet, probably up to as great as 2,400 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2927)|
| 0:48:55| And we are seeing a tremendous demand for homes in this area for this size and dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2935)|
| 0:49:02| We have seen the raising of the quality of the homes as Perry has built them to be raising the dollar per square foot in that area from $130 up to we're now selling at $160 to $165 per square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2942)|
| 0:49:18| We are seeing physicians that are starting their internships or have started their internships and residency programs at the UT Medical Center just believe that this is the part of town that they would like and need to stay in because they need to stay 15 minutes continuous to the hospital, of course, for their residency programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2958)|
| 0:49:37| We have pharmacists, young working professionals that are moving into the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| And in almost all cases, the realtors who bring those individual clients and buyers to our neighborhood are saying that they're just seeing a famine of any other houses in the community, regardless of where in Knoxville, Tennessee, that they can have people reside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2981)|
| 0:49:59| We are looking at about 60 to 70% young working professional couples in there now and probably 30% of current South Knoxvillians that are actually downsizing in their larger homes from 4,000 and 5,000 square feet down to the 2,000 or 1,700 square feet space size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=2999)|
| 0:50:19| We are doing what are really well-finished homes, I think, that everyone has been pleased with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3019)|
| 0:50:26| We have sold probably all but about, I'm thinking, 12 or 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| I'm the listing agent for all of those and on PERI staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| So the positive benefits that we see to the community is that the homes are in great need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3036)|
| 0:50:43| I have received just today three calls from realtors of individuals that are moving from out of state and are wanting that close proximity to the airport, to Sevier County for the mountains, and to Knox County for downtown work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3043)|
| 0:50:57| And they're in my absence being here at this MPC meeting coming to the development at Cherokee Landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3057)|
| 0:51:04| Ms. Wolfenberger, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3064)|

| 0:51:13| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3075)|

| 0:51:23| Ms. Kay is on and she's been unable to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3083)|
| 0:51:29| You say she's unable to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| She has been unable to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| I'm not sure if it's not working for her, but she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3093)|
| 0:51:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3097)|
| 0:51:38| Is there anyone else who would like to speak on opposing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3098)|

| 0:52:09| I think the question, at least before myself, is how well does it fit into the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3129)|
| 0:52:15| and what impacts might the development have now and in the future for the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3135)|
| 0:52:23| Toward that end, I had a question for Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3143)|

| 0:52:39| my other questions, I wonder how did that meeting go and were there compromises made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3159)|
| 0:52:46| in the interest of the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3166)|

| 0:53:10| Go ahead, Mr. Harvin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| Yes, we met with them a couple of times and showed them our plan that we provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3194)|
| 0:53:23| You know, from our point of view, I think we presented a good plan that meets the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3203)|
| 0:53:30| of the zone, meets the requirements of the use of review, and, you know, it takes into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3210)|
| 0:53:36| account what's in the area right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| So, you know, I think the plan speaks for itself and we met the requirements and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3218)|
| 0:53:44| zoning and the subdivision requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| Mr. Chair, I'll hold the rest of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| Could you hold on, Commissioner, until we hear from the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| Who's present opposing this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| Ms. Brooks, is anybody online here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3243)|
| 0:54:11| Yes, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3251)|
| 0:54:12| It's Ms. Victoria Kaye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| It appears that she might be having some additional difficulty, but that's who spoke up just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3254)|
| 0:54:21| minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| Ms. Kaye, can you hear us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3262)|
| 0:54:33| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| She must be having technical difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| That's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| You can hear me, Ms. Victoria Kaye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| Continue, please, Ms. Kaye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| Your name and address, please, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3289)|
| 0:54:56| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| Infrequently, but yes, right now we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3300)|
| 0:55:12| Yes, I can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| This is Victoria Kaye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3315)|

| 0:55:23| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| 2921 Tipton Station Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3327)|
| 0:55:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3333)|
| 0:55:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3339)|
| 0:55:40| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3343)|
| 0:55:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| Ms. Kaye, unfortunately, we're losing most of what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3348)|
| 0:55:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| I am speaking on behalf of the Secretary, but it appears that the density that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3356)|
| 0:56:03| really locating all of this is really in the shared pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| I hope the Commissioner saw those images of what the culvert looks like underneath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3366)|
| 0:56:12| Ms. Kaye, excuse me, are you on a mobile phone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3372)|
| 0:56:30| I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3392)|
| 0:56:37| Hello?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| Sometimes we are, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| Are you on a mobile phone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| I am on a mobile phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3406)|
| 0:56:53| Commissioner Phillips, can we move this to the back of the agenda and get a better connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3413)|
| 0:57:00| here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| Do you want me to call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| Mr. Chairman, can we take a five-minute break and allow planning staff to try and contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3427)|
| 0:57:20| Ms. Kaye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| Is there a phone number that I can call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| Amy, do you want to try to give her a phone number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3444)|
| 0:57:29| We'll take a five-minute adjournment recess and we'll be back at 2.33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3449)|
| 0:57:37| It's 2.33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| Let's get started on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3460)|
| 0:57:45| Commissioner Roth, you have your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| Commissioner, you need to unmute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3467)|
| 0:57:53| I was going to make a motion, but it looks like Commissioner Adams wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3473)|
| 0:57:59| But I can go ahead and make a motion if you're ready to entertain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3479)|
| 0:58:05| And what's the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| Is it only three alternative design standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| I'd like to make a motion we approve alternative design standards per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3490)|
| 0:58:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| Second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| Commissioner Adams, would you like to speak, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| I would, but I'm not sure given the pacing of the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3504)|
| 0:58:31| I have a question for the applicant just to describe the comment areas a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3511)|
| 0:58:37| That's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| We're having difficulty reaching the individual who wanted to speak in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| So go ahead and ask Mr. Harbin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| Mr. Harbin, could you speak to, you mentioned just saying we have provided common areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3529)|
| 0:58:55| Could you say a little bit more about what those are and perhaps what we're seeing on screen at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3535)|
| 0:59:01| whoever is driving, if you could sort of circle the areas or the spots that he's referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3541)|
| 0:59:21| I'm unmuted now, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| The five acres of common area is on the north side of the property adjacent to Governor John Severe Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3565)|
| 0:59:31| That would be the five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| The first thing there is the tree buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| Along that, we dedicated a 50-foot section of buffer where we'll not remove any good trees there, of course, if they're diseased or damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3576)|
| 0:59:48| So we'll be able to go in there and do that throughout the entire way to keep that corridor with trees to match the corridor study for John Severe Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3588)|
| 1:00:00| We've proposed a walking trail through that same area right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| It'll be meandering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| We'll miss the big trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| The walking trail will connect the two entrances along the northern border.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3608)|
| 1:00:15| And then also we'll have a parking area with a gazebo for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3615)|
| 1:00:26| It varies for community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| We can do something else here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3627)|
| 1:00:28| If they want something other than a gazebo, we'll be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| That'll also serve as our mail kiosk area that the post office will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3631)|
| 1:00:37| It'll be a good area for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| And what I've noticed is that people always love their dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| So we'll give a fenced-in area that the neighbors can come in and communicate with each other and let the dogs play in that area right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3642)|
| 1:00:53| So that would be the amenity package that we're proposing for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3653)|
| 1:01:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3660)|
| 1:01:05| Chair recognizes Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3669)|
| 1:01:10| I was wondering if we're going to hear from the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| We had a lot of emails on this, and I would hate to vote on it without hearing the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3673)|
| 1:01:22| This is Amy Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3682)|
| 1:01:26| Apparently, she's still trying to connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| But she had sent an email specifically about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| But right now, we don't have any opposition signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| Then I would think that we ought to put this off until the end of the agenda and try again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3697)|
| 1:01:45| I concur with Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| We've got a motion and a second here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| I concur with Commissioner Graf as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| I had only started asking questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| I was still kind of in the middle of asking questions when we had this interruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3717)|
| 1:02:03| Commissioner Corbett, go ahead and ask your questions, please, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3723)|
| 1:02:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| To the applicant, I have a few more questions, not too many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| I'd like to know whether that walking trail can be extended to the left of the entryway so that it connects to the dog park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3736)|
| 1:02:25| That's one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| Sure, we can add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| Yes, sure, we can add that part to bring it on across the gazebo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3749)|
| 1:02:35| My next question is regarding the future of Jones Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| Right now, it's a two-lane road, and I understand there will be decel lanes put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3760)|
| 1:02:46| I was a little fuzzy on the traffic report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| Is there going to be a center turn lane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| That's one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3772)|
| 1:02:53| And do we anticipate, with the heavy use of Jones Sevier, of additional widening in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3773)|
| 1:03:00| Would that clearing site area then impede in the vehicle crossing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3780)|
| 1:03:11| Yes, Ms. Corbett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| It's actually a three-lane section through there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| The Jones Sevier Highway has a continuous center turn lane right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3796)|
| 1:03:22| Part of our traffic study shows that we will at least drop that area to dedicate where it is to move into our site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3802)|
| 1:03:32| We've got multiple people talking at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| I apologize, Mr. Harbin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| Could you hold off one second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3820)|
| 1:03:41| Ms. Kaye, are you available to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3821)|
| 1:03:47| Ms. Brooks, is Ms. Kaye online or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| She is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3834)|
| 1:03:55| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| Please give us your name and your address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| Victoria Kaye, 2921 Tipton Station Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3840)|
| 1:04:07| And thank you so much for your patience with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3847)|
| 1:04:14| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3855)|
| 1:04:16| I was just calling to oppose this on matters of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3856)|
| 1:04:22| I know that they have up to five, but the way they've had to concentrate because of the obstacles on the front end, it ends up being very dense to 6.3 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3862)|
| 1:04:32| And I am really – there are several of us who are very concerned about the water runoff, and I would like to ask for a major flooding mitigation rather than just detention for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3872)|
| 1:04:43| I had sent an email to all of the commissioners showing pictures of the culvert at the end of my road, Tipton Station, in Widow French, and that backs up frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3883)|
| 1:04:56| And I'm very concerned about the increased water from this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3896)|
| 1:05:05| Can anyone hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| Ms. Barrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| Ms. Barrett, you're unmuted now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3915)|
| 1:05:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| I don't know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| But so with the widening of John Sevier Highway, there is currently not a plan in either the TIP, the Transportation Improvement Plan, or the Long Range Transportation Plan, which is a mobility plan for our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3919)|
| 1:05:36| So there was the John Sevier Corridor Highway Plan that was done that talks about a potential widening at some point, but that has not been concurred or thought about at this time with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3936)|
| 1:05:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| My last observation is that per the subdivision regulation that talks about stub-outs, I simply wanted to introduce for the record that I don't think that this subdivision would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3952)|
| 1:06:08| or stub-outs would be appropriate because the properties to the west and the east all feed onto secondary roads and not, would not likely be going through this property to reach John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3968)|
| 1:06:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| Ms. Kaye, are you, do you have other questions for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3986)|
| 1:06:31| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| I just, I was just very concerned about the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| Again, I was worried about the water runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| And I know that all the contiguous property owners were really hoping, and the developer did say to them that he would make sure that trees were on the backside, and that would be very nice if he would agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=3998)|
| 1:06:51| And I'm just very, very concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| And I just thank you all for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| I'm glad to hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4023)|
| 1:07:12| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| I unmuted myself twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| I just want to make sure that Commissioner Korbelick had gotten a chance to finish her questions because I know she put a pause to allow Ms. Kaye to jump in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4038)|
| 1:07:24| So I just want to defer to make sure she had gotten all of her questions before Ms. Kaye spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| Commissioner Graff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4053)|
| 1:07:34| This is to commission, really, or to the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4054)|
| 1:07:41| I'm not too sure that this property would have been zoned at five units an acre if it was coming up the first time, if it was already agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4061)|
| 1:07:58| But since the nursing home was to go in there, or the assisted living, and we gave it five units to the acre to accommodate that, which is altogether different from a residential subdivision the way we're looking at it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4078)|
| 1:08:17| I'm wondering if maybe this shouldn't be, instead of a planned residential, it should be in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4097)|
| 1:08:26| It should be a planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| So if it doesn't go through, the original zoning stays intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4108)|
| 1:08:36| That's just for the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| It does have something to do with this, but I'm not speaking against it or for it either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4118)|
| 1:08:46| It's always the risk we take when we listen to applicants and they give a specific use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4126)|
| 1:08:52| And we should not be looking at specific uses, but allowable uses under the zoning and the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4132)|
| 1:09:00| Are there any other comments from commission or when we go to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4140)|
| 1:09:06| I have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4146)|
| 1:09:10| May I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| Karen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| Sorry, I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4155)|
| 1:09:16| I was trying to get to the blue raising of hand and I just used my own hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| Let me explain to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| I cannot see all your faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| I'm looking at multiple screens and multiple for attendees and panelists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| So if you don't raise your hand, it's hard for me to recognize you, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4169)|
| 1:09:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| I wanted to just make two additional comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4177)|
| 1:09:42| I have the same concern that Commissioner Graf does about the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4182)|
| 1:09:49| When the plan is up, when we're looking at that on screen and you see that plan compared to everything else that is around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4189)|
| 1:09:58| it's a very stark comparison to the contiguous areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4198)|
| 1:10:05| I appreciate very much the staff's continuing to go back to the sector plan and point out that the density that is being allowed here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4205)|
| 1:10:17| or suggested here is in concert with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| But I have noted that there have been a number of community members now saying we really want to revisit our sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4222)|
| 1:10:28| that it's out of date and it needs to be revisited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| And I think that's a very important thing, and I hope that there continues to be movement around that in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4232)|
| 1:10:40| Thank you, Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| We have a motion by Commissioner Roth, seconded by Commissioner Scott-Smith to approve the three alternative design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4243)|
| 1:10:53| Ms. Edmonds, would you call the roll, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4253)|
| 1:10:58| Commissioner Uten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4258)|

| 1:11:27| Commissioner Crowder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4290)|
| 1:11:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| Commissioner Graf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4293)|
| 1:11:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| Commissioner Korbelik?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| As I understand it, this motion is only regarding the design standard variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4299)|
| 1:11:46| And in that regard, I'll say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| Commissioner Scott-Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4310)|
| 1:11:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| Commissioner Boyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4316)|
| 1:11:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| The motion carries 12-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| Is there a motion to approve the concept plan subject to the eight conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4323)|
| 1:12:08| I'd like to make a motion to approve concept plan per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| Uten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| Chair Phillips, I did want to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| I recognize Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| One of the issues that the community has raised has not been fully described by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4347)|
| 1:12:35| I'm not sure that you're not fully describing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4355)|
| 1:12:39| I'm not comfortable that he really recognizes some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| But that's neither here nor there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| What I'd like to know from the applicant is what about the suggestion made to the community that they would have additional buffering to the rear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4365)|
| 1:12:55| I'd like the applicant to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4375)|
| 1:13:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4381)|
| 1:13:02| Once again, David Harden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| This is quite a really unique and a good piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| It's one that I've not seen in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| If you look at the way we have laid out the roads and looking at the topography, there's very little grading that will need to happen on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4393)|
| 1:13:24| If you look at my road profiles, there's a few areas where you get five or six feet cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| But the rest of the time, Miss Korbelik, we are just running right along the side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4408)|
| 1:13:36| Where she had her cursor there, that was the fill area around the retention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| So I don't need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| But you can see that with a few exceptions, most of the time it really lays in good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4422)|
| 1:13:48| Where we get into trouble with these subdivisions is when we try to move hillsides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| And at that point, I'm grading from property line to property line and grading the entire site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4433)|
| 1:13:59| That won't have to happen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| We'll be able to go in and put in the road, the infrastructure, and leave the majority of the trees along the periphery of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4442)|
| 1:14:11| This is really a neat piece of property right here that checks a whole lot of boxes that's good for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4451)|
| 1:14:18| Most notably being the grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| My access points are on an arterial road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| I'm not off trying to do 178 blocks on Tipton Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| That would overwhelm Tipton Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| I'm on a major arterial with two access points with plenty of site distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| I've checked with the utilities and all the utilities are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| And they have capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| So this property really does check a lot of boxes that we look for when we're trying to do developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4482)|
| 1:14:50| So you're willing to have an undisturbed vegetated buffer easement along the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4490)|
| 1:14:57| Well, I'm not going to give you an undisturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| There may be a few areas here and there, Ms. Corbett, that we'll need to get...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4499)|
| 1:15:04| But by and large, we like the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4504)|
| 1:15:09| It adds value to the lots and it costs us money to have to remove the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| So we don't go in there wanting to remove all the trees that we want to save on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4513)|
| 1:15:19| But just the cart block, vegetated buffer all the way around, I don't think we can give you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4519)|
| 1:15:25| But I will say with the typical house that we're building and the lot depths from the back of the house to the property line, it will be around 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4525)|
| 1:15:33| So in most instances, we'll be about 50 feet of tree buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| Not always, but in most instances, we should be about 50 feet of vegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4538)|
| 1:15:46| So you're not comfortable with an unvegetated buffer landscape easement along any of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4546)|
| 1:15:55| Well, I've given you one along John Sevier Highway right there, but the rest of the area, no, we would not be comfortable doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4555)|
| 1:16:07| Any other comments or questions from Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| We have a motion by Commissioner Ross, second by Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4571)|

| 1:20:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4809)|
| 1:20:10| Mr. Ambrose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| I'll only take about 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4813)|
| 1:20:14| Mr. Murphy, you're third in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4814)|
| 1:20:15| Mr. Tipton or Mr. Ambrose, you would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4815)|
| 1:20:20| We would ask for additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| We were not planning on Mr. Murphy's time taken out of ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4822)|
| 1:20:27| And we have a lot of issues to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| And five minutes total is certainly nowhere near enough to hit all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4830)|
| 1:20:35| Well, I'll tell you, why don't you start and we'll maybe extend the time. So, if you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| to go ahead and continue, we'll add on additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4840)|
| 1:20:44| Thank you, Chairman. I'm Hanson Tipton. I live at 1515 Dunwoody Boulevard in Dunbarton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4844)|
| 1:20:49| Oaks. My property borders the parcel that's the subject of this application. I've sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| a letter that explains our position more fully and it contained photographs and video. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4854)|
| 1:20:59| tried to send it to as many of you as I could, and they're also in the case file. They show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4859)|
| 1:21:03| that our neighborhood suffers frequent flooding and the water from our neighborhood drains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| onto the subject parcel. This happens more often than the dates we've documented and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4867)|
| 1:21:12| it is happening with increasing frequency. This year alone, my property has flooded more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4872)|
| 1:21:17| than five times already. At the review meeting on Tuesday, I heard county engineering say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4877)|
| 1:21:22| that our problems are because the pipes are undersized in our neighborhood. Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4882)|
| 1:21:26| also said, quote, they may have put pipes in without consulting my department and may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4886)|
| 1:21:30| have created their own problem, close quote. If he was referring to my property, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| absolutely not true. My property lies in the city, not the county. When the city forced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4895)|
| 1:21:40| me to replace the stormwater pipes on my property, it had to be done to city code. We used concrete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4900)|
| 1:21:46| pipes larger than the metal pipes that were originally down there. And the design and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| construction was approved by the city. My flooding issues are certainly not because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| the pipes are too small. My neighborhood was built by Steve Williams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| and we have had repeated issues with flooding, foundation problems, all sorts of water problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4919)|
| 1:22:06| sinkholes. If this development repeats the mistakes that were made by Steve Williams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4926)|
| 1:22:11| and if the development is done not responsibly with careful attention paid to stormwater drainage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4931)|
| 1:22:16| it will directly harm my property and my neighbors and it will also create a new neighborhood full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4936)|
| 1:22:21| of sinkholes and flooding issues. It will cost the county significant money to address these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4941)|
| 1:22:26| problems like when a culvert had to be constructed under North Shore when our neighborhood was built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4946)|
| 1:22:31| and the Hunter property was flooding. We suggest that a geotechnical survey needs to be performed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4951)|
| 1:22:37| to this land so that we can review its results and consult with our own engineers on the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| that developing this land will have on our property. A stormwater study also needs to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| as flooding in the entire area has progressively worsened as the North Shore corridor has continued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4966)|
| 1:22:51| to develop. Development of this land will drastically alter the stormwater drainage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4971)|
| 1:22:55| in the entire area. The staff recommendation was to approve subject to 10 conditions. However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4975)|
| 1:23:01| none of these conditions appear to address the stormwater and flooding that my neighbors and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4981)|
| 1:23:05| I have suffered which will continue on the subject parcel if it is developed. Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4985)|
| 1:23:10| the applicant, has given us vague assurances that his development won't harm our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4990)|
| 1:23:14| but we've received no specific plans for what's to be done with the stormwater runoff that flows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4994)|
| 1:23:19| from our land onto his. We're asking the commission to protect our property as citizens of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=4999)|
| 1:23:25| For these reasons, we ask that you deny this application as currently proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5005)|
| 1:23:29| In the alternative, we ask that you postpone consideration of this application until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5009)|
| 1:23:33| appropriate investigation can be done, including a geotechnical survey, a stormwater drainage study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5013)|
| 1:23:39| and also until a level three traffic study is completed by the state. We've been advised by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| the North Shore Corridor Association that as a result of the Post Oak Project and Tools Bend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5024)|
| 1:23:49| there is a development freeze along North Shore until a level three traffic study is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5029)|
| 1:23:54| As you know, North Shore is a state highway. The state has appropriated funds for that study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5034)|
| 1:23:58| and it is our understanding that the study is not expected to be completed until sometime next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| at the earliest. So we would ask that it also be postponed until that traffic study is complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5043)|
| 1:24:09| regardless of when this matter is considered by the Planning Commission. If it is today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5049)|
| 1:24:13| no concept plan or use on review should be approved that does not include specific protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5053)|
| 1:24:18| for my neighbors and me from adverse effects of development on this property. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5058)|
| 1:24:24| Thank you. Mr. Ambrose, Chair recognizes you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5064)|
| 1:24:29| Yes, sir. Paul Ambrose, 2020 Rutter Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919. I'm speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5069)|
| 1:24:37| as a property owner on the downside of this subject property, the southwest side that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5077)|
| 1:24:45| constantly being flooded by water that comes from Dunbarton Oaks across this property and goes down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5085)|
| 1:24:52| across our property and causes standing water across Ashland Springs Way, which blocks our use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5092)|
| 1:25:02| of the road. This is the same water that goes eventually down North Shore, blocking travel on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5102)|
| 1:25:11| North Shore at Whittington Creek and Ebenezer. This subject property has multiple sinkholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5111)|
| 1:25:20| I think there are four. It's got a creek going across it. It is basically all rock. We just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5120)|
| 1:25:27| don't understand how this could be approached without a geotech survey that would try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5127)|
| 1:25:35| delineate all the problems that we are now suffering, even with the property the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5135)|
| 1:25:43| So that's my statement as a concerned property owner that's on the downhill side of this subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5143)|
| 1:25:50| property in which we experience flooding. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Ambrose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5150)|
| 1:25:58| I'll provide three minutes extra. Mr. Murphy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5158)|
| 1:26:07| Road. I just wanted to address, I sent an email, but wanted to address an issue of connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5167)|
| 1:26:13| to adjacent properties was brought up. The subdivision regulations have an entire section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5173)|
| 1:26:19| that deals with the street connectivity and it encourages stub outs to be made to adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5179)|
| 1:26:26| properties that might be future developed. There's no stub outs for streets or even sidewalks to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5186)|
| 1:26:32| adjacent properties here. Well, what you can see is the subdivisions that have already been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5192)|
| 1:26:36| developed to the north, they don't connect. Connectivity is good for delivery drivers like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5196)|
| 1:26:41| UPS and the post office. It is good for fire and rescue services. It's good for building a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5201)|
| 1:26:46| connected neighborhood. I really think the onus is on the applicant to explain why they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5206)|
| 1:26:53| can't do connectivity. Otherwise, the planning commission should be asking for that. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5213)|
| 1:26:58| very much. Thank you, Mr. Murphy. Mr. Ambrose, I still see your hand is up. Would you like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5218)|
| 1:27:04| have additional comment or are you finished? No, thank you. I don't need it. I believe I made my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5224)|
| 1:27:10| point. Thank you very much. Chair recognizes Mr. Harbin. You have eight minutes, Mr. Harbin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5230)|
| 1:27:21| Actually, I think Mr. Mullins is the one that will handle this application for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5241)|
| 1:27:29| Thank you, guys. Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, suite 500 here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5249)|
| 1:27:34| Mr. Harbin is the design engineer for this development and there may be some specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5254)|
| 1:27:41| technical questions that he will be able to answer as well, which is why he is on the call still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5261)|
| 1:27:48| I appreciate the comments from Mr. Tipton and Mr. Ambrose. I would go back to what staff has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5268)|
| 1:27:56| recommended with the 10 conditions subject to this property and what county engineering has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5276)|
| 1:28:04| already said with regard to this property. We're not going to make the conditions worse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5284)|
| 1:28:12| at Dunbarton Oaks when it was developed 15 years ago in the city. The stormwater regulations were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5292)|
| 1:28:20| not what they are now. We have significantly more robust stormwater regulations that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5300)|
| 1:28:27| going to have to comply with and I believe Mr. Harbin can back me up on this. We're not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5307)|
| 1:28:33| to cause any conditions either upstream, uphill or downhill to be worse than what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5313)|
| 1:28:40| We are going to be able to comply with the engineering standards and the water that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5320)|
| 1:28:45| coming off our property is not going to be increased. We have a rather large detention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5325)|
| 1:28:49| area that has been engineered with this property with regard to the potential sinkholes that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5329)|
| 1:28:56| on this property. If we are to develop within that area, there is going to need to be a geotechnical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5336)|
| 1:29:04| study performed. However, at this stage, it just simply isn't required. We have been in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5344)|
| 1:29:09| communication with the owner of the property who believes those are actually areas that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5349)|
| 1:29:14| had graded several years ago and they're not actually sinkholes. But at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5354)|
| 1:29:20| we'll need to confirm that. It's just not required at this stage. We would ask that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5360)|
| 1:29:29| follow the recommendations of staff, you follow the recommendations of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5369)|
| 1:29:33| the Knox County Engineering and approve this subject to the 10 conditions and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5373)|
| 1:29:40| alternative design standards that we've asked for. With regard to the traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5380)|
| 1:29:46| a Level 3 traffic study that, you know, this Planning Commission does have discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5386)|
| 1:29:52| with regard to planned residential developments. However, that discretion, as the case law tells us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| must be exercised within the existing standards. And as it stands, our zoning ordinance does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5396)|
| 1:30:03| require a Level 3 traffic study for this development. They have expressed opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5403)|
| 1:30:10| that this development may make things worse. However, they have not presented any evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5410)|
| 1:30:16| that we will make things worse. To the contrary, we have presented our own engineering plans and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5416)|
| 1:30:22| with the support of staff and Knox County Engineering that our development is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| to be able to comply with the existing standards and not cause any additional issues either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5426)|
| 1:30:33| at Dunbarton Oaks or downhill towards Mr. Ambrose's property. So with all that in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5433)|
| 1:30:38| we would ask that you follow staff's recommendations and approve this concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5438)|
| 1:30:45| use on review. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Mullins. Chair recognizes Commissioner Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5445)|
| 1:30:54| Thank you, Chairman Phillips. I'd like to disclose, Pat, that I visit a lot of sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5454)|
| 1:31:02| that we need to determine an actual hands on appearance, topo maps and photographs and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5462)|
| 1:31:11| always reveal everything. And I did make a visit to this property and had an incidental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| meeting with two of the property owners. I was in their yard and that meeting needed to be held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5476)|
| 1:31:24| because I was in their yard. So I just want to disclose I have visited this site. Thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5484)|
| 1:31:32| explaining. Commissioner Oden. Yeah, I've read all the staff recommendations and certainly understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5492)|
| 1:31:41| what the conditions of approval mean. And I do think meeting all requirements at Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5501)|
| 1:31:46| Engineering and Public Works would have to address part of them. I do think, though, that this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5506)|
| 1:31:54| is very, very challenging. We've seen runs at this site before. And I think that the density's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5514)|
| 1:32:02| a lot less than what I've seen in the past. So that gives me a little bit of comfort. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5522)|
| 1:32:08| I realize that we haven't gotten a design plan yet. But I'm just curious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5528)|
| 1:32:14| what Knox County Engineering's just high level take on this thing is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5534)|
| 1:32:20| You know, I always I'm not worried about any details other than red flags. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5540)|
| 1:32:26| we've got a few red flags on this one. I'm just curious what Mr. Snowden or any of his staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5546)|
| 1:32:35| think that the plan as presented can be executed. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5555)|
| 1:32:39| Is Knox County Engineering available? Yes, Chairman. We've looked at the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5559)|
| 1:32:50| Chris, a little bit kind of like what you have, just at 30,000 feet without seeing a design plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5570)|
| 1:32:56| Leo and I both think, you know, obviously being downstream, we don't foresee a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5576)|
| 1:33:01| hydraulic impacts. We are looking at the upstream water, the offsite water that actually goes through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5581)|
| 1:33:06| Dunbarton Oaks to try to alleviate some of the issues in there. So we're working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5586)|
| 1:33:13| But as far as this site particular, we don't have any specific concerns at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5593)|
| 1:33:21| Thank you. Commissioner Korbelik. Yes, thank you. I think it's pretty clear that Dunwoody has some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5601)|
| 1:33:30| major storm water issues. But the subject property is at least 10 feet lower. And their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5610)|
| 1:33:38| issues are what is going to impact this property. So I'm okay with the stormwater issues. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5618)|
| 1:33:46| confident that County Engineering will handle the runoff and not back it up even more. I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5626)|
| 1:33:55| one question for Mike Reynolds, which is, is TDOT actually denying access permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5635)|
| 1:34:02| on North Shore Drive as they do the Level 3 study? And then I have one more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5642)|
| 1:34:13| Hi, this is Mike Reynolds with the Knox-Moscow County Planning. I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5653)|
| 1:34:17| the prohibition on any new accesses to North Shore Drive. So I guess somebody else who's with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5657)|
| 1:34:26| engineering might be able to give us any idea if they know, but I'm not familiar with any prohibitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5666)|
| 1:34:34| In that event, I think that the Level 3 study is not a direct, does not prevent this applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5674)|
| 1:34:43| from moving forward. But I do want to bring up the comment that Mr. Murphy made regarding the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5683)|
| 1:34:51| subdivision regulations. And when we do come to motion time, I would like to add that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5691)|
| 1:34:59| And when we do come to motion time, I would like to add a step out requirement along the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5699)|
| 1:35:07| side of the property. If we're ready for a motion, Mr. Chair, I can go ahead and make one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5707)|
| 1:35:15| If it's related to the variances and alternative design, I will certainly entertain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5715)|
| 1:35:21| I make a motion to approve the staff recommendation regarding the variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5721)|
| 1:35:29| subdivision variances for application ASF-20-C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5729)|
| 1:35:38| Does it only pertain to the concept plan, this variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5738)|
| 1:35:44| These are, this is for the road work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5744)|
| 1:35:47| The variance is a reduction of intersection spacing on South North Shore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5747)|
| 1:35:52| between Branton Boulevard and Road A from 400 feet to 201 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5752)|
| 1:35:57| And then we have four alternative design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5757)|
| 1:36:01| Yes, sir. We have a concept plan and a use on review, and I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5761)|
| 1:36:07| what the variances apply to. It would be the concept plan, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5767)|
| 1:36:11| Well, there's three motions that are required. The first is on the variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5771)|
| 1:36:18| and alternative design. And then the second is the variant, the second is approve the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5778)|
| 1:36:26| And the third is approve the development plan. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5786)|
| 1:36:31| Chairman Phillips, if I can interrupt just real quickly, I do want to address the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5791)|
| 1:36:36| regulation comment because I did not say anything about that during my presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5796)|
| 1:36:41| I intended to, so I apologize. The applicant looked at whether or not there can be any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5801)|
| 1:36:49| connectivity to adjacent parcels. I understand, in particular, the parcels to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5809)|
| 1:36:55| There are deed restrictions that would prevent that property from being developed into a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5815)|
| 1:37:00| So, you know, we looked at it. We don't believe under these circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5820)|
| 1:37:05| that it's necessary or even something that we could comply with. So that's why that was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5825)|
| 1:37:10| included in the plan. Thank you. Mr. Harbin, you have your hand raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5830)|
| 1:37:17| Yes, I just want to concur with Mr. Melvin there too about the development to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5837)|
| 1:37:26| Thank you. Chair recognizes Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5846)|
| 1:37:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I want to make a comment about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5850)|
| 1:37:36| stub-out. I've been on this commission for 10 years and I don't think I ever remember us coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5856)|
| 1:37:43| on a recommendation such as this for this plot and requiring a stub-out to nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5863)|
| 1:37:50| I've not seen a subdivision where the neighbors would even want that between subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5870)|
| 1:37:57| And I don't think it's proper for us to do that at this point in time during this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5877)|
| 1:38:04| So, having said that, I'd like to make a motion to approve variance one and alternate design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5884)|
| 1:38:09| standards one through four per staff recommendations. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5889)|
| 1:38:17| All right. Commissioner Eason. I just have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5897)|
| 1:38:24| It's not about this first motion, it's about the concept management. I see that part of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5904)|
| 1:38:31| property is the hillside protection, but it looks like most of the steep slopes are close to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5911)|
| 1:38:38| stream that runs through the property. So, the question I have, and I can't see this on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5918)|
| 1:38:44| large PDF, is are the sections of buffer or the stream and those sections of the common,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5924)|
| 1:38:50| except for the extension, those portions of the site intended to be undisturbed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5930)|
| 1:39:02| Well, Commissioner Eason, who are you directing that question to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5942)|
| 1:39:06| I guess it's to the applicant or to Mr. Harbin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| Mr. Harbin or Mr. Mullins, are you available to respond to Commissioner Eason's comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5949)|
| 1:39:20| Yeah, I would ask Mr. Harbin to address that. I would just say that looking at the site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5960)|
| 1:39:26| that's on the screen now, you can see that, you know, the areas to the south there and the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5966)|
| 1:39:36| are, you know, the lots are significantly larger. And to take into account the stream in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5976)|
| 1:39:43| and also the topography in that area, I think that's, you know, we're using natural topography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5983)|
| 1:39:48| to benefit our detention and stormwater, the issues that we know we're going to have to face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5988)|
| 1:39:55| I'm sure Mr. Harbin can state that a lot more eloquently than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=5995)|
| 1:40:00| I'm not so sure about that, but I'll give it a try. Yes, there's a stream on-site going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6000)|
| 1:40:07| there. It's Knox County Stormwater Ordinance. We'll have the inner and outer buffer, a 50-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6007)|
| 1:40:13| buffer on either side, so that's a 100-foot swath through the middle of the property there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6013)|
| 1:40:19| that will remain undisturbed. And once we get more across the creek to the southeast there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6019)|
| 1:40:27| it starts getting quite a bit steeper. But what we've done there is we've single-loaded the lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6027)|
| 1:40:32| on that side, and that dramatically decreases the amount of grading that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6032)|
| 1:40:38| I can put that road up higher there and accommodate the lot, so our grading is not nearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6038)|
| 1:40:44| as great as it would be if we're trying to double-load the lots on either side. So for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6044)|
| 1:40:50| areas that are steeper, we're able to minimize the grading right there and provide the buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6050)|
| 1:40:56| for the creek as well. Thank you. Chair recognizes Commissioner Korbelick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6056)|
| 1:41:04| Yes, I have a question for the applicant and then a question for staff. To Mr. Mullins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6064)|
| 1:41:14| you mentioned that one of the lots to the south had a deed restriction. There are several of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6074)|
| 1:41:20| lots. Is it the back lot where it's very steep, or is it toward the front where it levels out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6080)|
| 1:41:28| Again, I think Mr. Harper may have looked at this a little more than I have. I believe we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| about the lots that are closer to the south and the east along the edge. I'm not sure exactly how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6092)|
| 1:41:41| many of them are restricted. But if you're getting into building sub-outs into those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6101)|
| 1:41:48| across the areas that are steeper topography, that also presents an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| I agree. And also...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6112)|
| 1:42:01| But I have a question for staff. And if you're tapping, I've got a woodpecker pecking on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6121)|
| 1:42:08| side of my house. My apologies. If you know how to stop a woodpecker from attacking your house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6128)|
| 1:42:13| let me know. To staff, I, being a new commissioner, I always thought the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6133)|
| 1:42:20| the concept subdivision, was where you look at things like connectivity. Am I wrong on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6140)|
| 1:42:28| No, this is Michelle. I'm Michelle Portier with Knoxville-Knox County Planning. I'm the planner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6148)|
| 1:42:32| who reviewed this case. No, you're not correct. That is when we would look at something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6152)|
| 1:42:38| Taryn, would you mind, please, going to KGIS to kind of give us a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6158)|
| 1:42:42| context on the surrounding properties than what the plan shows, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6162)|
| 1:42:50| And then back up. Yeah, thank you very much. Okay, so in looking at these properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6170)|
| 1:42:54| obviously the first three heading east from South and North Shore Drive have properties on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6174)|
| 1:43:00| They're fairly large. If you kind of look at all of them, they're connected by that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6180)|
| 1:43:06| joint permit easement, that driveway that kind of connects all of them. And so it looks like it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6186)|
| 1:43:11| part of a larger subdivision that was subdivided at one point. And so that would include the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6191)|
| 1:43:17| all those houses, they're going off screen now, the ones to the south of the property that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6197)|
| 1:43:22| talking about. Yeah, thank you. So right where your cursor is, the property with the lake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6202)|
| 1:43:29| and then the ones kind of surrounding it, all of those would have been included in that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6209)|
| 1:43:34| In fact, the property that is vacant that everyone's talking about, including a step-out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6214)|
| 1:43:39| too, that's owned by the same property owner as the property directly to the south. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6219)|
| 1:43:45| if all of these were done with these large houses connected with that JPE, I would think that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6225)|
| 1:43:51| deed restriction, we were actually anticipating that, that they would have the deed restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6231)|
| 1:43:55| on them. For that reason, they're all part and parcel of the same thing. And so if it were to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6235)|
| 1:44:01| develop, we would expect that it would follow the trend of all of those properties instead of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6241)|
| 1:44:05| trend to the north. Of course, there's no way to know that, how it would actually develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6245)|
| 1:44:10| but that's how we were looking at it. Thank you. I'm okay with not requiring a step-out this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6250)|
| 1:44:19| But my question that I was trying to really focus on is a concept subdivision is where you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6259)|
| 1:44:26| look at street layout and if you see a need or a desirability for a step-out for the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6266)|
| 1:44:35| regulations, we should do all of that and provide a reason not to do it or to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6275)|
| 1:44:42| I read it as a new commissioner. I think that's the way I read it. Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6282)|
| 1:44:48| I mean, I would have to, I guess, defer to the Planning Commission on that and what you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6288)|
| 1:44:53| your policy to be. I mean, the way that the subdivision regulations read, they are certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6293)|

| 1:45:13| The second cul-de-sac, it's really tiny on my screen, so it looks like it might say Thornberry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6313)|
| 1:45:17| Court, could have extended to that step-out, but the developer chose not to. So there's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6317)|
| 1:45:22| anything in the subdivision regulations that would require someone to extend to a step-out that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6322)|
| 1:45:28| already there. So then those instances, we end up having step-outs that go to nowhere. So there's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6328)|
| 1:45:33| the way that they're written, there's not really any criteria specific to say, okay, we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6333)|
| 1:45:38| require step-outs in this situation. Is that based on a number of lots? Is it based on topography or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6338)|
| 1:45:44| anything like that? And then another mechanism behind that to require someone to do it. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6344)|
| 1:45:49| I mean, I personally feel a little bit hesitant in making someone do something or acquiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6349)|
| 1:45:54| something that's not specifically spelled out, just because I don't want to be arbitrary in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6354)|
| 1:45:59| how I'm deciding to require it for one person versus another. I agree. And I think that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6359)|
| 1:46:06| would probably need to clarify that in the regulations moving forward. I think what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6366)|
| 1:46:11| understand is that it is appropriate, but you need to make sure it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6371)|

| 1:46:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. One other thing I'd like to point out in this discussion concerning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6383)|
| 1:46:29| step-outs, again, it's not something that has been historically required. And during the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6389)|
| 1:46:36| I think staff does a great job of analyzing the codes and the densities and the rules that apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6396)|
| 1:46:44| to these subdivisions. I think they did a great job of doing that. And I think the second guest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6404)|
| 1:46:50| then now is on the layout and design and to ask the developer to go back and redo his design and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6410)|
| 1:46:59| give up a lot or whatever you're asking him to do, to do a step-out to somewhere that may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6419)|
| 1:47:05| eventually be developed or may or may not is arbitrary. Now, I think unless we come up with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6425)|
| 1:47:13| let's go back and redo the zone that says they have to do step-outs, I just don't think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6433)|
| 1:47:19| appropriate. Thank you, Commissioner. We have a motion, a second motion by Commissioner Roth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6439)|

| 1:48:02| Before I visited this site, looking at the videos of the water that's being accumulated there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6482)|
| 1:48:09| I had some real reservations about developing this. But since then, I've spoken with engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6489)|
| 1:48:15| and got a fairly positive report that they are definitely going to look at this and try to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6495)|
| 1:48:22| up with some alternatives to help these people. There's two lofts that are really being affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6502)|
| 1:48:28| And every comment I've ever received from engineering has been proper and correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6508)|
| 1:48:35| They've always done what they've said. And given the fact that it's being developed by a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6515)|
| 1:48:41| that has a great track record, he did a development next door to me several years ago, and I did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6521)|
| 1:48:47| know him at the time. I think things could definitely improve if this does get developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6527)|
| 1:48:56| It certainly won't get any worse. And we've got eyes on this. I've been assured by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6536)|
| 1:49:02| engineering that they are going to watch this closely and try to come up with an alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6542)|
| 1:49:06| to help these people. And given all the things that have happened, I'm going to vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6546)|

| 1:54:36| not, we just don't have the roadways to carry the thing, and there's not really a possible way of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6876)|
| 1:54:45| widening, even though one of these roads, because of the situation with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6885)|
| 1:54:51| there'll be houses right on top of the road. Thank you. Do you have any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6891)|
| 1:55:00| No. Our main concern is just the traffic flow. It is horrible. And we really don't have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6900)|

| 1:55:35| our students. And buses cannot hardly stop on Brickville at all. You run the risk of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6935)|

| 1:55:51| Would you like to make a comment? Yes, this is Matt Valente. I'm at 504 Brickville Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6951)|

| 1:56:07| Brickville still has issues with flooding as well. And this property, they were attempting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6967)|
| 1:56:13| develop it, I think, two years ago, and they were going to do a traffic study. They were talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6973)|
| 1:56:17| about widening Brickville, and we don't know really whatever happened with that. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6977)|
| 1:56:21| there's still a lot of outstanding questions from that development. We don't know what the results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6981)|

| 1:56:29| if the roadway can handle this. I agree with Marcia when it comes to the schooling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6989)|
| 1:56:34| There is thought, everybody thinks that you come here and you get to go to Carter, but you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6994)|
| 1:56:38| You're to Kill Highway Intermediate, then you're Sunnyview, and then you're Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=6998)|
| 1:56:42| And the school situation, I think, is just a little bit different than what the expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7002)|
| 1:56:46| of some of the developers may be as well. The last time they said that they thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7006)|
| 1:56:53| a development of that size was going to bring in 30 kids, I think we would like to see, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7013)|
| 1:56:59| what the expectations are just so that they can have a realistic expectation, and we can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7019)|
| 1:57:03| a realistic expectation of how this is going to impact us. Thank you. Mr. Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7023)|
| 1:57:10| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7030)|
| 1:57:17| Again, I would appreciate deferring this until October. And as far as the opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7037)|
| 1:57:26| I will gladly meet with both or either of you to try to address the concerns that I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7046)|
| 1:57:34| And my email address is on the application. And again, you know, I'll gladly meet with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7054)|
| 1:57:40| either or both of you between now and hopefully October. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7060)|
| 1:57:48| Seeing no other comments, I'll recognize Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7068)|
| 1:57:55| Thank you, Mr. Chair. If we make a motion to postpone, can we do them all three in one motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7075)|
| 1:58:00| and then have three motions? I think we can. Steve, you're saying three motions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7080)|
| 1:58:09| No, you can, if you want to postpone, but you can postpone all three if you read them all into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7089)|
| 1:58:14| record. Okay. All right. Having said that, I'd like to make a motion to postpone the variants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7094)|
| 1:58:21| and design standards, to postpone the approval of the development plan and postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7101)|
| 1:58:32| what's the third one? It would be postponing the variances and alternative design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7112)|
| 1:58:38| the concept plan and the development plan. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| That would be my motion. For 30 days? 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7122)|
| 1:58:46| Seconded. Chair recognizes Ms. Korbuch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7126)|
| 1:58:53| I second the motion. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7133)|
| 1:58:58| We have a motion by Roth, seconded by Korbuch, 30-day postponement on all three items on item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7138)|
| 1:59:05| number 20. Ms. Edmonds, would you call the roll, please? Commissioner Uten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7145)|
| 1:59:12| Yes. Commissioner Eddie Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7152)|

| 1:59:49| Yes. Motion carries 14-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7189)|
| 1:59:53| Thank you. Thank you. We'll hear item number 22 next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7193)|
| 1:59:57| and after that, we'll take a five-minute break. This is agenda item number 22. Applicant is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7197)|
| 2:00:07| Crunk Engineering, LLC. Property is located on the west side of Wise Springs Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7207)|

| 2:00:39| This application will require one motion. Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7239)|
| 2:00:45| Yes. Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| And there is opposition, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7248)|
| 2:00:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7252)|
| 2:00:54| Okay. Mr. Mullins, would you like to go first? Would you like the opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7254)|
| 2:00:58| I'll just start off with a couple of brief comments and then defer the rest of my time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7258)|
| 2:01:03| following the opposition's comments. Since we were here last week, we had several meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7263)|
| 2:01:09| with neighbors virtually in an effort to address several of their concerns. I think those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7269)|
| 2:01:17| conversations were very productive, even though there is still opposition present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7277)|
| 2:01:23| Specifically, I'd like to point out, I think Mr. Murphy sent an email this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7283)|
| 2:01:30| proposing to add an additional six conditions to approval. And we are in agreement with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7290)|
| 2:01:40| five of those six conditions. I think we probably need to have some more conversation about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7300)|
| 2:01:46| proposed condition number 10, which is a 10-foot high wooden privacy fence around the exterior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7306)|
| 2:01:53| perimeter of the property. We have proposed a partial perimeter fence around the contiguous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7313)|
| 2:02:01| parcels that are closest to the neighborhood, but we don't think it's necessary to, because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7321)|
| 2:02:09| topography and the vegetation to the west and the north to fence the entire property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7329)|
| 2:02:16| And with that, I'd like to reserve the rest of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7336)|
| 2:02:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7339)|

| 2:02:45| Thank you. So here we are within the 30-day postponement. We have had to deal with a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7365)|
| 2:02:51| category change, orchestrating meetings with Acadia and meetings with the community. There| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7371)|
| 2:02:56| seems to be a lack of transparency in the permitted use in this zone and the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7376)|
| 2:03:02| of how we arrived here. In recent documentation, there seems to be an embellishment of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7382)|
| 2:03:09| community's actual knowledge and understanding of what was to take place at this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7389)|
| 2:03:15| Conditions and day-to-day operations were not available at the agenda review and were not made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7395)|
| 2:03:22| available until yesterday evening. Most of the documentation could have been provided earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7402)|
| 2:03:27| either at the Acadia community meeting, in the Zoom meeting with Acadia, emails following,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7407)|
| 2:03:34| or the initial use on review. Whether or not this facility is meeting or exceeding operational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7414)|
| 2:03:40| expectations falls within a separate corporate category, not the compatibility with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7420)|
| 2:03:45| neighborhood and zoning intent, which is why we're here. I must ask, has planning staff spoken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7425)|
| 2:03:52| directly to the Knox County Sheriff to verify concerns or lack thereof with this facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7432)|
| 2:03:59| Also, did Dr. Genovese step on the property during live firing to evaluate the potential mental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7439)|
| 2:04:07| impact? That would be doing, quote-unquote, due diligence, not relying on surveying and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7447)|
| 2:04:13| planning operations staff who were not affected, as per Mr. Mullen's document. There is a pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7453)|
| 2:04:20| taking a walkabout at this time around the property is not representative of a typical day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7460)|
| 2:04:26| at the training facility. Also, I would like to ask, has staff verified that training hours will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7466)|
| 2:04:32| remain the same and strictly Monday through Friday? The Knoxville Regional Training Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7472)|
| 2:04:38| Firing Range states they have outdoor firearms training and qualification, which is for combat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7478)|
| 2:04:44| courses. The applicant claims this is a world-class facility. We are trying to get clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7484)|
| 2:04:51| is there any other world-class facility next to a firing range? We don't want to be the guinea pig| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7491)|
| 2:04:58| for this proposed type of facility and partial security measures. The literature clearly states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7498)|
| 2:05:04| noise pollution increases anxiety, depression, stress, and the need for more medication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7504)|
| 2:05:11| Simply put, you can close your eyes, but you cannot close your ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7511)|
| 2:05:24| Mr. Chairman, thank you. This is David Leone again, 6907 Washington Pike, Knoxville 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7524)|

| 2:05:47| possible with 18 persons per dwelling. With the dwelling sharing a group therapy room, a timeout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7547)|
| 2:05:56| room, a nurse's station, and only having one mechanical room, does this sharing of rooms mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7556)|
| 2:06:03| each cottage is indeed a single unit housing 18 residents and therefore outside the realm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7563)|
| 2:06:10| of the sheltered homes for or boarding homes for sheltered care? Also, the community would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7570)|
| 2:06:17| voice that, yes, we have the detention center in our area, and yes, we have the regional firing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7577)|
| 2:06:23| range, which you just heard an example of, which we did not desire. But we also voice that it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7583)|
| 2:06:30| not mean that this community become the go-to site for additional treatment and reform centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7590)|
| 2:06:36| in the county. Should we have to continue to bear the burden of these types of facilities in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7596)|
| 2:06:42| area because we are a small or less populated area? How will this impact this community's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7602)|
| 2:06:49| future development? Will it be stifled by this treatment center? And finally, we appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7609)|
| 2:06:57| the consideration by the applicant on the conditions that have been raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7617)|
| 2:07:03| The community strongly feels that if this application is approved, the condition of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7623)|
| 2:07:08| a perimeter fence becoming a full perimeter privacy fence at a minimum of 10 feet in height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7628)|
| 2:07:16| would help provide for safety for the Acadia patients and community families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7636)|
| 2:07:21| but also could provide a positive barrier for the gunfire noise concern that's been raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7641)|
| 2:07:27| So many residents. And finally, one other concern is the proposed moving of the existing entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7647)|
| 2:07:34| to the facility. We'd like to request that a condition be added to leave the existing entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7654)|
| 2:07:41| to reduce the risk to the ingress and egress of traffic into and out of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7661)|
| 2:07:47| Current plans place moving the entrance on a blind hill, which could lead to accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7667)|
| 2:07:53| I yield the rest of my time to... Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7673)|
| 2:07:59| Mr. Murphy, go ahead. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Kevin Murphy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7679)|
| 2:08:02| 4508 Murphy Road. There are just two brief points I want to make. The first one is we did help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7682)|
| 2:08:10| write up some conditions and should you decide that this is something you want to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7690)|
| 2:08:15| it's really important to attach those additional conditions that gives some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7695)|
| 2:08:18| enforcement capability to the residents. We all know that we can say a lot of things when we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7698)|
| 2:08:25| applying, but they're written down in a condition and codes enforcement and building permits can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7705)|
| 2:08:31| actually enforce those. The second one is related to the email I sent about, you know, how this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7711)|
| 2:08:37| in front of commission. This is really putting my KCPA hat on here. This is a really tough one to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7717)|
| 2:08:44| explain to others, to community and folks, how this one is being considered as a boarding home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7724)|
| 2:08:51| for sheltered care. We're getting the right outcome, I think. We want planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7731)|
| 2:08:55| and a use on review and the ability to put conditions on it. So that's good. But that sets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7735)|
| 2:09:00| a bad precedent that boarding home for sheltered care isn't even a use in a zone. And I'm really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7740)|
| 2:09:05| concerned about that. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Mr. Mullins, do you have anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7745)|
| 2:09:11| you want to add before we close the commission? I do. I agree with Mr. Murphy. I'll go in reverse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7751)|
| 2:09:18| order that the conditions need to be memorialized. And which is why, you know, the lighting conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7758)|
| 2:09:25| that we talked about and that we agreed we could meet the Adopt-A-Road program, we agree we can meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7765)|
| 2:09:31| preserving existing vegetation along the property lines, we agree and we can meet and we've actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7771)|
| 2:09:38| submitted revised plans to that. We have upgraded the text message system and the phone message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7778)|
| 2:09:46| system to contact the neighbors. We agree we can meet that. And we've agreed to create a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7786)|
| 2:09:52| advisory committee to continue these conversations moving forward to make sure that we are good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7792)|
| 2:09:58| neighbors moving forward with the community, all those things we can agree to. Now, with regard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7798)|
| 2:10:04| the use, there's been a lot of conversation about that. I sent in an email that documented all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7804)|
| 2:10:10| conversations that I had with codes and with planning staff before this zoning was even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7810)|
| 2:10:18| solved. And that even at the rezoning, when we weren't sure if we would actually be looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7818)|
| 2:10:24| this piece of property or some other piece of property in the county, the idea of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7824)|
| 2:10:30| and planned residential zone being used for a boarding home and the definition of boarding home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7830)|
| 2:10:36| for sheltered care, that was actually discussed in February. I went back and looked at the minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7836)|
| 2:10:43| looked at the video. You know, many of the neighbors including Ms. Howard was present during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7843)|
| 2:10:49| that conversation and we talked about that. Now, we have provided a lot of information about our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7849)|
| 2:10:55| operations, information that goes well beyond what's required on a use zone review. Because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7855)|
| 2:11:00| understand this is, you know, a unique piece of property and a use that, you know, is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7860)|
| 2:11:08| that is of interest to the neighbors. And we want to be as transparent as possible. And we do take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7868)|
| 2:11:14| some umbrage with ideas that we have not been transparent because we have been and we've tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7874)|
| 2:11:21| to be. You know, the fencing, again, we don't want to be an institution like the detention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7881)|
| 2:11:31| facility, although we do understand that security is something that's very significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7891)|
| 2:11:36| which is why we have the interior fencing proposed the way we do with the additional exterior fencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7896)|
| 2:11:43| along the areas, you know, to the east and south where that's where all most of the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7903)|
| 2:11:49| are. And when you get to the north and the west, the topography and the vegetation is very dense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7909)|
| 2:11:54| and very thick. And we just simply don't think it's necessary for those areas. With regard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7914)|
| 2:12:03| the firing range, Dr. Genovese read all the information that was sent in from the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7923)|
| 2:12:11| He listened to the videos that they've sent that they displayed for you today. And he took those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7931)|
| 2:12:18| anecdotal reports at their word in reaching his opinion. He is a psychiatric physician. He's more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7938)|
| 2:12:27| than qualified to address how that would affect the clinical modalities of treatment for these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7947)|
| 2:12:35| residents. We are the ones that are investing the time into this property, the money into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7955)|
| 2:12:40| property for our business model to make sure we can provide the best services available. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7960)|
| 2:12:47| something that we have to account for and something that we're prepared to account for with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7967)|
| 2:12:52| regard to our residents. It's not a matter of whether some of the individuals would or would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7972)|
| 2:12:58| not send their children to this facility. It's whether or not we believe we can provide the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7978)|
| 2:13:04| services available with this facility. And we are convinced we can. Otherwise, we would not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7984)|
| 2:13:10| looking at this piece of property even now. I've provided letters of support from other healthcare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7990)|
| 2:13:17| facilities in the area. And I also pointed out that we just opened up an acute psychiatric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=7997)|
| 2:13:24| hospital also in Knox County. And that offers complimentary services that we believe this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8004)|
| 2:13:31| facility and that facility being so close together are of great benefit to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8011)|
| 2:13:37| We've met every standard available. We've gone through the due diligence to make sure this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8017)|
| 2:13:43| use is appropriate for the planned residential zone. Planned residential allows for duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8023)|
| 2:13:49| to answer Mr. Leone's question. Each cottage is considered a duplex. That was something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8029)|
| 2:13:55| county codes insisted upon in our prior conversations. It allows for commercial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8035)|
| 2:14:02| for property over 20 acres. It allows for educational uses. It is within that trident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8042)|
| 2:14:08| that this use fits within. And we would urge you to follow staff's recommendation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8048)|
| 2:14:17| vote for it to approve this use and review. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| Mr. Bowles. Mr. Leone, I notice your hand's up. I'll give you 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8059)|
| 2:14:26| Yes, sorry. We're on Mr. Leone's computer. This is Megan Howard. A couple things with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8066)|
| 2:14:31| the perimeter fencing. We continue to use the detention center as a scapegoat for the means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8071)|
| 2:14:39| to make this compatible with our neighborhood. So we do not feel that it is improbable or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8079)|
| 2:14:45| unacceptable for us to demand the entire perimeter fencing just as the detention center has. And also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8085)|
| 2:14:55| along with that, in our simpleton minds that we've been trying to keep up with everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8095)|
| 2:15:00| that's going on, we do have a facility or they do have a facility already being in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8100)|
| 2:15:07| built within the city zoning ordinance. And there are multiple city zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8107)|
| 2:15:13| definitions that this facility falls in. So this is not a matter of not wanting the children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8113)|
| 2:15:19| to be treated. This is not a matter of dealing with what their operations are or the minimal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8119)|
| 2:15:26| contact between us and the day-to-day operations of Acadia. It is simply, if they already have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8126)|
| 2:15:33| the means to place this with an adult facility, they already have a means to fit in to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8133)|
| 2:15:40| definition in the city. I still just don't think this is the best fit here in the county. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8140)|
| 2:15:46| think that's why we're here today. Thank you. Chair will recognize the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8146)|
| 2:15:51| commission. Commissioner Korch. Great. Thank you, Chair. I have a few questions to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8151)|
| 2:16:02| applicant. Mr. Mullins, my first question is you had mentioned in your statement that there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8162)|
| 2:16:11| 10 conditions you were happy to oblige with, with some discussion on the fencing, but I counted six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8171)|
| 2:16:19| on my notes. I'm not quite sure what the 10 conditions are. I only have the six from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8179)|
| 2:16:27| email from Mr. Murphy. Yes, ma'am. Commissioner Korbelek, I'd be glad to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8187)|
| 2:16:34| The first seven conditions are conditions in the staff recommendations for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8194)|
| 2:16:41| The additional six conditions, 8 through 13 in Mr. Murphy's email are the additional conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8201)|
| 2:16:47| referenced and then read off those conditions. So we are willing and able to comply with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8207)|
| 2:16:54| seven conditions of staff's recommendation, plus the additional conditions that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8214)|
| 2:16:59| talked to the neighborhood about, with the exception of putting a perimeter fence along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8219)|
| 2:17:07| the entire perimeter of the exterior of the property. A follow-up question. When we look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8227)|
| 2:17:15| at approving an application, we go by the decision criteria. And I believe, myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8235)|
| 2:17:24| that it's up to the applicant to determine if the impacts from outside the site would affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8244)|
| 2:17:34| his application. That is, I believe, and I might be mistaken, that it's up to the applicant to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8254)|
| 2:17:41| determine if the shooting range noise is unsuitable. Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8261)|
| 2:17:48| I do think you're correct. And I think we have complied with that condition by having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8268)|
| 2:17:54| our chief medical officer review all the literature that the neighbors have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8274)|
| 2:18:00| submitting, look at their anecdotal references to the amount of firing that is going on in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8280)|
| 2:18:09| area, and listening to the videos that they have provided, taking all of that into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8289)|
| 2:18:17| and crediting it completely. What effect does this have with the modalities of clinical treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8297)|
| 2:18:22| that we can provide and how can we address that? And that opinion and Dr. Genovese's curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8302)|
| 2:18:29| vitae is in the record to show that he is eminently qualified to give that expert opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8309)|
| 2:18:37| So, we believe we've complied with that. Now, I do want to note with regard to some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8317)|
| 2:18:45| information that was recently provided regarding firearm decibel rates. We don't contest that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8325)|
| 2:18:51| being what the decibels are for different firearms at the point that the trigger is pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8331)|
| 2:18:56| We don't have anything other than the audio that has been provided that would show what those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8336)|
| 2:19:02| decibel rates would be at the area where the children will be at the time. We have pointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8342)|
| 2:19:08| out in our submissions that from the hours of operation that were provided to me by the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8348)|
| 2:19:15| County Sheriff's Office of 9 to 4 Monday through Friday, that they will be in school during that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8355)|
| 2:19:22| time and the school building that is on the facility. And so, the sounds would be even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8362)|
| 2:19:27| further muffled. I'll also say that, you know, since this has come up, you know, I have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8367)|
| 2:19:34| out to the property multiple times as well as other representatives of Acadia and we have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8374)|
| 2:19:38| heard the firing during the times that we were there. So, I mean, the fact that it's been reported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8378)|
| 2:19:45| it's all day, every day, I think has been exaggerated. Now, I have reached out to Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8385)|
| 2:19:54| County Sheriff's Office about a log as to the hours of operation when they're actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8394)|
| 2:20:02| doing outdoor firing and training activities. And I have been told that they can provide that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8402)|
| 2:20:09| but I have not received it yet, even though it's been almost three weeks since I made that first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8409)|
| 2:20:15| request. So, but again, we have taken into account, you know, and given the neighborhood reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8415)|
| 2:20:23| you know, that they are completely correct. And even despite that, Dr. Genovese's opinion is it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8423)|
| 2:20:30| going to have to be addressed. It's going to have to be something that is fully disclosed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8430)|
| 2:20:34| to the parents, to the children. We're going to have to take into account each individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8434)|
| 2:20:39| and their specific issues that they have for treatment and address those. So, we're not naive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8439)|
| 2:20:45| in thinking it has no effect. We're thinking that it's not going to have a significant effect that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8445)|
| 2:20:51| we cannot address with regard to our treatment. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8451)|
| 2:20:58| Thank you. Chair recognizes Commissioner Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8458)|
| 2:21:03| Thank you, Chair. I've shot at this range several times. And even for a healthy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8463)|
| 2:21:11| vibrant person to be there all day, wearing ear protection, constant gunfire, automatic gunfire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8471)|
| 2:21:18| especially. And they also fire flashbangs there, which is like an inner grenade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8478)|
| 2:21:25| It's extremely annoying for a healthy person. I can't imagine placing a facility where people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8485)|
| 2:21:33| should be at a wellness center. True, they can be medicated and be calmed down. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8493)|
| 2:21:40| why introduce an annoying factor to a person who's trying to get well, already having difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8500)|
| 2:21:47| times and problems, and possibly cause medication that's unnecessary if this facility was at another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8507)|
| 2:21:55| place? No, I think this facility is needed. They're needed all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8515)|
| 2:22:01| But I don't think this is a proper place for it. It's annoying for the neighbors. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8521)|
| 2:22:09| it's just hard to support a center that I've been on and leave there all day. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8529)|
| 2:22:16| it's agitating to be under gunfire all day long. That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8536)|
| 2:22:23| Thank you, Commissioner. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8543)|
| 2:22:26| Yeah, my real kind of thing that bugs me on this one is that it's the way that this was handled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8546)|
| 2:22:35| in terms of allowing this to go in under a PR zone, I don't really think was handled the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8555)|
| 2:22:42| it could have been. I don't really agree with their findings that this is appropriate in a PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8562)|
| 2:22:47| zone. And I think in the future, it should be revisited for a facility like this to go in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8567)|
| 2:22:55| be required of a different zone. But anyway, I asked the question and the county has confirmed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8575)|
| 2:23:01| that that is the call that we are stuck with, that that has been deemed to be appropriate. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8581)|
| 2:23:08| I don't, that was my big concern. And I guess we're being told that they're sticking with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8588)|
| 2:23:14| although I still think in the future, it needs to be handled differently. So I will support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8594)|
| 2:23:23| voting for it, because the county has told me that that is the correct call in the zoning. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8603)|
| 2:23:29| thanks. Chair recognizes Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8609)|
| 2:23:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is a tough one for me as well. I think that what they're doing there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8613)|
| 2:23:42| is needed and necessary. You know, considering the gun range and that kind of thing, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8622)|
| 2:23:52| I can imagine it would be aggravating, but I'm also not a psychiatrist. So the medical professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8632)|
| 2:23:58| say they think it's okay, then I guess we have to defer to them. Having said that, I want to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8638)|
| 2:24:04| a motion to approve the development plan for staff recommendation. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8644)|
| 2:24:17| Mr. Chair, I'd like to have a little more discussion, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8657)|
| 2:24:21| Commissioner Korbelek, go ahead. Yes, I wanted to discuss both the fencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8661)|
| 2:24:30| and I was going to discuss additional landscaping. Regarding the fencing, is the motion not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8670)|
| 2:24:40| to include 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 that is introduced? Is it pertaining only to the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8680)|
| 2:24:48| recommendations? And if it doesn't include 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, I'm afraid I can't vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8688)|
| 2:24:58| I would like to add an additional condition of 14 that would extend the landscape strip that is shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8698)|
| 2:25:07| on the south side of the parking lot. I'd like to have that extended to the street to further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8707)|
| 2:25:14| protect and visually buffer the homes in those back lots, which are not yet built on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8714)|
| 2:25:22| from the parking lot light and glare. Those are my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8722)|
| 2:25:30| Commissioner Smith, Eddie Smith. Mr. Chairman, this is a question for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8730)|
| 2:25:35| Commissioner who made the motion. Would he be willing to change his motion to include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8735)|
| 2:25:40| those conditions 8 through 13 in addition to the staff recommendations that the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8740)|
| 2:25:45| has indicated they are willing to comply with that Mr. Murphy did submit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8745)|
| 2:25:53| I will amend my recommendation to include those things that they recommended that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8753)|
| 2:26:00| they negotiated between them. That's what I'll say. I don't think we were negotiating with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8760)|
| 2:26:07| with the proposer, but that those things they agree with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8767)|
| 2:26:13| opposition and the proposer agreed to. I'll amend my motion to include those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8773)|
| 2:26:22| Commissioner Roth, can I just be clear on that? Because condition number 10 was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8782)|
| 2:26:27| entire perimeter fence. And that was the one condition that was proposed that we did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8787)|
| 2:26:33| agree to. We agreed to the condition of the partial perimeter fence that was in the exhibit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8793)|
| 2:26:39| that we produced. I just want to make sure that we're all on the same page on that issue. And if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8799)|
| 2:26:45| we need to have more conversation, I'll welcome it. Yeah, my motion to be clear, for 8, 9, 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8805)|
| 2:26:52| 12 and 13 then. Correct. That's my motion. My motion as amended would be to include those items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8812)|
| 2:26:59| that the opposition and the proposer agreed upon and not include item number 10 with perimeter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8819)|
| 2:27:07| fence. Commissioner Browning, are you no perimeter fence? Just like the staff recommendation in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8827)|
| 2:27:22| motion. What? What? Nobody knows what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8842)|
| 2:27:26| Nobody knows what I'm saying. Oh, I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8846)|
| 2:27:32| Mike. Okay. Hey, Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8852)|
| 2:27:38| Commissioner Roth, do you want to repeat your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8858)|
| 2:27:41| I don't have the additional items that I don't have them before me. I know what they included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8861)|
| 2:27:49| and that they agreed on, but I don't have them before me. So I could include them in a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8869)|
| 2:27:54| Is there a way staff could bring that up? And I'll be glad to include them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8874)|
| 2:28:02| This is Amy. Let me see if I can share my screen. I can share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8882)|
| 2:28:05| Mr. Murphy's email. Would that be helpful? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8885)|
| 2:28:09| Let me see if I can manage to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8889)|
| 2:28:11| Because I didn't write them down, I didn't have them before me in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8891)|
| 2:28:25| Commissioners, can you see Mr. Murphy's email? Okay. Let me restate my motion. I'm making a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8905)|
| 2:28:34| motion to approve the development plan for staff recommendations, which includes the seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8914)|
| 2:28:42| conditions, and then adding Mr. Murphy's condition number eight, number nine, number 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8922)|
| 2:28:50| 12, and 13, and excluding number 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8930)|
| 2:28:58| You heard Commissioner Roth's motion. Commissioner Browning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8938)|
| 2:29:04| are you comfortable with your second? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8944)|
| 2:29:07| All right. Yeah. Can I ask a quick question regarding the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8947)|
| 2:29:16| Commissioner Graf's next. Yes. I just wanted to make a comment that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8956)|
| 2:29:23| if we're conditioning something with 12 conditions, it seems to me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8963)|
| 2:29:30| it's got to be a little shaky if it's not very clean cut that what we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8970)|
| 2:29:39| where we're having to condition this, that, and something else. And we have a firsthand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8979)|
| 2:29:49| one of our commissioners has spent the day there and agrees that for a healthy person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8989)|
| 2:29:58| the gunfire is not a good thing. And how would it apply to somebody that's there for treatment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=8998)|
| 2:30:06| I just think we're headed in the wrong direction on this. That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=9006)|
| 2:30:12| Thank you, Commissioner. Commissioner DeDek. I would agree with Commissioner Graf about the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=9012)|
| 2:30:18| that if we're adding that many conditions, it's a little questionable. I think that there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=9018)|
| 2:30:23| need for this type of facility in Knoxville and a lot of different places. But I couldn't imagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=9023)|
| 2:30:31| being sedated on a regular basis in order to continue my treatment just because of gunfire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=9031)|
| 2:30:37| I also want to say that the applicant presented a plan where he highlighted where he would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=9037)|
| 2:30:43| willing to add permanent fencing. And the staff conditions don't mention that. And he did not want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=9043)|
| 2:30:52| to agree to item 10 that Kevin Murphy submitted for full perimeter fencing. But if this was going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=9052)|
| 2:31:00| to be a motion being made, at least the highlighted portion that they originally agreed to needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=9060)|
| 2:31:06| the 13th condition. And I would agree with that, Commissioner Dent, if I could just jump in real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=9066)|
| 2:31:13| quick. That was something I was concerned about. And Mr. Commissioner Graf, to your point, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=9073)|
| 2:31:20| additional conditions that we're adding to this that go beyond staff's conditions, which are fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=9080)|
| 2:31:26| run-of-the-mill ordinary for a planned residential zone, even something like this, those were we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=9086)|
| 2:31:32| negotiating with the community. We intend to do them whether or not they're conditions. We agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=9092)|
| 2:31:37| for them to be conditions at Mr. Murphy's request to make sure that they are enforceable. So I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=9097)|
| 2:31:42| think it's we're trying to squeeze something in that's not proper. I just think we're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=9102)|
| 2:31:48| show good faith that we're willing to put our money where our mouth is with regard to things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=9108)|
| 2:31:52| we already intend to do. All right. We've got a motion by Commissioner Ross,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=9112)|
| 2:32:01| seconded by Commissioner Browning. Ms. Edmond, would you call the roll, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=9121)|

| 2:33:12| I'm sorry. I just wanted to confirm that that is a yes from Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=9192)|
| 2:33:16| Yes. Yes, it is. Okay. Commissioner Boyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200910?start=9196)|
