| 0:00:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=45)|
| 0:00:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=46)|
| 0:00:47| Therefore, in the future, any items to be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=47)|
| 0:00:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=48)|
| 0:00:49| Items for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=49)|
| 0:00:50| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=50)|
| 0:00:51| Mr. Mayor, I would like to move to postpone Item 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=51)|
| 0:00:52| This has to do with the adoption of the Hillside and Ridgetop Preservation Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=52)|
| 0:00:53| And I'd like to call on former Councilman Joe Holquist, who helped to convene this task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=53)|
| 0:00:59| course and was the co-chairman to offer a bit of explanation about that and I'll give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=59)|
| 0:01:04| a number of ways to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=64)|
| 0:01:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=66)|
| 0:01:07| Okay, it's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=67)|
| 0:01:10| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=70)|
| 0:01:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=71)|
| 0:01:12| Oh, you want to recognize Hulkers, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=72)|
| 0:01:15| And you have to postpone it to a date certain too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=75)|
| 0:01:19| Thank you, Mayor, Councilman Roddy, and council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=79)|
| 0:01:25| Causes some last minute controversy that's come up about this and I know having been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=85)|
| 0:01:31| on council, I know it, you all have seen it, where you'll go through a long public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=91)|
| 0:01:38| and then some people won't engage until the very end when it comes to the legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=98)|
| 0:01:43| step and I'm not sure whose fault that is, but that's where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=103)|
| 0:01:48| So we want to make sure that the voices that have arisen at the last moment can also be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=108)|
| 0:01:55| heard and we can dialogue with them and address their concerns in a reasonable manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=115)|
| 0:02:02| Hopefully that will be a workshop, but that's your all's decision as to whether you're willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=122)|
| 0:02:05| to do another workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=125)|
| 0:02:07| But I know that Susan Wilson sent out three possible dates and I apologize I don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| those in front of me, but I believe one of them was, the latest of those was mid-March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=132)|
| 0:02:19| so that would probably mean we'd need to postpone until the March 22nd meeting for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=139)|
| 0:02:26| first reading, if that's all right with council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=146)|
| 0:02:29| So I'd propose a six-week postponement, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=149)|
| 0:02:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| That's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| Ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=161)|
| 0:02:43| Thank you, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=163)|
| 0:02:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=165)|
| 0:02:47| I wonder if we could ask Mr. Hulquist, will you make sure that the people that want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| be heard at the last minute come to the workshop so they will be heard and not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| I cannot control what they do, Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=175)|
| 0:02:58| Can you get word out to them somehow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| Oh, we will absolutely do that and encourage them to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| We're in dialogue with them now and we will continue to do that and be in dialogue with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=183)|
| 0:03:07| them and encourage them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=187)|
| 0:03:09| And I would be very surprised if they don't come to the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=189)|
| 0:03:13| Because if they don't, that sends a message to you all, too, that they're not that interested in talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| So I think they'll come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| Thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| I want to make a chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| I'd like to make a motion to postpone Item 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| Let's postpone it at least 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=212)|
| 0:03:38| Yes, four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| That would give us a chance to get all the information on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=220)|
| 0:03:44| We've got anybody here that perhaps may want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| Is there anyone here that wants to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| If you'd come down and give your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| I'm Karen Williamson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| I live at 637 Arrowhead Trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| I'm here on behalf of Jim Sarai tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=240)|
| 0:04:06| Why was the motion to postpone because he's not here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| Well, some of the neighborhood organizations have contacted me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| It's in my district, and they really don't have very much information on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| So we need to have some time where we can study it and find out just what is being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=257)|
| 0:04:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| Well, perhaps I could speak to that for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| I'd appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| Should I go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=268)|
| 0:04:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| I am just here on behalf of the owner personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| You can speak just to the postponement only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| I'd appreciate it if we went ahead and discussed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=281)|
| 0:04:44| Could I make a motion to suspend the rules to where I'd like to hear a little bit about what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=284)|
| 0:04:50| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| So audit, and you can go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| You have five minutes, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| I didn't mean to speak out of term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| I am here for Jim tonight just to discuss a little bit about what he's doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| and I'm just going to sort of go over a couple of informational bits he sent me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=312)|
| 0:05:20| He purchased the standard knitting mill several years ago when it was Delta Manufacturing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=320)|
| 0:05:29| and discussed the situation with city administration at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=329)|
| 0:05:35| The initial plan was for plus or minus 200 residential units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=335)|
| 0:05:39| some light commercial in the rear along the railroad with indoor parking to buffer that noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=339)|
| 0:05:47| It would involve a couple million dollars of city funding as well as a partnership with perhaps KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=347)|
| 0:05:55| The units would wrap the ball field side of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=355)|
| 0:05:59| and hopefully spur some additional investment in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| The projected redevelopment cost at the time was 30 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| Unfortunately, with the financial crash of 07, which sort of is still feeling that now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=368)|
| 0:06:16| the city contribution would have needed to be increased, and so the deal was tabled at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=376)|
| 0:06:23| In that time, the owner has spent over a quarter of a million securing the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| paying taxes, worked with the local police department to keep the vagrants out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| and the local police has also used that site for training missions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=392)|
| 0:06:38| The good news at this point is that there appears to be a source of funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| that could help redevelop this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| The important thing is, in my opinion, and that's personal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| that it would help put this building back on the tax roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| The project we're asking to change the zoning from industrial to commercial C2, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=415)|
| 0:07:06| So in a nutshell, the plan is for plus or minus 120 residential apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=426)|
| 0:07:14| 80 to 90 of them would be financed with affordable housing tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| The remaining units would do market rate and will occupy the top floor of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=438)|
| 0:07:24| The railroad side, like I said, would be light commercial and indoor parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| and the current development costs are estimated around 25 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| The affordable tax credit application has to be submitted in March of 2011, which is why I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=453)|
| 0:07:40| Instead of postponing, I'm asking that we could move this forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| so that we can go ahead and move into design to make this a working class housing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=465)|
| 0:07:53| With rents, we're hoping an average of $500 to $700 range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| and the market rate units projected to be in the $700 to $900 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=477)|
| 0:08:03| The general contractor would probably come from North Carolina, which is where the owner is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=483)|
| 0:08:09| but he hopes to use local subs, so that's going to help generate some work for our local trades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=489)|
| 0:08:16| And his general comments are that the economic effects would be tremendous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| in terms of being able to put the property back on tax rolls would give you about $150,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=500)|
| 0:08:27| On top of, you know, you're going to have 120 new utility users,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=507)|
| 0:08:34| and then if there is commercial added to the project, you're going to have revenues from that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=514)|
| 0:08:41| And the important thing is just breathing life back into that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| It's an eyesore right now, and it could really, really be a fantastic piece of architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=525)|
| 0:08:52| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| Shall I sit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| Shall I sit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| Unless someone – oh, Councilman Dellavopia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| Just one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| We're struggling now with the question of postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| and I hope at least you understand that it doesn't bear on the merits of what you're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=546)|
| 0:09:12| It sounds like an exciting proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| but we have neighborhood groups and communities that will be affected by any development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| And what's being urged is that you take the time between now and a postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| if this council decides to do that, to arrange a meeting with the local resident neighborhood groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=563)|
| 0:09:29| because they're impacted by whatever you do there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| and they want to have some role in understanding and perhaps steering your decision-making process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=572)|
| 0:09:38| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| So that's what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| I don't think that's unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| I don't think that's unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| Make sure the owner gets that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| But also try to understand that time is of the essence when you're applying for these tax credits as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=588)|
| 0:09:54| But I understand the global picture is bigger than the minutia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=594)|
| 0:10:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| And one of these questions is probably back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| In terms of who you were contacted by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| we need to probably give some direction on who the appropriate folks from Park Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=607)|
| 0:10:14| Forth and Gill, the surrounding neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| And I also wanted to ask one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| What is your deadline on the financing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| Could you explain the circumstances a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| Well, unfortunately, I don't know all the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| But I just know that the application has to be submitted by the 1st of March, 2011, is what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=629)|
| 0:10:37| Well, in this economy, that sure would be something that would, I think, be welcomed by the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=637)|
| 0:10:44| although I think what you're hearing is we would really encourage you to meet with the neighborhood leaders and discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=644)|
| 0:10:52| And also, I think, you know, the administration and the council members are eager to find out more about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| and the pros and the cons and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| But, Mayor, if you could recommend some individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| Well, we have really two more persons signed up to speak on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| And one of them, I think, is representing a neighborhood organization who's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=668)|
| 0:11:14| So I think I'll go ahead and recognize her now, Cynthia Stansel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=674)|
| 0:11:22| If you would come down and give your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| Cynthia Stansel, 2003 Washington Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| We are very excited that this project is possibly moving forward, and we hope to encourage the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=690)|
| 0:11:37| But we have not had a chance at this point to speak with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| or any of his representatives other than a brief phone call yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| It is my understanding from a phone call that I had from him just before the meeting tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| that we would be able to meet and speak with him sometime next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| So we would ask that we postpone this until we've had a chance to speak with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=715)|
| 0:12:01| But we just appreciate the consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| Ms. Stansel, would a two-week postponement, you think that would be appropriate for your neighborhood organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=724)|
| 0:12:12| or enough time for your organization to meet with a developer, or would that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| We would hope so, considering that all of a sudden this financing request has to be in by the first of March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=737)|
| 0:12:24| and this is the first that we are hearing about this, that is concerning at the very least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=744)|
| 0:12:29| So we would hope that he would be able to move within that two-week period to speak with us and to convey what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=749)|
| 0:12:37| Two weeks might help the developer and the neighborhood organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| We also have, were you finished with your comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| I'm finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| We also have, I believe that's Dwight Gunn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=766)|
| 0:12:53| I think I'm pronouncing your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| You can give your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| It's Dwight Gunn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| I live at 1249 Monroe Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| I've owned and lived there since 1979.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| That property is within a block and a half of the standard knitting mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=788)|
| 0:13:15| I'd like to start out and say I support the redevelopment of the standard knitting mill property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=795)|
| 0:13:22| I support a rezoning of the standard knitting mill property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| I feel like that the C2 zone is completely inappropriate for that redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=807)|
| 0:13:38| The C2 zone has no requirements for parking at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=818)|
| 0:13:44| Effectively, if this property is zoned C2, the developer has no requirement to provide on-site parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=824)|
| 0:13:54| C2 would require no guarantee that the existing buildings would have to remain on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=834)|
| 0:14:05| Once the rezoning is done, the property, the existing buildings could be demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=845)|
| 0:14:11| No overlay protection currently exists on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| Also, C2 has no provisions for additional review by MPC or the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=855)|
| 0:14:26| A plan zoned CP1, which does allow for mixed use of commercial and residential, would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=866)|
| 0:14:38| It would require a plan submittal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| It would require approval of that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| Everyone, city, neighborhoods, would understand what the redevelopment plan was and how it would proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=885)|
| 0:14:54| I just think a plan zone would be much more appropriate than a C2 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=894)|
| 0:15:02| And I would support the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=905)|
| 0:15:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| May I ask Mr. Donaldson a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| Mr. Donaldson, was PC1 considered for this particular area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=917)|
| 0:15:23| It wasn't requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| Is it appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| PC1 allows for dwelling units on the second floor and above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=926)|
| 0:15:33| So if that was the ultimate plan that would be compatible with what they propose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=933)|
| 0:15:41| we were not made aware of any of the details of the proposed development up to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=941)|
| 0:15:48| Most of this is new information to us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=948)|
| 0:15:55| The C2 generally is our urban mixed-use zone district, and we have been using it in areas surrounding downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=955)|
| 0:16:04| We were told about the commitment to park within the building, so we felt comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=964)|
| 0:16:11| But PC1, if their plan is to put all of the residential up above the first floor, could work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=971)|
| 0:16:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| Councilman De La Vope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| As long as we've got Mr. Donaldson speaking to this, if we were to go with C2 whenever this comes before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=981)|
| 0:16:30| that meets the general plan as modified by the Magnolia Corridor Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| Do we have a sector plan or a one-year plan issue here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| No, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| Both the one-year plan and the sector plan, which has been modified by the Magnolia Corridor Plan, show this area as mixed-use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1000)|
| 0:16:49| So that falls within it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| So there is no other hurdle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| My other question, Mr. Mayor, is it appears from what Cindy just told me that we may only have one more meeting in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| and I don't know what the magic date is in March, but we'll have to have a second meeting in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| and that's going to be a logistical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| Well, I was going to change my motion probably to two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| and I think that might help the situation for the developer and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1033)|
| 0:17:19| There's only one meeting in February left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| We can do it on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| He said you can do it on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| Well, let me go back to Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| Oh, you had your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| And then have the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| While we're thinking about the two readings and the timing and the calendar, let me ask Mr. Donaldson, my apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| Councilman Grieve may have asked this, and I didn't understand it clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| I know if the item hasn't been considered by MPC, we have to go backwards to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| but if an alternate zoning such as what Mr. Gwynne suggested becomes appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1078)|
| 0:18:04| that was considered at MPC and we don't have to roll backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| Is that correct, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1087)|
| 0:18:12| That would be we certainly considered mixed-use zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| I don't know that we actually had a discussion about PC1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1098)|
| 0:18:24| And another thing the applicant would have to be made aware of is that the PC is a two-step zoning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| whereupon your rights aren't guaranteed until the development plan is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| and that may impact their tax credit application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| So we'll have to bring everybody up to speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| One factor in making the judgment as to whether something has to go back to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1127)|
| 0:18:54| is whether that new information would in fact change the Planning Commission's mind or their consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1134)|
| 0:19:02| In this case, I don't think that it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| Both of those districts are compatible with the request and with the land-use plan that's in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1145)|
| 0:19:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| I mean, I think what I hear this Council saying is we're excited about some possibilities at this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| It's been on Knox Heritage Fragile 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| It's an area where we would like to see good development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| but we also want good public process and the opportunity for neighborhoods to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| And we've got a deadline that we're trying to work with the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| and so we're just trying to get our arms around how do we do all of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| and not get tripped up at the last minute with MPC deadlines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| or our own meeting calendar deadline schedule and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| I think what I'm going to do is pull a Bob Becker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| and say that there's something that doesn't feel quite right about this from the standpoint that a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1194)|
| 0:20:01| or an individual has had a piece of property for over two or three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| and we have a neighborhood that is highly interested in what goes on in their surrounding areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1204)|
| 0:20:10| and this is a fragile neighborhood that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| And I do believe that all the other projects that I have been familiar with in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| we've always had neighborhood input with the developers that have worked in that particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| And even though I understand and can appreciate the time deadline, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| I feel like a Bob Becker that there's something going on here that we're being put in a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| where we're asked to immediately do something that we need to consider the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| And, again, I'm not against development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| I'm excited about the possibility of something happening in this particular property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| but it's been there for three years or longer, depending on how long the individual has had it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| and yet we find out here at the last minute that the neighborhood wasn't talked to about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| And so I have a real concern about that, and I think we need to take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| Well, I had my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| I was just thinking, you know, because of the time deadline that they're under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1266)|
| 0:21:13| just as a suggestion to go ahead and hear it and, you know, make whatever, take whatever action on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1273)|
| 0:21:22| and then we deal with it probably in a lot more detail at the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| That way we don't, I know it's not been the council, it's not been real happy about doing emergency readings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| but this is probably one that, you know, that I would certainly consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| But I'm just throwing that out as an option of a way to us to behave this evening on this particular situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1297)|
| 0:21:45| That might help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| Yeah, Councilman Pavlis, I would support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| Certainly in my time on council there's been situations where we've heard something on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| with the assumption that there was still some dialogue that needed to happen, and that happened between times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| And if we get to second reading and we're still unhappy with where we are, we can postpone second reading, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| But it does kind of get us off the starting block with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| Councilman Della Vope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| My only concern with that is I don't know how many of the neighborhood groups are here represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| and prepared to speak or have seen a plan that shows anything more than what we just heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1337)|
| 0:22:23| the 120 residential units within a certain affordable housing type tax credit range and the commercial thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1343)|
| 0:22:31| So the debate is going to be a little bit lopsided in the sense of the amount of information we're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1351)|
| 0:22:37| But I understand that we have a second chance to do that when second reading comes, whenever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1357)|
| 0:22:44| But I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| Is there anyone here from Forth and Gill or from Old North Knox that's also raised questions about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1365)|
| 0:22:51| Old Knox Heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| Or Knoxville Heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| You are from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| Why don't you come down to the microphone, please, and give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| Hello, my name is Tracy Helwinkel, 1625 Jefferson Avenue, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| And I live a block from the proposed facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| And I heard of this plan today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| I've lived in this neighborhood for over six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| Six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| The people that own the property bought it in June of 2007, and this is the first we are hearing of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1398)|
| 0:23:24| I can guarantee you have not heard from any other neighborhoods because they don't know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| I know for a fact that if you go through a first reading tonight, it's going to make it harder for us in a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1410)|
| 0:23:36| We have already expressed our excitement that this standard knitting mill would be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| However, we are very concerned to what this means, development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| And if you were to pass this tonight and you did not know about this yourselves up to last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1425)|
| 0:23:51| I would find it very irresponsible of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| Chair will recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| Come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| I just wanted to go on the record by saying that I'm sorry that people didn't know about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| but on January 13th of 2010, zoning was recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1448)|
| 0:24:14| The applicant requested rezoning, and MPC unanimously voted that C2 was the correct zoning for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1454)|
| 0:24:29| I'm pretty sure that MPC is public meeting, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| Did you say 2010 or 2011?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| Last month it was a public meeting, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| MPC is public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| And the agenda is published, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| Yes, but that's only, are you saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| A few weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| That's right, January 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| That's not much time for people to study it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| Well, let me also say, too, that there's nothing really to study at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| The owner is just now realizing the available funds and trying to take advantage of what's available in this economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1503)|
| 0:25:12| and I can speak for him professionally to say that there are no plans yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| I think my motion is still on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| Call the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| What is the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| Let's restate the motion, if you would, Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| The motion is to postpone 12C for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1531)|
| 0:25:39| Well, I had thought about changing it, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| but it appears that the neighborhood organizations really want to get a little more time with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1542)|
| 0:25:49| Of course, Councilman Pavlis, did you make yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| No, it was just a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| I'm going to leave it at four, and if we want to change it, someone can change it to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| I think I seconded it, didn't I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| I believe you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| I'll leave it at four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| Yes, I'd be willing to move it to two weeks with the understanding that if we had to, we could obviously postpone it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| but I want to encourage these people to get together and talk and see if we have something to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| I don't want to just foreclose their application because of the process we're engaged in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1578)|
| 0:26:25| I think if we give them a short deadline, they'll have to start talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| If they need more time, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| It seems like we almost have a fait accompli if we postpone it into March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| We've sort of killed the goose before it had a chance to lay the egg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| So I'd like to see them get together next week or the week after before our meeting and talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1600)|
| 0:26:47| and then report back to us where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| Well, with your ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| I would move to amend your motion from four weeks to two weeks, but to still postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| Substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| Does that need a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| Well, Mayor, I was just going to say I think that I talked to the administration today about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| and they hadn't heard about it and we haven't heard about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| and the surrounding neighborhoods hasn't heard about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| I think there's a little misunderstanding on what needs to happen in terms of communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| And I don't think the ownership is in any way trying to pull an end around or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| I think we just need to meet and discuss and for the details to come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| because I think we all want the best and the highest use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| And so either way we go, whether it's with Councilman Pablos and do it on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| which clearly when it comes back on second reading, if we haven't accomplished our goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| we wouldn't vote again on the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| Or if you don't think you don't know the details on the financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| we can just go ahead and postpone it for a couple of weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| and make sure that we've adequately met and discussed and gone through this thoroughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| and then bring it back in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| I feel certain that the owner will be delighted to meet with all the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| Well, you know, along those same lines, I mean, I think I agree with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| that all of us are excited about any kind of development that can occur there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| But I'm a little concerned that when they say they don't even have plans on what they're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| I mean, to verbally tell a neighborhood we're going to have parking on the first level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| and so many units up above and maybe commercial or this sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| I get a little concerned about that because there's nothing documented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| And it's going to take more than two weeks, I would think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| in order to have some kind of documentation, some type of presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| that's going to be presented to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| so that the neighborhood can visually see what it is they're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| So I don't think the four weeks is out of line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| We can produce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| We're going to let you be seated now, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| Councilman Talavopi made a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| Councilman Roddy, let me recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| I'd like to recognize Mr. Gwinn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| Mr. Gwinn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| Thank you, Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| I'd like to address the four-week versus two-week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| in light of the fact that the size of this development, its impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1767)|
| 0:29:36| the difference in the potential of going through with a C2 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| compared to a planned zone is of the utmost importance in this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1782)|
| 0:29:52| I'm not exactly sure how the C2 was not questioned at MPC staff level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1792)|
| 0:30:03| but I really feel like the size of this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| it's a quarter or more of all of downtown in terms of area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| I can't believe that we're going to expect the neighborhoods, the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1812)|
| 0:30:19| the city administration to give this project a go-ahead in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| I think it needs more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| I think the zoning question itself needs to be kicked back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1827)|
| 0:30:34| and look about a planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| Let me ask you, are you a member of a neighborhood organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| or representing yourself as an individual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| At this time, I have been a member of Park Ridge Community Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| I'm not currently a paying dues member of that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| So in this case, I'm representing myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| but I think I'm also speaking for many people in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| I'm sure Ms. Stansel could comment further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| Councilman Rotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| I have a great deal of respect for everybody that's involved in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| and certainly for those folks who represent the neighborhoods who want to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| I guess I'm going to support the two-week postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| just because I feel like it brings accountability to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| It puts a shorter time frame on folks getting together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| and if we hear from folks in two weeks that what needs to be accomplished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| hasn't been accomplished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| I understand the complexities of perhaps going back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| if we end up ultimately considering another zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| But as my colleague, Councilman De La Volpe, said, we can postpone again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| We can cross that bridge and we can come to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| but two weeks gives us tighter accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| So I do respect everyone that wants this process to go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| but I'm going to support two weeks just to keep this moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| and we can postpone again for longer if we need to at that juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| Councilman De La Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| I wonder, Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| if you have facilities or capability to host a meeting at your place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| so that we could get notices out and whatnot through the council office or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| Is there some advantage to that, or would you rather not be in the middle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1930)|
| 0:32:16| We could check on the availability of the small assembly room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| but I don't know if it would be available right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| And we encounter issues about parking and all of that sort of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1942)|
| 0:32:29| where a meeting off-site quite often is more neighborhood friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| I think the substitute motion is on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| To be clear, would you restate it, Ms. Mitchell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| The substitute motion is to postpone 12C for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| You're opposing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| Well, I'm voting aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| Two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| Two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| Well, I think the ayes have it, and so are it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| Any items requested to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| Consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| Under Mayor's report, the first thing I want to do is to recognize Boy Scout Troop Number Six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2011)|
| 0:33:38| from Second Presbyterian Church, if they would stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2018)|
| 0:33:44| Let's give them a round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2024)|
| 0:33:52| Is your Scoutmaster here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| Oh, there he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| Well, thank you so much for coming, and I understand you have to return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| but we appreciate you coming tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| Did you want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| You can come down to the mic if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2047)|
| 0:34:17| You'll have to forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| I've got kind of a stuffy nose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| Give us your name and your address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| My name is Mark Hipshire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| I live at 5451 Lance Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| I'm a life scout for the Boy Scouts of America, Troop Number Six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2067)|
| 0:34:33| We are Knoxville's oldest troop, chartered January 29, 1915,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2073)|
| 0:34:40| when the Bob White Patrol, composed of six boys and an assistant scoutmaster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| was organized, meeting at Fort Sanders Presbyterian Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| which was later we were to move to Second Presbyterian Church in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| We have just completed our 95th year as a troop together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| and as usual, we have an aggressive agenda in our 96th year full of outings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| Over the years, we have had 18 volunteer scoutmasters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| and innumerable assistant scoutmasters to set up the troop from Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| and lead the troop, and we've honored over, to date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| 180 Eagle Scouts in the local Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| One of our special adult volunteers that we would like to publicly recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| and thank for his service to Troop Six is Mr. Duane Greve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| who is our volunteer Eagle Scout coordinator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| and he meets with our scouts to plan and approve their Eagle Scout projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| as they achieve their Eagle rank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| Tonight, the majority of our members are here attending the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| in order to fulfill some requirements for the Communications and Citizenship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2147)|
| 0:35:53| and Nation Merit Badge, and we would like to thank you for recognizing us tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| and look forward to learning more about how our local government works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| Thank you very much, and thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| Let's give another hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2164)|
| 0:36:13| Under the mayor's report, I have a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| I know all of you will join me in expressing our appreciation to Chief Owen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| for his years of service to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| He has not gone yet, but he soon will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| He has been a great leader for the police department and the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| and we will miss him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| I will be announcing his replacement soon, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| We'll have more to say about Chief Owen, but we want to just recognize him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2200)|
| 0:37:02| I think he'll be with us a little while longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| This is not his last night, but we just wanted to say something about it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| Also, the city of Knoxville is currently accepting applications from nonprofit organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2228)|
| 0:37:15| interested in obtaining the city community agency grant for the fiscal year 2011-2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2235)|
| 0:37:22| which begins on July 1, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| The deadline for filing an application is 5 p.m. Friday, February 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2246)|
| 0:37:33| and the city will not consider any application received after that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| To apply for a grant, an organization must operate within the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| and it must have been in operation for at least five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| There are two different application forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| One is for organizations seeking a grant within the arts and culture category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2270)|
| 0:37:57| and the second is for other nonprofit agencies seeking a city grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2277)|
| 0:38:02| Priority in awarding the grants will be given to proposals that contribute to the goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2282)|
| 0:38:08| and mission of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| Also, you can get applications online at the city website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2291)|
| 0:38:19| Any reports from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2304)|

| 0:38:49| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| Thank you, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| I just wanted to report that we had a meeting of the South Knox Business Association a week ago last Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2332)|
| 0:39:00| the first meeting as such since the actual closure of the Henley Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| And it was a good meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| It was well attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| Many folks from the business community came out and expressed, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| some of their concerns that we anticipated that there would be concerns, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| at the first closure of the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| I spoke with TDOT today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| One of the main issues that I think that can be addressed was signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| Out on the actual connector itself and then leading into the Chapman Highway Business District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2368)|
| 0:39:34| So TDOT today spoke with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| and they agreed that they would put some additional signage on the James White Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2376)|
| 0:39:42| identifying the Chapman Highway Business Corridor and moving people that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| And then hopefully I'll be able to work with Mr. King| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| and some folks to get some additional signage there at Moody and Chapman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| and even directing people to the business district there in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2395)|
| 0:40:02| So I just want to urge people to know that South Knoxville is open for business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| and urge them also to go to our website, southknoxisopen.com,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| and just continue to patronize the businesses that you have in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| The traffic flow is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| There's not been any backups, nothing major like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| So it's very easy to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| But please keep continuing to patronize the folks in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| because we certainly need it during these hard economic times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2431)|

| 0:40:44| Also David Brace and David Massey and the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| And wanted to report that we were especially pleased that a number of issues that came up in the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2448)|
| 0:40:56| were handled by David the following Monday and Tuesday, and also with the codes people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2456)|
| 0:41:01| So we appreciate the quick action of the administration taking care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| But thank you again, Mayor, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2465)|

| 0:42:42| Councilman Roddy, did you want to recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| Yes, Mr. Mayor, if I could, may I recognize Patrick Riggins, Chairman of the Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| and the sisters, Helen and Ellen, if they would like to come to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| and say a few words about their ministry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| As they approach the podium, I'll just say that their work has made a substantial impact on our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| I think one of the things that many people may not realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| is that over 80% of the 2,000 meals that are prepared every week at the Love Kitchen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| are delivered to the homebound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| And so there are a lot of folks who depend on the outreach and the ministry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| not only of these two fine ladies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| but the many, many volunteers that get those meals out every single week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2600)|

| 0:44:17| to celebrate your silver anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| Do you want to say anything about your celebration on Sunday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| Patrick is a chef cook, so Patrick, do you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2664)|
| 0:44:29| Yeah, I'm sure everyone's gotten a card by now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2669)|

| 0:44:39| from 12 o'clock to about 3 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2679)|

| 0:44:46| and congratulate them on 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| It will be very informal, so if you want to come by, great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| and you can come and go as you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| And Sunday is the actual 25th anniversary of the ministry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| and how appropriate the day before Valentine's Day that the name of the ministry is the Love Kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2697)|
| 0:45:03| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2703)|

| 0:45:13| Well, Patrick, why don't you tell them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| I might tell too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2717)|

| 0:45:34| but they can answer any questions about the show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| And then they're also going to be featured on a show called Secret Millionaire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| I'm sure you've seen the promotions already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2742)|

| 0:46:08| and I'm looking forward to watching you on Oprah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| And wherever I am, if I'm in a meeting, I'm going to have to stop it so I can watch you on Oprah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| And thank you for coming very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| Let's give them a round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2779)|
| 0:46:28| I think we did not vote on the motion, so the motion is still on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=2788)|

| 0:53:06| I am here this evening as a proud and concerned resident of the Old North Knox Historic District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3186)|
| 0:53:13| I'm here this evening because I have concerns about habitual offenders in regards to prostitution in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3193)|
| 0:53:22| These prostitutes have become a fixture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| These couple of blocks that run along the Central Avenue corridor have become almost a destination for neighboring neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3206)|
| 0:53:36| and neighboring counties soliciting such activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3216)|
| 0:53:41| I commend local law enforcement for the recent sting that brought in a number of these ladies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3221)|
| 0:53:49| but yet to find them out on the street within 48 hours back in the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3229)|

| 0:54:13| As I know that Central Avenue is an empowerment zone that the city is looking to in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3253)|
| 0:54:19| to allocate funds to make this a pedestrian mixed-use corridor that connects downtown to this Old North Knox district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3259)|

| 0:54:42| I saw on the front page of the newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| but yet to see them again within 48 hours right back to where they were picked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| So I would petition the city to formulate some sort of proposal or enact some sort of plan to remedy this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3290)|
| 0:54:57| if we ever hope that this neighborhood might become a viable district once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3297)|
| 0:55:04| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| That's duly noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| That is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| Chief, did you have any comments to make at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3308)|
| 0:55:14| Well, I guess we have spoken of this problem, and this young lady is speaking of a specific area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| but we have other areas of the city where we experience the same problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| It is a situation where when someone is arrested by our laws, they're allowed to bond out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3323)|
| 0:55:30| Unfortunately, they're not getting jail time, and as a result, it creates a problem for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3330)|
| 0:55:37| We're doing our very best to address it from a law enforcement standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| but it's a much bigger problem than just arresting these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| Well, thank you for coming, and we will be certainly looking into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3343)|
| 0:55:49| See any more lights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| Nothing else to come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| If I just had one more question, if I can hope to hear of plans in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| or ways in which these women are being held longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| who do I go to over as months and months carry on to see any action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| and hope for any sort of proposal that might get these women off the streets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| I don't know if it means some sort of program that's enacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| I'm just curious of who I turn to in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| Let me recognize Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| Yeah, one of the things I was going to ask, and thank you, Mr. Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| and maybe you know this, Council, is this another one of those municipal fines where $50 is the maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3381)|
| 0:56:30| our judge can grant so that it's hard to discourage someone who treats that as the cost of doing business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3390)|
| 0:56:35| if that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| Every municipal fine is limited to $50 under the Constitution of the State of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| There was a movement two years ago to amend the Constitution to raise that limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3402)|
| 0:56:47| and the voters of the State of Tennessee declined to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3407)|
| 0:56:52| Do we have any state statutes, do you know, Chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| that you can tack on to account that makes it more difficult to avoid the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3414)|
| 0:57:02| Mr. DellaVolpe, this is not a new problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| No, it's a perennial problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| And we have dealt with, there's not a program you're going to create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| It involves changing of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| And if you want to pursue something, I would suggest you pursue it through your elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3436)|
| 0:57:21| not these elected officials, your state officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| But I know that General Nichols from the District Attorney General's Office recognizes this is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3444)|
| 0:57:31| The judiciary recognizes it's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| The neighbors certainly recognize it's a problem, but it's not a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| It's passed in here and it all goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| It is a matter of changing the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| And so I would encourage you to, asking what you can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| I would encourage you to communicate with your state representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| and your state senators and request their attention to this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| And I will suggest to the young lady that I'll be happy if you want to meet with General Nichols| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| or someone to talk about what options he sees because he obviously sees a prosecutorial end of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3477)|
| 0:58:03| that maybe that would be a good place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| If you'll contact me, I will be happy to set up a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3485)|
| 0:58:10| and we'll try to talk to them about that and see where that takes us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| I certainly appreciate that proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3500)|
| 0:58:21| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3501)|
| 0:58:22| We have had the same similar problem at Emory Place over the past 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| And one of the best things that we've done, I guess I ought to find out whether or not this is legal or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| but we've taken license plates for the Johns who are coming by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3512)|
| 0:58:39| And it's interesting when you call their home to let them know that they were down in your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| And so we found that that has begun to work pretty well in terms of maybe they're all leaving Emory Place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3524)|
| 0:58:51| and going to your street, I don't know, but they're certainly not around as much as they used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| So just by taking the license plates and trying to find out who's who has helped quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3535)|
| 0:59:01| Councilman Grieve, I think it was in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| The Nashville Tennessean started publishing not only the names of prostitutes that were arrested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3545)|
| 0:59:14| but their customers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| And, of course, it's an age-old problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| I think we should tell their mamas is what I think we should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| That would straighten it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3562)|
| 0:59:23| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3563)|
| 0:59:24| And there's no further business before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110208?start=3568)|
