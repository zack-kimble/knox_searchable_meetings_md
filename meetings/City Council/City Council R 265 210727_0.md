| 0:02:17| motion to postpone items 10 A and 12 C. Those deal with the North Shore Town Center. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=137)|
| 0:02:25| parties have actually scheduled a meeting to review some renderings for next week, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=145)|

| 0:02:58| interested are out of town, that we hear this on August 10th as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=178)|

| 0:03:20| Okay, seeing none, are there any items requested to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=200)|

| 0:03:50| It's nice to see you. I wanted to start my mayor's report tonight by addressing the recent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=230)|
| 0:03:56| uptick in COVID case numbers in our city and across the country. As you all may already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| know, the Knox County Board of Health has called a special meeting for tomorrow evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=240)|
| 0:04:06| and I just want to say, again, we appreciate all of their guidance that they've provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| throughout the pandemic, and I look forward to hearing their conversation tomorrow night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| A year ago, in July 2020, we were preaching everybody in the community to follow the five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| core actions. That's all we had at the time, to wash your hands, wear a face mask, stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=260)|
| 0:04:27| home when sick. What were the other ones? Sanitize surfaces and physical distancing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=267)|
| 0:04:33| and you know, people did that, and thank you for everyone who did that. Now, a year later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=273)|
| 0:04:39| we have had a vaccine available to us for the last six months, and so I'm really grateful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=279)|
| 0:04:46| for that, as I know many people are, and I just want to continue to encourage members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| of our community to avail themselves of the vaccine. That is the way we get out of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| pandemic. Get vaccinated for yourself, for your family, and for our community. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=295)|
| 0:05:03| moving right along, we have been able to do many things safely despite COVID, and some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=303)|
| 0:05:11| of the, one of my favorite things that we've been able to do is, we've had events, concerts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| and festivals, and one of the biggest successes has been Kid-a-rific. We have our last free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=315)|
| 0:05:21| Kid-a-rific event tomorrow, World's Fair Park, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. This final celebration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=321)|
| 0:05:27| will include a magician, a water balloon area, free ice cream, the downtown market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| is giving away samples, organizers from Ola Festival will have a craft, and the ice bears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| will be there, and so much more. So, big thanks to the special events team and all of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| partners for organizing this wonderful weekly event. I've been able to come to attend a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| couple of them, and they're really fun, and the whole family has a good time. So, tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| we're going to pause, as part of my mayor's report, to recognize the incredible work of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| the Knoxville-Knox County Food Policy Council. At the onset of the pandemic, the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=357)|
| 0:06:03| came together through the United Way to form a coordinated social services response. A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| food access committee was formed as part of this effort, and the Food Policy Council led| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| that effort. In the end, more than 75 individuals representing both traditional and non-traditional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=372)|
| 0:06:18| food access and emergency food service organizations were represented. This year's Food Policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| Report highlights those efforts, the people served, and much more. Kimberly Pettigrew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=383)|
| 0:06:28| the chair of the Food Policy Council, is here tonight to share a few highlights from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| Food Policy Report with council. Kimberly, if you could come to the podium to state your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| name and address for the record, and share with us all the good work that you all have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| been doing. We really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| Thank you all for having me. Kimberly Pettigrew, 516 West Vine Avenue. So, as Mayor Kincannon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=403)|
| 0:06:50| mentioned, I currently serve as the chair of the Knoxville-Knox County Food Policy Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| and chaired the EOS Food Access Social Service Group in 2020 in partnership with Fiona McAnally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=415)|
| 0:07:01| of the City of Knoxville. For those of you who are new to the work of Food Policy Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=421)|
| 0:07:07| we are an advisory board. We are made of members that are appointed by the city mayor, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| county mayor, and then we have associate members that represent other systems of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| food sector. Our goal is to develop and assess public policy strategies, make recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=436)|
| 0:07:23| that promote a healthy, fair, and sustainable food system, and we also get to brag that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| we're the nation's oldest food policy council. So, there's now hundreds across the nation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| but we were the first. As Mayor Kincannon mentioned, today you have two reports in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=452)|
| 0:07:38| of you. One that focuses on our food system's response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=458)|
| 0:07:44| and a state of the food system report. This is one that we highlight more generalized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| data around growing and eating. We did our first report in 2019, and then we did an update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=468)|
| 0:07:53| to that in 2020, and we'll be creating a brand new report in 2021 that dives deeper into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| some issues that I'm about to address. So, overall in 2020, we were able to meet the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| food needs of our community by creating a model of success. We focused on open and effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| communication, supporting innovation within current networks, and bringing voices to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| table from grassroots organizations and those that serve at-risk clients. 2020 also brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| to light that the data we've traditionally used to track food access and food security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| including Second Harvest and Feeding America data, does not present a true picture of what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| actually happening on the ground level. In the report, you'll see that we actually, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| data showed that we had a decline in food needs in 2020. So, we all know that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| true. So, what we realized is that people need food more than ever, but they're tending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=518)|
| 0:08:44| to use more community-level organizations for their food needs. So, our two groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=524)|
| 0:08:50| both Food Access and Food Policy, have really been taking a deeper dive into how our community's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| use of emergency food services have shifted to smaller organizations that meet specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| needs and how to continue to communicate effectively. So, both the Food Access and Food Policy group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=539)|
| 0:09:08| will continue. We're going to continue to meet and refine the nuances of food access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| security, and policy to create a sustainable, equitable, and accessible food system. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| excited to announce I've accepted the role at the United Way of Greater Knoxville. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| going to be the Director of Food Security Systems, and my job is really to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| this work. I'm going to focus on strategic planning in partnership with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| nonprofits, businesses, and government leadership to create countywide vision of building a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| more just and equitable food system while providing mentorship and support for up-and-coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=575)|
| 0:09:40| food system leaders and organizations. So, this is where we are, and I look forward to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| continue to update you all on where we're going. I have a couple reports here. If anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=584)|
| 0:09:50| needs a copy, there was one sent digitally, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| Councilmembers, does everybody get their copy? Is there a question? Ms. Parker, do you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=594)|
| 0:10:00| a question for Ms. Pettigrew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| I have a question. Thank you so much for providing the report. I, again, think this is a report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=601)|
| 0:10:09| that when we review it as City Council, it would be great if it's a part of our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=609)|
| 0:10:16| you know, if we can attach it to the Mayor's report, the same reports attached in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| area before the public can have access to it, we can read it beforehand. But I did have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=620)|
| 0:10:27| time to quickly read through the report before the meeting, and I'm glad that you acknowledged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=627)|
| 0:10:33| that a lot of the community is relying on community groups, and that's one thing I saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=633)|
| 0:10:40| missing from the report was a reflection of a lot of the work that so many of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=640)|
| 0:10:45| groups have done. There's one organization I talked to right before I came into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=645)|
| 0:10:51| meeting who delivered 32,000 meals to Knox County residents and wasn't included in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=651)|
| 0:10:59| report. Another one who delivered 13,000 meals and wasn't included in this report. So there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| a lot of support happening on that grassroots level that we're not able to capture, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=664)|
| 0:11:10| we're having systems in place that are telling us that there's a smaller need. We've also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=670)|
| 0:11:16| seen that in our CHAMP system, right? And so I'm wondering, as you move forward in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=676)|
| 0:11:26| work, what steps do you plan to take, perhaps even in your new role, or what steps have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=686)|
| 0:11:33| been discussed to try to have a report that better reflects the work that's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=693)|
| 0:11:39| To be truthful, the fact that we have a report is pretty impressive without a staff person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=699)|
| 0:11:44| to date, and so I'm really looking forward to being able to create a general understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| of what's happening without having someone who's focused on food access and food policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| Like you mentioned, there are groups that are doing amazing work that people don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| about it, and so I think a lot of what my job will do will be to figure out what groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| are doing and to have a better knowledge base of how we can connect those groups. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| hope to have a much more robust report moving forward. I think that's part of the longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=727)|
| 0:12:13| term strategic planning that will come into place. But you're right, having staff people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| is what really helps that. So I'm proud that we got one done, and I'm excited that we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=737)|
| 0:12:23| to grow that and be more inclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| Yeah. Well, thank you for lifting up that need in the community. I see a great need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=745)|
| 0:12:32| in our city for more paid staff dedicated to helping with coordinating these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=752)|
| 0:12:38| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| Thank you. Ms. Parker, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| Yes. Thank you very much for the work you've done so far, and I enjoyed reading your report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=764)|
| 0:12:51| What connections will be made, if any, or where do you see community gardens or individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| growing food in their own home gardens? Where will that fit in the entire picture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=777)|
| 0:13:04| Well, as you've touched on, food encompasses so many things, from when we're growing food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=784)|
| 0:13:11| to consuming food to processing food, and that's a big project to take on. So what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=791)|
| 0:13:17| think I'll mostly be doing is doing a lot of listening and learning. We have great groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| that are already plugged into community gardens, including Beardsley Farm and the Master Growers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| Program. They're really working on community engagement, but in order to do that, we really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| need to listen to the community and identify what they want. So until I can do that, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| don't really want to say specifically what we'll be doing, other than we will be listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| and learning in order to move forward in the most sustainable, equitable way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| Yeah, that's great. I'm glad that you're considering, you know, all possible options there. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=824)|
| 0:13:51| there is, like, a growing body of people who are actually growing food as a serious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=831)|
| 0:13:58| way of supplementing their tables. You know, gardening used to be a bit of a hobby. Everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| liked to get the garden vegetables, but it was also, you know, mainly a hobby. But now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| there's people that are actually looking for it to be a sustainable food source. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| the more that we can do that in an urban area, you know, that would be one part of the puzzle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=854)|
| 0:14:21| So thank you. Yes. Thank you, Council Member Thomas. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| you, Ms. Pettigrew. Really appreciate your work on this. Council, one other thing I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| to, that ties into my report on COVID and the Food Policy Council, I want to take a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=871)|
| 0:14:38| moment to recognize a local food program that recently received a national honor. The Senior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| Citizens Home Assistance Program, or SHAS, was recognized for a program they put in motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| during the height of the pandemic. The program was called SHAS Out Shopping, or SOS. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=888)|
| 0:14:53| allows SHAS employees to do the shopping for area seniors, keeping some of our most vulnerable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| residents safe at home. So the city was happy to support this program, along with the good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| work of Tim Howell and many others. So I believe Mr. Howell is here tonight. Oh, there you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| are. If you would like to say a couple words to Council, we're really proud and grateful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=908)|
| 0:15:14| for your work. If you could start by stating your name and address. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| My name is Tim Howell and I'm the CEO of Senior Citizens Home Assistance Service. My address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| is 6853 Fraker Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918. And before I forget, I do want to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=923)|
| 0:15:30| Mayor Kincannon and all the council members for your support of all the nonprofits that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=930)|
| 0:15:36| you help, and especially ours that is out there serving older adults during this pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| and trying to keep them safe. And one of the things that we enacted was a shopping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| program for older adults. If you all remember, the president closed down our nation on March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| the 13th. I think it was a Friday when he gave his message, a Friday the 13th. On March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| the 19th, which was a Thursday, our agency had decided that we would enact a shopping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| program to allow older adults to remain safely in their homes, to quarantine and not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| to go out and to purchase groceries in grocery stores and get out in the public. And so March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=966)|
| 0:16:13| 19th, we started taking our first orders. In between that time, just to be honest, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| did a lot of praying. I did a lot of thought things. My main goal was to keep my employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| working because our normal service that we do as a nonprofit is send our caregivers into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| the homes of older adults and help them to stay there by doing homemaker services and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| personal care services. And I was kind of wondering, like anybody else that manages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| a business, what are we going to do during this? And I thought, one thing that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| do, and after seeing Facebook posts of people saying, contact us, contact me, I'll go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1000)|
| 0:16:46| and I'll shop for your older adult or your loved one. And what that said to me as a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| that runs a nonprofit that serves older adults was, there are going to be some people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| will do that and do it really well. And there are going to be some people that find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| someone has dementia and they're going to take their financial information from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1019)|
| 0:17:04| and they're going to steal it and they're going to take their money from them and use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| that. And I thought, I've got 270 employees in 16 counties in East Tennessee that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| go do that, that have been drug tested and background checked, and we can shop for these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| folks. And so I made a phone call to Dr. Joe Johnson. And mine, being naive at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| in time, I thought I need about two months' worth of salaries to help cover this and he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| gave me some names to call and within about five minutes on Monday morning, well, more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1046)|
| 0:17:32| like 30 minutes on Monday morning, I had raised $20,000 from different companies in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| to get this program underway, explaining to them what we wanted to do to allow our older| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| adults to stay home. And on March 19th, March 18th, Don Dare ran a story about it. March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1061)|
| 0:17:47| 19th, we were getting our first orders coming over the internet. We had a website set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| If you check out our website, you'll see where you can go order groceries for your loved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| one if they're 60 or above or if they have a compromised immune system. During that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| time, we have shopped for folks with COVID. We've allowed them to stay at home and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| go out and infect more folks because they needed food. We've also delivered groceries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| to hotels to people that had COVID and they needed to get food at that hotel so they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| remain there safely. We've done this in 16 counties throughout East Tennessee. In March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| of last 2020, I wasn't buying groceries for folks. This year, I'm buying, this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| I'm buying like $25,000 worth of groceries and delivering them throughout East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| to serve folks. And our employees are doing that. And our employees, my employees, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| a lot of proud, I think, CEOs throughout the system. I'm one of those proud CEOs. My employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| never back down. We were texting each other, trying to figure out where toilet paper was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| because of a lot of orders that we had with toilet paper and things like that. It doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| have to be groceries, by the way. It can be any supplies that they might need. It could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| be over-the-counter medications. It could have been pet supplies. We had a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| that needed cleaning supplies, different things like that. It's hard to go through a pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| if you don't have cleaning supplies in your home. And so we have processed, at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| in time, thousands of orders and taken them. We've got somebody on the phone answering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1149)|
| 0:19:16| phone calls each day and taking orders. And then you can also process it over the internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| We've got people that live in other states that will go on our website and place their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| orders for their loved ones so that we can go out and shop for them and deliver those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| groceries to them and their needed supplies. We've gotten a couple of other grants. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| all were one of the first initial folks to help us out with this as well when we started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| telling our story about what we're doing. We've been able to get a grant through ETHRA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| and the Older Americans Act funding that allows us to buy food and supplies for some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| older adults throughout East Tennessee that have no money and cannot pay for that. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| also take Snapcards and we pick those Snapcards up and we take them out to the grocery stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| and they give us their code and we deliver them back. And if I can, I just want to tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1194)|

| 0:20:02| the initial stories. We got a reference, a referral from the Office on Aging. They gave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| us a call and said, we've got somebody coming out of the hospital. They've been there three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1207)|

| 0:28:54| creating the African-American Equity Restoration Task Force. It's great so far. It goes on. And appointing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1734)|
| 0:29:02| its members. So let's hold up one second. Is there any reason we cannot uncouple those two tasks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1742)|
| 0:29:10| I'm sure Mr. Swanson has an answer there. My retort would be that just because something can be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1750)|

| 0:31:17| with a simple majority. Did you feel voiceless? Did you feel powerless? Did you feel hopeless?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1877)|
| 0:31:27| Did you feel angry? An idea from African American spiritual leaders I adore is the concept of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1887)|
| 0:31:34| beloved community in which all people can share in the wealth of the earth. It begs the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1894)|
| 0:31:41| does this first act setting up an equity restoration task force align with that vision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1901)|
| 0:31:48| Do we want the process to set up Knoxville's important public boards to leave Knoxvillians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| feeling voiceless, powerless, hopeless, or angry? I submit that moving forward today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1914)|
| 0:32:01| with this resolution as it is written is not a step towards the beloved community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| We can do better. We must do better. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| Thank you, Mr. Jessel. Next person signed up to speak to this item is David Hayes. Mr. Hayes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| if you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| and you will have up to five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| Hello, my name is David Hayes. I live in 1312 Hawthorne Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1944)|
| 0:32:37| All right, let's get it going. So I support the city finally addressing disparities and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| disenfranchisement in the black community. And any council member who votes against this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| resolution because of its focus in the black community is undoubtedly and unapologetically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| racist. I'm speaking tonight to highlight the three issues that will handicap this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1972)|
| 0:32:59| from bringing equity to the black community. First issue is that this task force empowers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| one of the most prominent architects of modern day urban removal. Bill Lyons is a prime example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| of why black wealth is declining and black poverty is expanding in Knoxville. His model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1990)|
| 0:33:16| of downtown development is currently displacing black families and erasing the working class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| While I support many black and brilliant appointments, like Dr. Nkeshi Amin, like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| Brennan Hardin, Bill Lyons, his appointment to this task force is insulting to advocates of equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2005)|
| 0:33:31| and justice. The second item to highlight is the lack of power of the task force. We need a task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2011)|
| 0:33:38| force with the power to implement its solutions, not just give recommendations that could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| ignored by the administration and council. A commitment by the mayor to approve all programmatic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| and policy recommendations of the task force could actually remedy this issue. The third issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| that needs to be highlighted is the lack of guaranteed local funding for the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| of the task force. With a grand budget of zero dollars, this task force is set up to fail before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| it begins. Without tens of millions of dollars earmarked in Knoxville's city budget, the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| has little reason to trust the effectiveness of the effectiveness of this task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| Vague commitments of grant money that we don't know where it's coming from that we only can hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| comes into the city, that vague commitment is not enough. So again, to vote against this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2056)|
| 0:34:22| resolution because of its emphasis on equity in a black community is undoubtedly racist, yet we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| must address the shortcomings of this resolution. Black Knoxvillians deserve a task force that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| transparent and representative of the community and free of gentrifiers. We deserve a task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| that's powerful enough to implement its solutions, and lastly, we deserve a task force that has tens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| of millions of guaranteed money from Knoxville's local budget. And moreover, if you truly support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| equity, then I hope that each of you will vote in favor of Amelia Parker's resolution to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| a zero tolerance policy for racism and sexism. Thank you all. That concludes public forum on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2094)|
| 0:35:01| this agenda item. Council members, I just wanted to first say appreciation for all those who applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2101)|
| 0:35:11| and submitted. Vice Mayor McKenzie and I have had many meetings over the last six to eight months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2111)|
| 0:35:18| having the opportunity to discuss those. So thank you to Vice Mayor McKenzie for all your work on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| this. I'm really pleased with all the interest in this and looking forward to the discussion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2123)|
| 0:35:30| the task force members have about the work ahead. Also just wanted to say thank you to council for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| agreeing to budget a hundred thousand dollars to help facilitate and move forward. Obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2135)|
| 0:35:42| there's a lot more money to be applied for and sought and, you know, decide how to invest that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2142)|
| 0:35:48| but that's a good start and I appreciate everyone's support for that. Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2148)|
| 0:35:54| Thank you, Mayor. I want to thank everyone that signed up to speak. Also, I want to take this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| opportunity to thank all those individuals who did show interest in applying to serve on the task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2159)|
| 0:36:05| force. The task force will be hitting the ground running once they are approved, and then also we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2165)|
| 0:36:11| will be discussing term limits, meeting cadence, and then also looking to develop sub committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2171)|
| 0:36:18| This is not a task force that will be working in isolation, but will be working collectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| across the community and across the city to be able to get this work done. And so I do want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2183)|
| 0:36:31| ask a point of clarification that the 10-year commitment will start today once the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2191)|
| 0:36:38| is approved. That was my understanding. I'd have to look back at the original thing. I mean, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2198)|
| 0:36:46| sounds reasonable to me. Yeah, that sounds fine. Okay, just wanted to be clear on that. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2206)|
| 0:36:55| with that said, I do want to thank those that will be stepping up to serve and then also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2215)|
| 0:37:02| just the broader community that will be working collectively with us moving forward. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| thank you. Thank you. I just wanted to take a minute to recognize if all those who are here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2226)|
| 0:37:12| have been nominated to serve on this task force could either stand or raise your hand. Just wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| to recognize you as people who have been willing to volunteer to do your time and energy and talents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2237)|
| 0:37:24| to do this important work. So, thank you. Appreciate you being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2244)|
| 0:37:33| Okay, Ms. Parker. I was hoping we would be able to discuss how the selection for the members was made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2253)|
| 0:37:42| and what you anticipate each member bringing to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| And we can start with Mr. Lyons. What would his contribution to the committee be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2266)|
| 0:37:54| Well, Mr. Lyons has a long history with the city and as a policy professor and someone who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2274)|
| 0:38:01| familiar with how to get things done in an effective way. And, you know, just this again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2281)|
| 0:38:08| these are nominations and Vice Mayor McKenzie and I had the opportunity to review all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2288)|
| 0:38:14| nominations and there were many talented people and he was one of them and brings a wealth of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2294)|
| 0:38:19| knowledge and experience to this role. Can you be more specific of what type of experience you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2299)|
| 0:38:25| looking for for the committee? Just experience? Vice Mayor McKenzie? Yes. So, from Mr. Lyons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2305)|
| 0:38:32| perspective, it was his background in policy and politics and also being a professor at University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| of Tennessee. So, that was an element that was much needed. Also, with some of the other task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| force members where you'll see that we have an attorney, we have educators, we have people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| have been in the community doing advocacy work as well. And so, I did not realize that we didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2326)|
| 0:38:52| have background information on the task force members, but we absolutely need to get that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2332)|
| 0:38:58| council members. Council, you should have received that from Dr. Lomax yesterday that supplemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2338)|
| 0:39:05| the information provided in the packet. I'm sorry. I'm asking questions at this time. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2345)|
| 0:39:11| We did receive the resumes, but we didn't receive an explanation of any criteria that was reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2351)|
| 0:39:20| when making selection. We didn't discuss, you know, I didn't, you know, really what the role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2360)|
| 0:39:30| of these individuals would be. If their role is fundraising, it seems we would highlight their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2370)|
| 0:39:37| fundraising experience. I have very much concerns about who fills this committee. Depending on who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2377)|
| 0:39:45| on this committee, the work can go in multiple directions, and we need the right people on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2385)|
| 0:39:51| committee. I'm very concerned about Bill Lyons on the committee. Bill Lyons is someone who's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2391)|
| 0:39:59| in a position to address the concerns that led to this resolution and was not able to do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2399)|
| 0:40:08| during his time serving the city. And I think it's absolutely fair for this city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2408)|
| 0:40:15| and for any members of the public to ask what would he do different on this committee versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| what he did during his 25 years of experience. And I'm happy for Mr. Lyons to answer that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2421)|
| 0:40:29| if he would like to come to the podium. Thank you, Ms. Parker. Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2429)|
| 0:40:37| Oh, Council Member Smith. I'm sorry. I have a question for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2437)|
| 0:40:44| Is it right to say that any funds, local funds authorized from the city's budget would have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2444)|
| 0:40:51| come through this body before it's appropriated to whatever recommendations come before this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| Yes, it would. So, in other words, this council would have oversight of how those funds are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| dispersed? Of course, yes. The second is, you know, I don't, I just received resumes and information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2459)|
| 0:41:07| that everybody else received yesterday, so I had barely enough time to read over it myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| but I think the resolution, if I recall those, required it to be comprised of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2471)|
| 0:41:17| community, financial, education, faith, health care, youth, and city leaders. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2477)|
| 0:41:23| that's a pretty diverse group of folks, and I know some of the folks on this task force, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2483)|
| 0:41:28| I can check off a few boxes from those categories there, but those are pretty broad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| and I think intentionally so. So, just as a recollection for the type of person we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| looking for and the qualifications that were in the resolution that were required to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| and be held to, those are outlined in the original resolution. And I would just say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| generally speaking, we review or approve wholesale committees or task force in other ways as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2508)|
| 0:41:55| I don't necessarily know everybody on those that we approve, but I do know some of these folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2515)|
| 0:42:00| and the folks that I do know, I would trust to do well by the city for this really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2520)|
| 0:42:07| task. For those that I don't know, obviously there is a bit of collective trust that the body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2527)|
| 0:42:13| and the sum, the parts are better than the individual. So, just generally speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2533)|
| 0:42:19| this is not out of character for us to do this, and it's a very worthy effort, and I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2539)|
| 0:42:25| this is a pretty comprehensive set of requirements for a task force to pursue this. Those are my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2545)|
| 0:42:32| comments for now. Thank you, Council Member Smith. Vice Mayor? So, at this point, I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2552)|
| 0:42:40| certain that we want to have each task force member come up and be questioned, if you will. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2560)|
| 0:42:46| do feel like each person offers quite a bit, brings a lot to the table as it relates to collectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2566)|
| 0:42:53| being able to work together, identify, of course, we already know where the majority of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2573)|
| 0:42:59| disparities are, but also to be able to make recommendations and to look at existing agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2579)|
| 0:43:06| that are already operating in these lanes, and also where are the gaps, and I think that is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| most important part of this task force. And so, those members that were selected were people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2591)|

| 0:43:41| around, it sounded maybe the character, trustworthiness of the character, and I think them being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2621)|
| 0:43:51| task force members being compared to Brett Kavanaugh. I am not aware of, and I don't personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2631)|

| 0:44:04| anything of that nature that would prevent them from serving. Just like city council members, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| don't go through background checks, so I don't think that it would be fair for us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| put any of the task force members through that type of scrutiny as well. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2654)|
| 0:44:21| Yeah, I just want to say I really appreciate their willingness to serve. These are very busy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| talented people volunteering their time for volunteer role to help our community, and I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2666)|
| 0:44:32| a lot of confidence that when they start to meet, they will be able to define and help clarify the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2672)|
| 0:44:39| role of this task force. That's one of the first tasks before them, so I look forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2679)|
| 0:44:45| to that. Council Member Ryder? Yeah, I just wanted to clarify, so many of the boards of volunteers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2685)|
| 0:44:53| that work with different aspects in the city work with different staff within the city staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2693)|
| 0:45:02| Yes. So will they be working with Mr. Lomax or someone within his staff, and are there other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| staff members that will be involved? Yeah, Dr. Lomax is the main liaison on behalf of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2707)|
| 0:45:13| and probably someone from the law department also will be available to help, and you know, we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2713)|
| 0:45:20| see what other needs arise. Okay, thank you for clarification. Okay, Council Member Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2720)|
| 0:45:29| I just wanted to clarify that when we were considering the sports authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2729)|
| 0:45:36| which at this point would be managing a 65 million dollar project, we were able to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2736)|
| 0:45:43| them very direct questions, each sports authority member, and so this committee is projected to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2743)|
| 0:45:51| manage a much larger amount of money, and so my expectation would be that we would be able to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2751)|
| 0:45:57| them questions. For instance, Mr. Lyons is a very public figure and has recently written an opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2757)|
| 0:46:05| in the Knoxville News Sentinel, where he states that the last 25 years have been a great time for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2765)|

| 0:46:17| areas, and core neighborhoods, and I can go on. Part of the reason this resolution passed to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2777)|
| 0:46:25| the African-American Equity Task Force, Equity Restoration Task Force, is because Black communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2785)|
| 0:46:34| are suffering a 42% poverty rate in this community that has continued to rise over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2794)|
| 0:46:41| and those in power, those who have had decision-making power over our development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2801)|
| 0:46:48| processes over the last few years, have not made that a priority, have not made that 42%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2808)|
| 0:46:53| a priority, and have been a part of the disinvestment that has happened in our neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2813)|
| 0:46:59| so I think it's very fair to ask someone with that background how they plan to pursue the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2819)|
| 0:47:07| differently to prevent the same gentrification, disinvestment, growing poverty rate that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2827)|
| 0:47:14| seen in our communities while that person's been in leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2834)|
| 0:47:20| Council Member Fugate. Thank you, Mayor. I just want to clarify once again, this task force doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2840)|
| 0:47:27| have oversight over spending any money. Any money that is spent is City Council, so I'm correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2847)|
| 0:47:39| right? I mean, that's correct. They will come with recommendations, perhaps proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2859)|
| 0:47:46| that City Council will fully vet, so this body does not have authority over money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2866)|
| 0:47:54| Correct. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=2874)|

| 1:01:48| so we'll call on them and then hear your discussion. The first person signed up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| is Kevin Andrews, Mr. Andrews. You could come to the podium, state your name and address for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3713)|

| 1:02:22| I want to start out by saying thank you to Councilwoman Parker for introducing this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3742)|
| 1:02:27| It is long overdue. Since Anthony Thompson, Jr. If you could start just by stating your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3747)|
| 1:02:33| name and address for the record, that's okay. My name is Kevin Andrews. I live at 1509 Brown Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3753)|
| 1:02:44| Since Anthony Thompson, Jr. was murdered in April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| I've been coming to these City Council and County Commission meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3767)|

| 1:03:00| This resolution is the first needed step. Knoxville, like every city in this country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3780)|
| 1:03:06| has a long history of racism, and if we're ever going to move past that and build a Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3786)|
| 1:03:12| that serves everyone, we have to reckon with that racism. We have to acknowledge it and we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3792)|
| 1:03:21| work to dismantle it. To do that, we need explicit, targeted efforts to remove racism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3801)|
| 1:03:29| and racist individuals from our government, notably our police department. When public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3809)|
| 1:03:37| servants like our police are repeatedly reported as being racist, as harassing our neighbors of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3817)|
| 1:03:43| color, even harassing their own black co-workers, as was reported in Knox News recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3823)|
| 1:03:50| these public servants need to be held accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3830)|
| 1:03:56| But the policies as they stand today are inadequate in dealing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3836)|
| 1:04:04| The only way to achieve true accountability in our government is a zero-tolerance policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3844)|
| 1:04:12| and the only way to stand against racism is to do so unilaterally and unwaveringly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3852)|
| 1:04:19| Please stand with Councilwoman Parker and your neighbors crying for justice in support of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3859)|
| 1:04:25| resolution. Thank you. Next person signed up to speak to this is Sam Emmons. Mr. Emmons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3865)|
| 1:04:35| if you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3875)|
| 1:04:40| Hi, good evening. I'm Sam Emmons, and I live at 301 Woodlawn Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3880)|
| 1:04:49| I'm here to just weigh in a little bit on this agenda item. And first, I'm willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3889)|
| 1:04:56| stand corrected on my thoughts about this if I'm off base, truly. So I'm going to start with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3896)|
| 1:05:05| if I'm off base, truly. Second, I'm against the proposed zero-tolerance policy resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3905)|
| 1:05:15| presented to Council this evening. It's my understanding that a zero-tolerance policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3915)|
| 1:05:21| implies that each instance of an offense receives a punishment no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3921)|
| 1:05:28| According to an Indiana Education Policy Center report published in 2000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| zero-tolerance discipline attempts to send a message by punishing both major and minor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3933)|
| 1:05:41| incidents severely. In a school setting, the study found that there is little evidence that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3941)|
| 1:05:48| such policies result in, and I quote, improved student behavior or overall school safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3948)|
| 1:05:55| Zero-tolerance is distinct from a policy in which discipline is matched to the level of the offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3955)|
| 1:06:04| It's meant to set a harsh example. And in schools, from what I've read, it's been suggested that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3964)|
| 1:06:12| zero-tolerance policies regarding violence and alcohol or drug possession on school grounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3972)|
| 1:06:19| contribute to a so-called school-to-prison pipeline. So it makes me wonder for what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3979)|
| 1:06:28| purpose this resolution proposes something known to be an opposite of restorative justice practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3988)|
| 1:06:37| What good does a zero-tolerance policy do or add to the management of our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=3997)|
| 1:06:44| even if targeting bad things? If there are shortcomings in the current procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4004)|
| 1:06:52| to correct wrongs, let those procedures be reviewed or amended so that the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4012)|
| 1:06:59| of those procedures is carried out correctly. If imperfect people imperfectly implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4019)|
| 1:07:07| imperfect procedures, then let's aim to refine the way we carry out justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4027)|
| 1:07:15| instead of replacing those methods with an iron fist. If one opposes this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4035)|
| 1:07:24| someone might say that implies one tolerates racism. It doesn't. That ignores that if there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4044)|
| 1:07:33| are already disciplinary measures in place that could be effective. Using appropriately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| leveled disciplinary action is not to be construed as tolerating an offense. Proper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4058)|
| 1:07:45| discipline is aimed at bringing justice in accordance with the level of wrong that's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4065)|
| 1:07:51| done and with the goal of correcting the direction of the offender where possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4071)|
| 1:07:58| Some might argue that, on the other hand, every act that could be viewed under the purview of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4078)|
| 1:08:08| this resolution is major. How dare I say an offense in this category could be anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4088)|
| 1:08:17| even remotely less than major? But that's not an objective way of viewing justice and wrongdoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4097)|
| 1:08:25| Countries have used this kind of argument to use severe corporal punishment on petty theft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4105)|
| 1:08:32| for example. It's vindictive. It's wrathful. It's not measured, considerate, or effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4112)|
| 1:08:41| And for these reasons, I don't support the proposed resolution. If what I've described| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4121)|
| 1:08:47| is not the intent of the resolution, it could be changed. Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4127)|
| 1:08:56| Thank you, Mr. Emmons. Councilmember...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| I'd love to speak about the resolution, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| Okay. If you turn your light on, that always helps me be able to recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| I thought the person who introduced the resolution usually got to introduce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| I just wanted to... You just usually left your light on to make me aware that you wish to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4152)|
| 1:09:17| But yeah, you make the motion, and I'm calling on you first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| Thank you. And thank you to the public forum speakers. I really appreciated your feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4160)|
| 1:09:29| The zero tolerance policies in schools was certain... That certainly came to mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| when drafting this policy. And I want to tell you how, in my mind, it's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4174)|
| 1:09:41| One way is that, you know, in educational environments, we're working with young| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4181)|
| 1:09:48| children who are still developing, who are still learning. And we need to have grace when it comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4188)|
| 1:09:55| to their mistakes and create safe learning environments for them. And so I'm opposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| those zero tolerance policies. We also just, as you said, often create that pipeline straight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4199)|
| 1:10:05| to prison from school for children by implementing those policies. In this situation, we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4205)|
| 1:10:11| about HR policies, employment policies. And many of the goals of this policy would already be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4211)|
| 1:10:23| captured in our federal law. My concern is that the way our policies and practices are carried out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4223)|
| 1:10:32| it's not... It's not resulting in a zero tolerance policy. And therefore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4232)|
| 1:10:39| we are not creating a culture where harassment and discrimination is not tolerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4239)|
| 1:10:46| One example I like to share is when looking at racial profiling. We have police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4246)|
| 1:10:53| who've been found by a court of law to have engaged in racial profiling who were able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4253)|
| 1:10:59| stay on our force. Imagine if we had a police officer found by a court of law to have hidden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4259)|
| 1:11:07| evidence on someone and still remained on our police force. Would they have the trust of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4267)|
| 1:11:13| community if they had engaged in activities like that? My concern is that for racial minorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4273)|
| 1:11:22| racial discrimination, racial... Any sort of harassment is an act of violence towards us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4282)|
| 1:11:29| but it's not treated as an act of violence. And so we need to... When implementing our policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4289)|
| 1:11:37| on how to create safe work environments, we have to take sexism and racism more seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4297)|
| 1:11:44| If these become behaviors that simply result in warning after warning, we're not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4304)|
| 1:11:52| be able to create the safe work environments that I know that we all want to create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4312)|
| 1:11:58| And one thing I was able to discuss with our fabulous new HR director, Dr. Drummond, briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4318)|
| 1:12:08| before this meeting was, you know, beyond what we currently have in policy, I want us to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4328)|
| 1:12:18| ways that we can trigger systemic reviews. So if we have multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4338)|
| 1:12:26| employees coming forward complaining about hostile work environments, complaining about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4346)|
| 1:12:34| complaints that have been ignored, we should be able to have a process in place that triggers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4354)|
| 1:12:41| a systemic review that looks at how have complaints by our officers of color been treated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4361)|
| 1:12:48| compared to our white officers? What has been the discipline doled out? Do we have a pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4368)|
| 1:12:56| of relying on warnings and not escalating the discipline? I believe that we cannot just say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4376)|
| 1:13:03| we have systems in place. When we have multiple reports concerning reports coming out from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4383)|
| 1:13:11| employees, we must take additional steps to send the message that we will not tolerate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4391)|
| 1:13:18| harassment and discrimination in city government, that we will take additional steps to review our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4398)|
| 1:13:25| practices and policies to ensure that they're up to date. One thing that we talked about briefly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4405)|
| 1:13:32| Dr. Drummond and I, was can we tweak our language to make it a bit stronger and more up to date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4412)|
| 1:13:38| now that we do have a new HR director? I think that there's work that we can do. And then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4418)|
| 1:13:44| next step I would like to take beyond that is crafting whatever results from that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4424)|
| 1:13:52| and then codifying it into our code of ordinances. And for me, that brings the policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4432)|
| 1:14:00| you know, out of the administrative rules, out of the general orders, out of these places where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| they're tucked away, puts it front and center as a shared value of the entire city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4445)|
| 1:14:10| government that can not easily be changed. It's not a policy that a supervisor can come in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4450)|
| 1:14:17| change and say, you know, we're just going to issue warnings here. And maybe they even say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4457)|
| 1:14:24| that's their commitment to restorative justice, but really there's no restoration that happens in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4464)|
| 1:14:29| the end. So that's the direction I would like us to move in is to review our policies, to see if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4469)|
| 1:14:38| we need to have a systemic review, a policy in place that would automatically trigger that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| systemic review, and then codify that into an ordinance. And what the role of tonight's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4483)|
| 1:14:51| resolution is, is to start that conversation. I did not want to propose a policy tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4491)|
| 1:14:58| I wanted to start a conversation that allowed city departments to report back to us so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4498)|
| 1:15:08| the policy that is proposed would be informed by the work that they do and ultimately, hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4508)|
| 1:15:18| would strengthen our efforts to ensure there's no tolerance for racism and sexism among our workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4518)|
| 1:15:25| Thank you, Councilmember Parker. The next three lights are Councilmember Fugitt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4525)|
| 1:15:31| Vice Mayor McKenzie, and Councilmember Singh. Go ahead, Ms. Fugitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4531)|
| 1:15:35| Thank you, Mayor. My colleagues received before the meeting a substitute motion that I intend to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4535)|
| 1:15:45| I want to talk about why I'm intending to make that and also read it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4545)|
| 1:15:51| First of all, I want to make a substitute motion because I understand how important this work is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4551)|
| 1:16:03| I think we can all agree that nobody on City Council, nobody that works in the Mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4563)|
| 1:16:09| believes that sexism and racism are okay. They're absolutely not and we can't tolerate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4569)|
| 1:16:17| My substitute motion revolves around taking zero tolerance out of the resolution because as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4577)|
| 1:16:29| former member of the Board of Education, zero tolerance is hard to describe, not easy to enforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4589)|
| 1:16:41| and causes a lot of confusion among folks when things aren't handled equally. So, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4601)|
| 1:16:51| there was a zero tolerance policy about weapons on campus, knives in particular. There were children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4611)|
| 1:17:00| being suspended because they had a plastic knife in their lunchbox because it was a knife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4620)|
| 1:17:08| That's not the same thing as another kind of knife, but a zero tolerance policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4628)|
| 1:17:14| caused great confusion and did not allow for varying degrees of discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4634)|
| 1:17:22| The other reason I want to bring this resolution tonight is because I want to make it clear that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4642)|
| 1:17:32| all employees of the City of Knoxville work for the Mayor and they are tied to employment policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4652)|
| 1:17:44| crafted by the City of Knoxville and or the Civil Service Merit Board. We created a year ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4664)|
| 1:17:53| an HR department. We have a very qualified HR director, Dr. Drummond, and my resolution reads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4673)|
| 1:18:00| that the City Council requests that the Mayor and her staff...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| Do you want to make the, are you making a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| I'm making a motion to substitute this, but I suppose I had to read it so people would know if they could second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4685)|
| 1:18:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4694)|
| 1:18:15| Did you send it to people? I think...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| Yes, yes, it's been passed out. Everybody has it at their desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| Okay, why don't you make the motion, a substitute motion, and then if there's a second then you can read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| Is there...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4704)|
| 1:18:25| Well, okay, everybody's seen it. I've made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4705)|
| 1:18:30| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4710)|
| 1:18:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4710)|
| 1:18:31| Okay, substitute motion made by Council Member Fugate has been made and there's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4711)|
| 1:18:36| Do you want to read it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4716)|
| 1:18:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4717)|

| 1:20:26| more and then I'll be quiet. I think this is the right path. It involves the right departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4826)|
| 1:20:34| We do have employees that have civil service protection in their job, and we need to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4834)|
| 1:20:42| sure that any policies that we change are fully vetted, and so that's why I want these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4842)|
| 1:20:50| involved in the review of this. Thank you, Council Member Fugate. Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4850)|
| 1:20:57| So, a couple of questions. I'd like to ask Director Drummond if you are aware of any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4857)|
| 1:21:03| current zero tolerance policies that are currently in place in the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4863)|
| 1:21:09| departments. Within the City of Knoxville, we have no zero tolerance policies that are in place at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4869)|
| 1:21:17| this point. Yeah, even from a civil service perspective in that line there are no zero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4877)|
| 1:21:26| tolerance. That is correct. We have rules and procedures that prohibit behaviors, but there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4886)|
| 1:21:33| are no words that say zero tolerance. That is correct. So, Director Drummond, in your professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4893)|
| 1:21:39| opinion, zero tolerance would be defined as an incident or any type of behavior, and let's go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4899)|
| 1:21:49| with let's go in the vein of racism that is substantiated or any practices. Zero tolerance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4909)|
| 1:21:56| would mean, what would that definition mean to you as a professional, HR professional? When we look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4916)|
| 1:22:02| at zero tolerance from an HR perspective, we consider it as a typically a result in termination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4922)|
| 1:22:09| So, it is a definite offense that occurs normally at the first infraction based on what the zero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4929)|
| 1:22:16| tolerance is for. So, when you look at that, it's automatic punishment with no managerial discretion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4936)|
| 1:22:24| but it is an automatic termination or automatic decision on the discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4944)|
| 1:22:34| That would be after investigation has been substantiated. That is correct. However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4954)|
| 1:22:43| when you look at zero tolerance in many cases, it goes into effect that you will have issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4963)|
| 1:22:51| that there's zero tolerance, and while there's an allegation the individual is in that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4971)|
| 1:22:58| you will do the investigation, but if it is founded or grounded, then that individual will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4978)|
| 1:23:03| be terminated. In our current civil service system, if an individual is found to be that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4983)|
| 1:23:11| that has occurred, then they have the right to appeal the decision of discipline at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4991)|
| 1:23:18| In the event that the city were to go to zero tolerance policies in certain areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=4998)|
| 1:23:25| where would civil service come into play, or would it negate civil service in the appeal process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5005)|
| 1:23:32| According to, and I'm going to look to our legal team on this, you cannot negate the civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5012)|
| 1:23:39| process that currently exists. So, at this point, the way that it works is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5019)|
| 1:23:47| if an employee, and I'm talking about civil service employees, if they are demoted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5027)|
| 1:23:54| if they're suspended, or if they're terminated, they have automatic right to appeal. So, that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5034)|
| 1:24:00| something that is granted by charter, that they have that right to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5040)|
| 1:24:06| And so, our departments that are protected under civil service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5046)|
| 1:24:11| could you? KPD is civil service, and fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5051)|
| 1:24:18| All departments, when we look at general government and uniformed employees, are covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5058)|
| 1:24:25| under civil service. There are about 90%, 95% of our employees are not protected under civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5065)|
| 1:24:33| service status. And those are the departments or the individuals that are appointed through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5073)|
| 1:24:38| their mayor. I'm sorry? Do you mean just the opposite, 95% are protected by civil service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5078)|
| 1:24:44| Yes. Did I say are protected? Thank you. Are protected under civil service. Thank you. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5084)|
| 1:24:49| only about 5% are not protected under civil service. Thank you, Councilman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5089)|
| 1:24:56| Okay. So, in the event that council did go in the direction of zero tolerance, what would it take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5096)|
| 1:25:05| how would that impact civil service? And that would take an ordinance change as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5105)|
| 1:25:09| Oh, that's beyond an ordinance change to take away civil service status and civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5109)|
| 1:25:16| rights. That is something that would have to be a chartered change to take away those protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5116)|
| 1:25:24| All right. Thank you. Yes, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| Councilmember Singh, and then Smith, and then Ryder, and then I'm going to go back to Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5127)|
| 1:25:34| Thank you, Mayor. I seconded the resolution that Councilwoman Parker brought forward because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5134)|
| 1:25:43| need to have this discussion. But I do not, I am not in favor of zero tolerance policy. I've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5143)|
| 1:25:50| that do too much harm. So, I appreciate Councilwoman Fugate's alternative resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5150)|
| 1:25:59| and that is what I would be in favor of. Okay. Councilmember Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5159)|
| 1:26:09| Dr. Drummond, who is not covered by civil service, the 5%, as an example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5169)|
| 1:26:15| Those individuals. Roles, not names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| Yes. The Director of Human Resources is not covered. So, let me say that very specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5177)|
| 1:26:25| But we are looking at appointments by the Mayor, the Deputy Directors, your Executive Assistants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5185)|
| 1:26:31| are not covered. And there are a handful of positions that are not covered under civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5191)|
| 1:26:37| service. Okay. So, all of our entry-level positions? Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5197)|
| 1:26:43| Public works, uniformed services? Are covered by civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5203)|
| 1:26:48| Okay. Thank you. I just wanted some clarity for everyone on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5208)|
| 1:26:51| Yes, ma'am. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| Okay. Thank you. Ms. Singh, did you have a follow-up question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| I do. I do. Who is going to determine what sexist and racist behavior is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5216)|
| 1:27:02| Yeah, that's a good question. And I think I'm really glad to have an HR professional who can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5222)|
| 1:27:10| help us sift through that. First, I just want to give a couple comments. First, I want to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5230)|
| 1:27:17| Councilmembers for supporting the creation of an HR department. I'm really grateful to have Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5237)|
| 1:27:22| Drummond here to help us walk through these challenging issues. She started in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5242)|
| 1:27:27| and just in the last seven months has put together an HR department. And I've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5247)|
| 1:27:33| asked her, and she's already started reviewing all of our policies, and will continue to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5253)|
| 1:27:38| so continuously, but with a particular focus on, if this passes this evening, on sexism and racism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5258)|
| 1:27:45| which are already sort of in progress. And obviously, I do not condone racism or sexism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5265)|
| 1:27:51| I do not tolerate them. And I want to make sure that our city employment practices and policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5271)|
| 1:27:56| reflect that. We all want a workplace that's inclusive and fair and equitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5276)|
| 1:28:02| So yeah, your question, I can't answer that question. Those are difficult definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5282)|
| 1:28:08| Dr. Drummond, if you have an answer for how those things are defined, and I mean, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5288)|
| 1:28:13| I'll let you try to answer that. I was trying to pull the exact laws that do that, but I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5293)|
| 1:28:20| pull it out right for you right now. But it is covered under federal statute. And when we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5300)|
| 1:28:26| about EEO, what is included, the Equal Opportunity, Equal Employment Opportunity Act, we look at those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5306)|
| 1:28:34| types of things. So discrimination for sexual and for race is defined as those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5314)|
| 1:28:42| And it speaks specifically, employment deals with race, color, gender, age, religion, national origin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5322)|
| 1:28:50| ethnic origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, creed, genetic information, and disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5330)|
| 1:28:57| So when we start looking at those things, they're covered under federal law, and the state has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5337)|
| 1:29:03| additional laws as well. But it's covered under federal statute. We can get you the specific statutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5343)|
| 1:29:11| That's just saying who's covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5351)|
| 1:29:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5356)|
| 1:29:16| So what is the definition of sexism or sexist or racist behavior?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5356)|
| 1:29:21| Well, when we look at the definition, we have in our current administrative rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5361)|
| 1:29:27| to talk about what is prohibited. And you cannot discriminate against, it is prohibited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5367)|
| 1:29:33| against anyone based on those particular. When we look at sexual harassment, we talk specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5373)|
| 1:29:41| about what harassment looks like. So that is covered under administrative rule 1.06 as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5381)|
| 1:29:51| Okay. So discrimination is the point. So what about sexist and racist comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5391)|
| 1:29:58| That's not discriminatory behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5398)|
| 1:30:02| Discriminatory behavior may include sexual comments and will include racial comments as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5402)|
| 1:30:11| So when you look at it, you will take it into consideration under what is the situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5411)|
| 1:30:18| has it been pervasive, if it's reoccurring, and those types of things. So you will look at those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5418)|
| 1:30:25| when you investigate this, and it will be investigated through civil service. So let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5425)|
| 1:30:31| make sure I state that the complaint comes in through the law department or to civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5431)|
| 1:30:36| And when those things occur, they will be investigated with the help of KPD as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5436)|
| 1:30:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5445)|
| 1:30:46| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5446)|
| 1:30:47| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| Well, I just wanted to clarify for my resolution, there's no discussion of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5449)|
| 1:30:56| it's a very simple resolution just to start the conversation, but there's no suggestion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5456)|
| 1:31:03| civil service would not have a role to play in this. This is why I list, you know, simply state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5463)|
| 1:31:10| at the various departments, because all relevant departments should be a part of this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5470)|
| 1:31:16| And the effort is not to remove civil service protections. I fought very hard last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5476)|
| 1:31:23| making sure that those were not being threatened. So I'm very much in support of them. And,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5483)|
| 1:31:30| you know, I have a feeling that this alternative resolution is going to pass and not my resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5490)|
| 1:31:35| And I find that very unfortunate, disappointing, and another disingenuous move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5495)|
| 1:31:41| by our city council. I really wanted to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5501)|
| 1:31:52| move an initiative forward that would have us engage in a process that sent a message to city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5512)|
| 1:31:58| staff. The current resolution before us from Councilwoman Fugate is just more of the status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5518)|
| 1:32:07| quo. It is essentially saying that we have policies in place. And even though we continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5527)|
| 1:32:13| to have complaints come forward from our employees, it does not concern us. We still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5533)|
| 1:32:20| believe our policies are enough. We will take a quick check, see if we can strengthen it a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5540)|
| 1:32:26| bit, but for the most part, we're going to stick with our own policies. I think we need new policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5546)|
| 1:32:32| We need new language, and we need to be sending a new message in order to shift a culture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5552)|
| 1:32:38| that would embarrass the city if I went through the list of things that have been reported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5558)|
| 1:32:43| publicly that our police officers have done, who are currently still on the force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5563)|
| 1:32:51| I mean, I can name people who pulled me over personally and committed violations in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5571)|
| 1:32:58| moment, but I have no one to go to to report that to, no one the claims are not going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5578)|
| 1:33:03| followed up on. I'm sitting across from our chief of police, who I've made complaints about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5583)|
| 1:33:10| and her handling of prior cases, not followed up completely. So it's a wonder why our public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5590)|
| 1:33:17| doesn't have faith in our police currently. And it's a wonder why our public doesn't have faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5597)|
| 1:33:25| in our city government, that they're going to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| about these complaints that we continue to read about in the newspaper. It's sad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5608)|
| 1:33:37| Thank you, Councilmember Parker. Councilmember Testerman's light's not working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5617)|
| 1:33:41| but I saw that you wanted to speak, so. Thank you, Mayor. A, I just commend Councilmember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5621)|
| 1:33:49| Fugate for the alternative resolution. And, you know, I think for a few reasons, in the sense that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5629)|
| 1:33:56| you know, zero tolerance, I mean, again, it goes back to what is the definition of that. And,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5636)|
| 1:34:05| you know, it hasn't proven to be effective because, in effect, you're leading by fear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5645)|
| 1:34:12| and which leads to toxic cultures, it leads to mediocre performance, and anxiety is the enemy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5652)|
| 1:34:22| of logic. And so, be it decision making or impunitive environments, I mean, it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5662)|
| 1:34:31| it's demoralizing, it stifles communication, and it just, it really inhibits the ability for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5671)|
| 1:34:40| best and the brightest to rise. I mean, just from, you know, and more importantly, I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5680)|
| 1:34:48| don't feel like it's within our purview, and to the very point that the Mayor, to Dr. Drummond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5688)|
| 1:34:54| to the Civil Service Merit Board, that is their purview. And, again, back to that, I think we all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5694)|
| 1:35:04| take this very seriously. But, again, I think codes of conduct, you know, need to be taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5704)|
| 1:35:13| seriously, but I strongly feel that zero tolerance is not productive, it's not effective, and it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5713)|
| 1:35:20| in effect, counterproductive. So, again, I support the substitute resolution because I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5720)|
| 1:35:28| the best, is the best path forward. Thank you, Councilmember Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5728)|
| 1:35:36| Vice Mayor McKenzie. Thank you, Mayor. I most definitely understand the spirit in which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5736)|
| 1:35:43| Councilmember Parker brought this resolution, given what we've read, what we have heard from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5743)|
| 1:35:51| you know, members of specifically KPD regarding racist allegations and incidents that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5751)|
| 1:35:57| occurred. There has to be some, something has to change. There has to be some type of mechanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5757)|
| 1:36:03| in place that is going to be very clear, other than words written on a piece of paper, that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5763)|
| 1:36:09| don't tolerate certain behaviors and cultures. And we have not, we have not seen that to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5769)|
| 1:36:17| And so, with that said, I'd like to see what can we pull from one resolution to the other. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5777)|
| 1:36:26| sounds like if we go with zero tolerance, that is going to, in some regards, undermine civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5786)|
| 1:36:32| service. But we have to do, we have to change something in how we are not policing people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5792)|
| 1:36:39| But the rules that regulate these types of offenses that create more than anxiety to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5799)|
| 1:36:46| of color, people who find themselves in these situations of harassment, sexism, but are somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5806)|
| 1:36:54| afraid to even stand up and report some of those things for fear of either retaliation, or they'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5814)|
| 1:37:01| be ostracized, or it will be a work environment that we could say is hostile, but if it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5821)|
| 1:37:07| outward, can you prove that? But people know when you go to work and then you get those looks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5827)|
| 1:37:13| the atmosphere is different. And most of us sitting around this table, people of color, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5833)|
| 1:37:18| understand that. We get that because we've experienced it at some point in our professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5838)|
| 1:37:24| careers and otherwise. And so, I absolutely feel like we need to do something. We need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5844)|
| 1:37:30| aggressive in how we do that, because what we have in place currently does not seem to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5850)|
| 1:37:35| hitting the mark. And so, whatever that looks like, I think we need to, we need to say, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5855)|
| 1:37:43| know, I'm in favor of it. So, I want to defer back to Councilmember Parker to see, is there anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5863)|
| 1:37:48| in what is, what was presented by Councilmember Fugate that could be pulled over into her resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5868)|
| 1:37:58| I mean, I'm honestly not married to the word zero tolerance. I'm married to the culture of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5878)|
| 1:38:06| zero tolerance. So, you know, one question I would have is, I'm sure there are offenses that city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5886)|
| 1:38:15| employees could commit that would result in an automatic termination, and that supervisor would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5895)|
| 1:38:23| not have the discretion. Like, if they were found guilty of murder by a court of law, there must| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5903)|
| 1:38:32| be something in our policies that says, you know, if this happens, supervisor, you have no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5912)|
| 1:38:39| discretion in this situation. Can you think of any situations like that in our current policies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5919)|
| 1:38:46| Dr. Drummond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| Yes, ma'am. When we look at that, the current policies do not specifically address that. But what it does say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5928)|
| 1:38:58| that if there is an egregious situation, that the supervisor has the right to immediate termination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5938)|
| 1:39:07| So, when you look at this, you can have a situation where you can terminate an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5947)|
| 1:39:14| What I'm going to say to you is that a supervisor would, I would recommend as the director of HR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5954)|
| 1:39:21| that they're going to work with the legal department, work with us, and before they make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5961)|
| 1:39:25| that decision. But the supervisor has that ability to immediately go to termination if the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5965)|
| 1:39:33| is severe enough. But I need to make sure that you understand that even in that situation, even in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5973)|
| 1:39:40| that situation, that we have a civil service policy that allows for that employee to appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5980)|
| 1:39:48| that decision. Now, do I think it will be upheld? Absolutely, given an egregious situation. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5988)|
| 1:39:56| we do, supervisors have that right to do that. Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=5996)|
| 1:40:00| And so, what I want is a, you know, I wanted to start a conversation about how can we shift our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6000)|
| 1:40:07| policies to create a zero tolerance culture? If you, you know, I think having zero tolerance in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6007)|
| 1:40:15| the policy would send a message, but if folks don't like those words, we don't have to put the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6015)|
| 1:40:19| words in there, but we need a policy that removes that discretion from supervisors. And one reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6019)|
| 1:40:28| I wanted to start with the study is to see if supervisors are using their discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6028)|
| 1:40:34| too often in instances of racism and sexism to give those lower level, you know, forms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6034)|
| 1:40:44| discipline. That's why I asked to start with the study. I didn't want to make assumptions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6044)|
| 1:40:50| what is currently happening. Let's get to the root of what is currently happening. I think it's about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6050)|
| 1:40:56| the discretion of supervisors, but let's get to the root of it and see if we can make changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6056)|
| 1:41:02| that would shift the culture from not taking racism, acts of racism and sexism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6062)|
| 1:41:08| as seriously as we need supervisors to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6068)|
| 1:41:15| Ms. Fugett has her light on. Oh, no, I'm just finishing my thought. Sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6075)|
| 1:41:20| because Vice Mayor McKenzie asked a question about if there's a way to merge the two proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6080)|
| 1:41:29| and, you know, for me, the main, you know, one of the issues is that my proposal asks for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6089)|
| 1:41:48| for the administration to return with information that could inform an ordinance. And I see that as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6108)|
| 1:41:56| the end, you know, end result of this process rather than the policies remaining. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6116)|
| 1:42:05| my concern is the general orders might approach it a certain way. The administrative rule will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6125)|
| 1:42:10| approach it a certain way. And there's no clear culture being developed across departments that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6130)|
| 1:42:17| we do not tolerate. That's my concern. Thank you, Ms. Parker. Ms. Fugett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6137)|
| 1:42:24| Thank you. I assure you that I take racism and sexism very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6144)|
| 1:42:35| One of those I have not experienced, one of those I have. So, you know, it's real and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6155)|
| 1:42:44| appreciate the severity of it. What I'm trying to accomplish in this resolution is something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6164)|
| 1:42:52| directs the exact right people to work on this, bring us back a report and recommendations. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6172)|
| 1:43:00| that doesn't mean that we can't act differently on what they bring us. I'm just not prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6180)|
| 1:43:08| right now to say that what they bring us has to go in an ordinance. I want to hear what the reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6188)|
| 1:43:16| are, what recommendations are about how other cities do things. You know, the report on how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6196)|
| 1:43:23| discipline is meted out seems to be a part of what this would be with policies and procedures. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6203)|
| 1:43:30| I thought what my substitute resolution did is capture the spirit of what Ms. Parker was trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6210)|
| 1:43:37| to accomplish by taking out the zero tolerance language that could be misconstrued and confused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6217)|
| 1:43:48| and off-putting to people and just say we are doing a top-to-bottom review with a report to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6228)|
| 1:43:55| this council in 120 days of what our policies are and after these people look at them, what should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6235)|
| 1:44:03| be changed and what other recommendations they might have. So, that is why I made this substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6243)|
| 1:44:11| Thank you, Councilmember Fugge. Council, I support the substitute motion. It's not my role to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6251)|
| 1:44:17| for, but I do want to let you know that I appreciate Ms. Parker bringing this topic to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| council's agenda. I think there's a lot of common ground here and I do not support the using the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6262)|
| 1:44:28| terminology zero tolerance. To me, that reminds me of like mandatory minimums. I do fully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6268)|
| 1:44:36| support better training and ongoing reviews and evaluation for all supervisors throughout the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6276)|
| 1:44:44| so they know how to exercise discretion appropriately with training on how to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6284)|
| 1:44:50| an equitable inclusive workplace and what to do when they are hearing complaints of racism, sexism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6290)|
| 1:44:57| or harassment. That's why we have an HR department and that those trainings are already beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6297)|
| 1:45:02| and I, if you all pass this substitute motion, I will get you a report back within 120 days and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6302)|
| 1:45:11| that's my responsibility to do anyways, but I'd be glad to report back to you all and share what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6311)|
| 1:45:18| I've learned about the policies, what recommended changes we think might be required or have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6318)|
| 1:45:26| already happened, and also how we're implementing those policies because you can have a perfect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6326)|
| 1:45:31| policy, but if they're not implemented effectively, it's only worth the paper it's written on. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6331)|
| 1:45:37| we want to have the right policies, the best practices, and then make sure they're implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6337)|
| 1:45:42| effectively, that all of our employees know about them, know how to report issues, know how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6342)|
| 1:45:50| report, and if they're not getting a response from their immediate supervisor, what to do next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6350)|
| 1:45:56| Because those issues are profound and we need to address them. So thank you both for your,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6356)|
| 1:46:04| you know, proposing these things and again, I think for the most part, they're generally in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6364)|
| 1:46:09| the same direction. So Council Member Parker, your light's on. Just a final comment. I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6369)|
| 1:46:18| just challenge us to sit with our discomfort with attaching zero tolerance to sexism and racism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6378)|
| 1:46:26| You know, it makes sense within a school setting, but we are not talking about a school setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6386)|
| 1:46:32| We are talking about, for the most part, individuals who are armed and have the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6392)|
| 1:46:43| to take our lives. With someone with that much power in our society, we absolutely have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6403)|
| 1:46:51| zero tolerance policies. We absolutely have to hold them to the highest standard. So I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6411)|
| 1:47:00| want us to sit with why the zero tolerance policy, why that language has made this Council so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6420)|
| 1:47:09| uncomfortable. Because, you know, as, you know, if I think of myself as a woman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6429)|
| 1:47:18| if I hear that my colleague that I've worked with raped another colleague that I work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6438)|
| 1:47:26| I will not be able to restore my working relationship with that individual. I will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6446)|
| 1:47:34| interested in that individual being held accountable for his actions. And then I would love for him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6454)|
| 1:47:42| to go through some sort of rehabilitation, whatever. But in my workspace, I'm concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6462)|
| 1:47:48| about my safety, and there are actions that can cross the line and impact my feeling of safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6468)|
| 1:47:58| And so we have to be able to imagine certain actions that are essentially racist and sexist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6478)|
| 1:48:07| being absolutely intolerable. And then us being absolutely willing to say we have zero tolerance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6487)|
| 1:48:16| for that, if that action is committed, that warrants immediate termination. And the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6496)|
| 1:48:23| that we can't even imagine actions that could be committed, that are racist and sexist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6503)|
| 1:48:30| that should warrant immediate termination is very worrisome to me. We're not talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6510)|
| 1:48:38| you know, folks just saying rude comments. We're talking about folks feeling threatened in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6518)|
| 1:48:45| work, unsafe in their body, unable to report offenses to their superiors, or even to the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6525)|
| 1:48:58| of the city of Knoxville. That is seriously concerning, and it should concern us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6538)|
| 1:49:05| And so I just wanted us to sit with that as we think about what type of policies are needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6545)|
| 1:49:12| moving forward to prevent racism and sexism from continuing unabated as it has, especially in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6552)|
| 1:49:22| the Knoxville Police Department. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Rodger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6562)|
| 1:49:32| So I was listening to what Councilwoman Parker just said, and what I heard described was a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6572)|
| 1:49:38| Like if you have a colleague that it's reported that they've committed a rape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6578)|
| 1:49:44| that's not sexism or racism. That's a crime. And I would hope Ms. Drummond or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6584)|
| 1:49:51| Chief Thomas that that is not something that goes unlistened to, and we have any reports of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6591)|
| 1:50:04| So Councilwoman Parker, you're saying you have knowledge of city employees who are having to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6604)|
| 1:50:08| work with people who know that their colleague is a rapist and that information is ignored and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6608)|
| 1:50:14| acknowledged? Yes. And Dr. Drummond, we have no means for anyone to investigate that or report that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6614)|
| 1:50:28| I mean, because that's not sexism or racism. I think it needs to be real clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| It's a sexist culture when it's not. Councilmember Rodger, let's ask Chief Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6632)|
| 1:50:38| if someone has been raped or is a victim of a crime, they call the police and they tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6638)|
| 1:50:45| what the process is because that's a serious crime and we address it right away. It's way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6645)|
| 1:50:50| beyond a workplace harassment issue. That's right. It's investigated as a crime. It's prosecuted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6650)|
| 1:50:57| and we do our best to bring that person to justice. I'm confused as to the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6657)|
| 1:51:04| that you have and why you haven't come forward, Councilwoman Parker, because I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6664)|
| 1:51:08| serious. I have come forward. Okay, well, Councilmember Rodger, I'm not sure what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6668)|
| 1:51:19| talking about. I think there needs to be further discussion about that. That's incredibly disturbing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6679)|
| 1:51:26| because that is not sexism and that is not racism. That is a crime, and I would be screaming from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6686)|
| 1:51:33| hilltops if I knew that that was happening and everyone was ignoring. I myself could sign up for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6693)|
| 1:51:39| a public forum and talk about it if I felt like the powers that be were ignoring that. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6699)|
| 1:51:44| what I'll say about that. Zero tolerance. I'm trying to tread lightly on what I'm going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6704)|
| 1:51:50| I get the sentiment that Councilwoman Parker is going for that we should not be tolerant and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6710)|
| 1:51:57| should be able to be adults and act and have been raised in a certain manner to be decent people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6717)|
| 1:52:04| once we get to the workforce. I know that KPD specifically has zero tolerance for certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6724)|
| 1:52:12| behaviors, and I'm not talking about sexism or racism. I know officers that have been punished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6732)|
| 1:52:17| and had their entire jobs changed and could have been reformed and be good officers doing their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6737)|
| 1:52:25| job again. So that's one of the reasons I have trouble with zero tolerance, and I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6745)|
| 1:52:32| clarify again, not talking about racism, not talking about rape, not talking about sexism. Somebody who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6752)|
| 1:52:39| made a mistake and wasn't truthful about something and I believe could have been rehabilitated and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6759)|
| 1:52:45| be able to work in the role that they had prior, but the policy is of zero tolerance for certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6765)|
| 1:52:50| behaviors, and I disagree with that because I think some people can be rehabilitated and be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6770)|
| 1:52:56| to, you know, be punished and do their job and be back to what they were doing. So that gives me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6776)|
| 1:53:03| some pause to zero tolerance. I think, Councilwoman Parker, what I heard you say is you're not married| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6783)|
| 1:53:09| to the word zero tolerance. I welcome this conversation and maybe it's some clarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6789)|
| 1:53:15| for consequences for certain behaviors and us not accepting and sweeping under the rug certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6795)|
| 1:53:23| behaviors, that we don't accept racism and sexism, but also to be clear again, what I heard described| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6803)|
| 1:53:34| a moment ago is neither. It is criminal behavior and it should no way be ignored. I think, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6814)|
| 1:53:43| hope that things are different now that we have an HR department. I know in my other employer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6823)|
| 1:53:50| we have an HR department and we also talk about see something, say something and sexism and racism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6830)|
| 1:53:59| all the time and we're trained on it. It's not just a hey, you got hired, here's your intro training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6839)|
| 1:54:04| and off you go. We have to talk about it with students non-stop every semester, but we also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6844)|
| 1:54:11| have to be retrained and trained and trained and trained and we're trained on examples and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6851)|
| 1:54:15| more training and we get a lot of training and we talk about it all the time and you know, maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6855)|
| 1:54:20| that's part of what's been missing because different people have maybe misguided cultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6860)|
| 1:54:28| norms that need to be, you know, identified or redirected and maybe that's what we're lacking. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6868)|
| 1:54:34| I hope out of these conversations, we figure out how to address what we've been missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6874)|
| 1:54:39| and address some root issues and I'll stop at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6879)|
| 1:54:45| Thank you, Council Member Ryder. Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6885)|
| 1:54:50| My question was answered, thank you. Okay, Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6890)|
| 1:54:56| So do we or do we not have zero tolerance in any sense of the word in our practices currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6896)|
| 1:55:06| Is that word used in any handbook? Dr. Drummond said the word zero tolerance is not in our current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6906)|
| 1:55:11| policy. Is that correct, Dr. Drummond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| That is correct. We do have rules that state...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6913)|
| 1:55:19| Well, who can... Your microphone is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6919)|
| 1:55:25| I'm not sure what that is. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| We do have rules, in fact, that state certain things are prohibited as a result of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6927)|
| 1:55:35| and the managers or the directors have the ability to determine the appropriate discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6935)|
| 1:55:44| So there are situations that the director has the ability to make that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6944)|
| 1:55:50| but it does not specifically state zero tolerance. We specifically state that things are prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6950)|
| 1:55:57| We specifically state that workplace violence will not be, we will not have that. And that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6957)|
| 1:56:05| in, I'm going to look specifically in Rule 11, specifically about workplace violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6965)|
| 1:56:12| And that is a focus that we have that would be a model to workplace and workplace violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6972)|
| 1:56:19| And I'm going to pull that real quick just to kind of get you there. It is in Administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6979)|
| 1:56:26| Rule 11, and it's in 11.03, and it's in P. The city will not tolerate any violence in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6986)|
| 1:56:35| workplace. Any employee who commits any act of violence in the workplace or threatens to commit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=6995)|
| 1:56:41| any act of violence shall be subject to immediate disciplinary actions up to and including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7001)|
| 1:56:48| termination. But it is not an automatic terminating offense, but it will not be tolerated. It's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7008)|
| 1:56:55| same wording is prohibited. That is the closest that we have in our current language. Is there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7015)|
| 1:57:02| current language as it relates to racism or sexism that has a similar verbiage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7022)|
| 1:57:11| What it states in Administrative Rule 1 and 1.05, the City of Knoxville prohibits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7031)|
| 1:57:21| discrimination in employment on the basis of non-merit factors such as race, color, gender,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7041)|
| 1:57:28| age, religion, national origin, ethnic origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, creed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7048)|
| 1:57:35| genetic information, and disability. And then it also states for harassment is that the city is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7055)|
| 1:57:45| I'm going to read this. The city maintains a strict policy prohibiting sexual harassment of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7065)|
| 1:57:52| any or any harassment based on protected class, and it goes back and restates those again. All forms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7072)|
| 1:57:59| of harassment are strictly prohibited. That is exactly what the current rules state. But that rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7079)|
| 1:58:06| does not state those disciplinary alternatives as was stated in the first context that you read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7086)|
| 1:58:14| It does not state that, but it does say failure to report known harassment may result in disciplinary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7094)|
| 1:58:22| action. And it also states in here after the investigation of a complaint has been completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7102)|
| 1:58:29| and where the facts support the allegations made in the complaint, appropriate disciplinary action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7109)|
| 1:58:35| will be taken up to and including termination. And that is also in that rule 1.06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7115)|
| 1:58:50| Okay. And that's the employee handbook?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7130)|
| 1:58:56| I'm going again. It's not the employee handbook. It is in the Administrative Rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7136)|
| 1:59:02| that all employees receive and when we go through orientation, all employees are notified and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7142)|
| 1:59:12| discuss those rules and specifically talk about harassment and discrimination. Those are discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7152)|
| 1:59:19| specifically in our onboarding orientation process. We are also working to have August 23rd and 24th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7159)|
| 1:59:28| I believe are my correct dates, that we are doing a mandatory training for all current supervisors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7168)|
| 1:59:35| within the city to reinforce all of the rules. I've been here seven months and so we're able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7175)|
| 1:59:43| get this going for the first time August 23rd and 24th. Okay. Director Drummond, if there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7183)|
| 1:59:49| racist allegations that are reported, do those come through your office that you see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7189)|
| 2:00:01| Those do not? Okay. No, ma'am. They come directly to civil service and that is by the, I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7201)|
| 2:00:09| I'm going to get this incorrect, charter or ordinance, but it is, it goes through the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7209)|
| 2:00:14| department or to civil service. Once it's been investigated, then it will come back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7214)|
| 2:00:20| director and it will come to HR to help to determine the level of discipline and that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7220)|
| 2:00:27| one of the things that HR will be able to do is to work with the director and the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7227)|
| 2:00:33| to make decisions to help them to make those decisions about the appropriate discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7233)|
| 2:00:38| So, let me ask a little bit more specifically. So, if there is an allegation in KPD and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7238)|
| 2:00:44| goes to internal affairs, the civil service and HR ever engage in those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7244)|
| 2:00:51| If it is, if you have an issue within the police department, civil service will do the initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7251)|
| 2:00:58| investigation and then it will turn it over to internal affairs to complete the investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7258)|
| 2:01:04| The civil service make any type of disposition or assessment? The decision will be made whether it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7264)|
| 2:01:13| is grounded or whether it's founded or not and, but that is based on the investigation that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7273)|
| 2:01:20| done through internal affairs. Let me, let me step in there just a second. With regard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7280)|
| 2:01:28| discrimination allegations, what happens is if it comes in somewhere else, it is directed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7288)|
| 2:01:35| either to civil service or to law and civil service and law, then we have historically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7295)|
| 2:01:41| worked very cooperatively. If they go first to civil service, typically civil service contacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7301)|
| 2:01:46| law and we work together to do an investigation. If, as a part of that investigation, we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7306)|
| 2:01:52| additional investigation that we're not staffed to do, we may call upon the internal affairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7312)|
| 2:02:01| department from the police department to assist with that investigation, but with regard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7321)|
| 2:02:06| allegations of discrimination, the investigation is under the oversight of the law department and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7326)|
| 2:02:14| the civil service department and they reach some conclusion after the investigation is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7334)|
| 2:02:21| They may refer some of it to the, to the internal affairs division and then it comes back and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7341)|
| 2:02:27| some determination is made after that. Okay, so if there's an internal affairs investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7347)|
| 2:02:33| that's done at the conclusion, does that come back to law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7353)|
| 2:02:39| It will come back to law for, to assist with the evaluation. After they've made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7359)|
| 2:02:44| they've completed the investigation and they've made a recommendation, a conclusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7364)|
| 2:02:47| then it comes back to law, just for review. It'll come back to law, but then after it comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7367)|
| 2:02:53| back to law and civil service, then it goes to the appropriate disciplining authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7373)|
| 2:02:59| to move forward with the appropriate civil service discipline. If it's found that there was, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7379)|
| 2:03:08| okay, they concluded that the allegation was true or there was merit to that allegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7388)|
| 2:03:16| then it would, otherwise it would just be closed and law would just review it. It's a closed case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7396)|
| 2:03:21| Okay, thank you. Council Member Singh and then Council Member Testerman. Thank you. Chief Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7401)|
| 2:03:28| I've got a few questions since this, I mean, what we're talking about is what's going on with KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7408)|
| 2:03:33| and what's been reported. There are some officers that have said and done some awful things. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7413)|
| 2:03:41| not going to go into all the details, but there's some officers that have barely given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7421)|
| 2:03:45| the entire department a very bad name. That's a problem. Where do you think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7425)|
| 2:03:52| that this is stuck, that we're not able to get rid of the officers that need to be gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7432)|
| 2:04:00| So I would like to know which case you're referring to because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7440)|
| 2:04:04| the officer in the case that was investigated resigned while he was under investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7444)|
| 2:04:09| So that officer is gone. We did not even get to complete that investigation on that officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7449)|
| 2:04:15| because he resigned. I guess I'm wanting more clarification on your question as far as what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7455)|
| 2:04:23| reported in the paper. We've not had anyone come forward. I don't know if that's a former officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7463)|
| 2:04:28| or those are former officers or they're current officers. The current officers I've spoken to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7468)|
| 2:04:34| have not told me of any problems. Somebody's got to come forward for me to investigate it. I try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7474)|
| 2:04:42| and get on a very personal level with all of my officers, especially my minority officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7482)|
| 2:04:50| because I don't want them to feel uncomfortable. I really don't have an answer for you because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7490)|
| 2:04:56| wish I knew who came forward or what they said. I'm finding this conversation really frustrating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7496)|
| 2:05:02| because I cannot sit down and tell you this case and then this case and then this case. I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7502)|
| 2:05:06| all know that there have been general complaints and a lot of them. So I'm asking the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7506)|
| 2:05:11| very generally. You're asking what? The question very generally, where is it getting stuck that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7511)|
| 2:05:19| officers that we obviously have would not be keeping everybody safe, right? This is where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7519)|
| 2:05:25| it boils down. That those officers, if I am racist and sexist and hate women, I'm not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7525)|
| 2:05:32| to keep women. I'm not going to be as worried about their public safety. So that's what I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7532)|
| 2:05:38| saying. If there are officers that need to not be officers, where is the process getting stuck in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7538)|
| 2:05:44| trying to get them out and keep the force be something that we will respect? So your first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7544)|
| 2:05:50| question was if there are officers. We have to find those officers. I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7550)|
| 2:05:57| Yeah, Council Member Singh, I would just say that, you know, these allegations that we've heard about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7557)|
| 2:06:02| and have investigated raise some serious issues. One of the things that we've identified is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7562)|
| 2:06:07| we need to train our supervisory staff more effectively and also make sure that everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7567)|
| 2:06:13| is aware of the policies we have for how to report things, whether it's to civil service or law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7573)|
| 2:06:18| or to internal affairs, to know that they can report it, that they're encouraged to report it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7578)|
| 2:06:24| and, you know, how to do that and to make sure that they feel comfortable doing so. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7584)|
| 2:06:31| it's also, if you all approve this motion, we have 120 days to study this and get back to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7591)|
| 2:06:38| with more of these answers that I can, because I can understand your frustration and we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7598)|
| 2:06:42| have all the answers tonight, but I think with, you know, Council's support and with Dr. Drummond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7602)|
| 2:06:48| and Chief Thomas and our other directors and chiefs and, you know, we're going to examine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7608)|
| 2:06:55| this and bring a report back to you within 120 days. I do support Councilwoman Bugate's resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7615)|
| 2:07:05| but what I don't want to happen is for us to go through the process and then we find out that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7625)|
| 2:07:11| there's still no teeth in anything that we can do, any changes that we can make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7631)|
| 2:07:15| and that status quo remains. So in 120 days, I plan on having these really difficult conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7635)|
| 2:07:24| some more. Thank you. Councilmember Testerman? I was just going to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7644)|
| 2:07:32| Okay. Councilmember Testerman's called for the question. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7652)|
| 2:07:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7655)|
| 2:07:42| All those in favor of calling for the question, please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7662)|
| 2:07:48| Any opposed? Okay, the question's called. Now we're voting on the substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7668)|
| 2:07:53| that Ms. Fugate read to you a little, an hour ago, so there is no further questions or discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7673)|
| 2:08:00| All those in favor, please say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7680)|
| 2:08:11| Okay, no, it was not an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7691)|
| 2:08:16| There's a whole substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7696)|
| 2:08:22| Okay. Okay, so the motion carries unanimously. The substitute motion as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7702)|
| 2:08:28| read to you by Councilmember Fugate. Next item is 12A. 12A is an ordinance appropriating the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7708)|

| 2:08:48| Parker, do you have a question? I did not. Okay. It's my chair. Got it. Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7728)|
| 2:08:55| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries unanimously. Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7735)|
| 2:09:04| 12B is an ordinance appropriating the sum of $1,200 from the Parks and Recreation Department's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7744)|

| 2:09:26| Next is public forum. Greg Duthie signed up to speak. Mr. Duthie, if you could start by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7766)|
| 2:09:32| stating your name and address for the record, you'll have up to five minutes. Greg Duthie, 3825| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7772)|
| 2:09:38| Debonair. A couple quick things. I'm hoping in the future that we could add to the little thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7778)|
| 2:09:47| that's read at the beginning of every city council meeting that the disruptive noise that goes on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7787)|
| 2:09:56| outside also prevents all of us from hearing important things and hearing the rebuttals. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7796)|
| 2:10:04| maybe we could add that. It's very disruptive. I want to invite everybody again down to McGee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7804)|
| 2:10:12| and Blackstock. Those are two streets here under the bridge at 6 p.m. every Wednesday. For 22 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7812)|
| 2:10:20| the lost sheep ministry has been providing services to Knoxville's homeless. I'm glad to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7820)|
| 2:10:26| see that a lot of resolutions and things that have happened here in the last month have worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7826)|
| 2:10:32| towards helping our homeless population. I'm probably one of the people with lost sheep that knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7832)|
| 2:10:40| the 100 plus people by name. Not all of them, but many of them. One of the things I've noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7840)|
| 2:10:46| since the pandemic is the plethora of tents that have been down there. That was very little and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7846)|
| 2:10:55| never the case before. In fact, we have been doing research that we'll submit to the city if it hasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7855)|
| 2:11:01| already been done on where these people are living that we're feeding. The majority of them, where do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7861)|
| 2:11:08| you think? Tents. Second is outside, not in a tent. There are a few that are living in cars and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7868)|
| 2:11:15| warehouses and a few that are crashing in people's apartments or homes or have a roof over their head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7875)|
| 2:11:23| like Karm. So that's 6 p.m. We actually start at 6 30. I've asked a few city council people to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7883)|
| 2:11:32| down. I'm inviting all of you. You can just show up. You can observe. You can give a prayer. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7892)|
| 2:11:39| can do many things that like serve food or serve clothing. We'd love to see a presence down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7899)|
| 2:11:46| a diverse presence. So I'm inviting you down there. Also, the pandemic put a damper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7906)|
| 2:11:54| My voice is usually louder than moist, so I can out shout people out there that are disruptive. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7914)|
| 2:12:00| the historic African-American cemeteries that the city has worked very hard with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7920)|
| 2:12:06| particularly Mr. Brace and others, pandemic kind of shut us down and we're trying to revitalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7926)|
| 2:12:13| and get that going again. An email has been set up. I provided it another time, and it's basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7933)|
| 2:12:20| pretty simple. Knox Cemetery with an E-R-Y, Knox Cemetery Rehab at hotmail.com. So we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7940)|
| 2:12:30| for people from a diverse background to help improve this forgotten place off of Keith Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7950)|
| 2:12:39| consisting of three cemeteries and probably 10,000 plus African-Americans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7959)|
| 2:12:45| I wanted to thank Councilwoman Ryder and Councilwoman Singh. Today, I brought a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7965)|
| 2:12:53| to Councilwoman Singh's attention that was happening in Councilwoman Ryder's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7973)|
| 2:13:01| Both of them, I just love when council people work together, even when things aren't in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7981)|
| 2:13:06| district, because you care about the city. And I'm confident that Ms. Ryder can handle that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7986)|
| 2:13:14| rather than bring it to the attention of what it was. I'm just acknowledging we have some good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7994)|
| 2:13:18| people. So thank you, Lauren and Ms. Singh for that. And finally, I want to compliment a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=7998)|
| 2:13:25| employee in codes. Usually people don't like codes. I don't like codes when they're on me for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=8005)|
| 2:13:32| something. But Beth Goodman has really been working hard on an issue that's in, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=8012)|
| 2:13:40| Councilperson Thomas's district, or maybe Councilwoman Singh's district. I'm not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=8020)|
| 2:13:46| to say what it is, but it's basically some major codes violations. I, because I'm everywhere in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=8026)|
| 2:13:53| the city and care about the entire city, saw the need for that. And rather than bother the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=8033)|
| 2:14:01| individuals, I worked with Beth. And this is an ongoing thing. So I want her to make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=8041)|
| 2:14:06| Mayor, that you compliment her and let her know that I personally and others in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=8046)|
| 2:14:12| really appreciate what she does. That's all I had. Last time I wasn't able to be here, I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=8052)|
| 2:14:19| kind of disappointed in that. But thank you, all of you, for what you do for our city. It's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=8059)|
| 2:14:25| easy, as we can hear, when people disagree. It's not easy to do what you do and be everywhere. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=8065)|
| 2:14:32| there are people like me that have my eyes and ears going and truly care about this city. Thanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=8072)|
| 2:14:38| for the time. Thank you. Council, that concludes public forum. And without objection, this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=8078)|
| 2:14:44| is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210727?start=8084)|
