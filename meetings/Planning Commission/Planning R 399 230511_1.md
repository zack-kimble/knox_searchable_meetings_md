| 2:40:46| And this is a question, again, for looking at KGIS, and this picture was sometime in 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9646)|
| 2:40:53| You can see pretty significant grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9653)|
| 2:40:57| I can't tell from this, but when you all looked at this, one, was there, were they allowed to grade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9657)|
| 2:41:03| And then is the silt fence installed correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9663)|
| 2:41:06| Because it looks like it's only, if I'm looking at it, it looks like it's only on part of the property, not the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9666)|
| 2:41:11| So did they meet all the qualifications for that grading of what they might have done there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9671)|
| 2:41:16| I've not been out there myself, but my staff has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9676)|
| 2:41:20| I believe there was some placement of feel in the floodplain that we made them remove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9680)|
| 2:41:26| You can't really see from the picture there, but there is an area where they did feel to build the structure that's under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9686)|
| 2:41:34| But I'm pretty sure we made them remove all of that feel from what was in the floodplain there and install erosion controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9694)|
| 2:41:42| They were dumping dirt as of yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9702)|
| 2:41:46| I would just comment to the opposition that if this is rezoned and it's not being used in compliance with the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9706)|
| 2:41:56| these are typically complaint driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9716)|
| 2:41:59| And so I would certainly call Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9719)|
| 2:42:03| And it looks like they've already taken action on one case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9723)|
| 2:42:07| Applicant, are you ready to proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9727)|
| 2:42:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9733)|
| 2:42:14| I mean, what I would say is the applicant just wants to run their office there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9734)|
| 2:42:21| And occasionally I think that they will have the trucks that come by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9741)|
| 2:42:25| But it is my understanding that they will not be parking them there overnight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9745)|
| 2:42:29| as they have another facility that is their concrete facility where they actually crush concrete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9749)|
| 2:42:36| and store their sand and whatnot for the actual running of their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9756)|
| 2:42:40| And that that's the primary storage location for their trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9760)|
| 2:42:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9764)|
| 2:42:45| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9765)|
| 2:42:48| I'd like to make a motion we approve the OB zoning for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9768)|
| 2:42:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9772)|
| 2:42:53| We've got a motion by Vice Chair Uten, seconded by Commissioner Phillips to approve for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9773)|
| 2:42:59| Seeing no lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9779)|
| 2:43:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9781)|
| 2:43:02| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9782)|
| 2:43:03| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9783)|
| 2:43:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9784)|
| 2:43:14| I have just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9794)|
| 2:43:16| This is for my own learning because I think this is the first time that we've actually had a case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9796)|
| 2:43:23| where the applicant had an active citation that became knowledgeable to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9803)|
| 2:43:30| Is there anything that prevents someone, if they have active citations on one property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9810)|
| 2:43:36| from coming to work on another property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9816)|
| 2:43:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9819)|
| 2:43:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9823)|
| 2:43:44| We're moving to agenda item 24, Ron Worley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9824)|
| 2:43:47| Location, west side of Brownview Road, 8.3 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9827)|
| 2:43:52| Present zoning is agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9832)|
| 2:43:54| Zoning requested, low density residential, RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9834)|
| 2:43:57| Existing land use, agricultural forestry, vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9837)|
| 2:44:00| Staff recommendation, approve the planned residential zone with up to two dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9840)|
| 2:44:07| for the portion of the property shown in Exhibit B because it is consistent with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9847)|
| 2:44:12| and surrounding development, subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9852)|
| 2:44:15| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9855)|
| 2:44:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9856)|
| 2:44:18| Scott Williams, 4530 Annalee Way, Knoxville, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9858)|
| 2:44:22| I'm here on behalf of Ron Worley and I'm an engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9862)|
| 2:44:26| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9866)|
| 2:44:27| Do we have opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9867)|
| 2:44:30| Seeing no opposition, please proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9870)|
| 2:44:33| So we requested RA zoning for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9873)|
| 2:44:38| We're looking at doing some residential lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9878)|
| 2:44:40| You'll see an existing Brownview Road coming on the right side of the property identified there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9880)|
| 2:44:47| and the client's looking to subdivide off of that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9887)|
| 2:44:52| and essentially just develop the opposite side of the road from the houses that are already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9892)|
| 2:44:56| This is an older neighborhood and we're looking to do similar size lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9896)|
| 2:45:02| So we wanted a similar zoning as RA as what's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9902)|
| 2:45:07| The staff rec, actually those show is agricultural, but they're pretty much built similar to RA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9907)|
| 2:45:17| Somewhere in the ballpark, 75 feet wide and 10,000 to 20,000 square feet lot sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9917)|
| 2:45:26| So everything south of the cul-de-sac there, the turnaround,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9926)|
| 2:45:31| is just straight up the side of the mountain, the Beaver Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9931)|
| 2:45:34| So that's unusable and we agree with staff on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9934)|
| 2:45:37| We don't really want to do anything there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9937)|
| 2:45:39| But the portion down there in the flatter area that's along the road, we'd like to subdivide that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9939)|
| 2:45:46| They've recommended going to a PR zone with the ability to do somewhere around, I think, two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9946)|
| 2:45:55| And only on the four or so acres that they show that are not a part of the hillside, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9955)|
| 2:46:05| So that would only allow for, I think it was eight lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9965)|
| 2:46:12| Is that correct? I can't remember. I think it was eight lots total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9972)|
| 2:46:15| So we don't really think we're going to do much more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9975)|
| 2:46:19| I do think that in this case, the RA zone might be better fitting for that particular subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9979)|
| 2:46:25| It will demand that the client actually have more restrictive usage on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9985)|
| 2:46:30| They'll have to do 70 foot wide and 10,000 square foot lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9990)|
| 2:46:34| And we don't have a problem with the shaded area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9994)|
| 2:46:37| I think that's probably in the area that we'll be able to develop everything past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9997)|
| 2:46:43| That's just too steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10003)|
| 2:46:44| So we prefer the RA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10004)|
| 2:46:48| If we do go to PR, we would request that we would actually end up building probably more to try to offset the increased cost of going to the PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10008)|
| 2:46:57| We'd probably end up building 10 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10017)|
| 2:46:59| So I'd request 2.3 dwelling units per acre and probably do 60 foot wide lots if that were the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10019)|
| 2:47:06| But I would rather just go with the 70 footers and 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10026)|
| 2:47:10| I think it's reasonable for the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10030)|
| 2:47:18| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10038)|
| 2:47:25| Yeah, I'm okay with what the applicant is proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10045)|
| 2:47:31| This is, you know, if we were cutting in new roads and doing a bunch of new things and changing grades, I'd probably want another bite at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10051)|
| 2:47:37| But just cutting off normal lots on an existing county road, that RA, you know, on sewer, you're going to have a certain lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10057)|
| 2:47:46| I think it's 10,000 square feet on sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10066)|
| 2:47:49| And, you know, you'll probably end up with a better looking set of lots across the street than you would if you did the PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10069)|
| 2:47:58| Because the PR, like you said, you can do these really small, small, small lots there, which would not be in character with across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10078)|
| 2:48:06| So I'd make a motion we approve the RA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10086)|
| 2:48:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10090)|
| 2:48:12| We've got a motion from Vice Chair Uten, seconded by Commissioner Roth to approve for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10092)|
| 2:48:19| No, no, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10099)|
| 2:48:22| Go to RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10102)|
| 2:48:23| By the applicant's request, to approve for the applicant's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10103)|
| 2:48:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10108)|
| 2:48:29| Everybody clear on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10109)|
| 2:48:31| Ms. Porche.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10111)|
| 2:48:33| Yeah, I just wanted to also point out that the road, that Brownview Road is substandard in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10113)|
| 2:48:38| It's not striped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10118)|
| 2:48:39| It's only 14 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10119)|
| 2:48:40| And so it is the opinion of Engineering and Public Works that if they did exceed the number of lots that are currently allowed under the AG zone, that they would need to do road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10120)|
| 2:48:49| An 8.30 acres, one dwelling unit per acre, they'd be currently allowed to do eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10129)|
| 2:48:54| So staff's recommendation was trying to be in line with what they were currently allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10134)|
| 2:48:58| So I just wanted to make sure the applicant knew that if they do go to 10, there would be a likelihood of, you know, road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10138)|
| 2:49:04| And I'll defer to Engineering what that might include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10144)|
| 2:49:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10149)|
| 2:49:10| Mr. Elliott, do you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10150)|
| 2:49:12| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10152)|
| 2:49:14| We met with Mr. Worley on site and discussed with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10154)|
| 2:49:17| He currently, by right, could build eight houses now on the eight acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10157)|
| 2:49:20| So anything that exceeds those eight, we would want to discuss with him, maybe some road widening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10160)|
| 2:49:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10166)|
| 2:49:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10167)|
| 2:49:28| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10168)|
| 2:49:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10170)|
| 2:49:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10171)|
| 2:49:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10172)|
| 2:49:33| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10173)|
| 2:49:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10174)|
| 2:49:46| Mr. Bennett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10186)|
| 2:49:59| I'm going to skip it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10199)|
| 2:50:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10205)|
| 2:50:06| On to agenda item 28, subdivision Belltown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10206)|
| 2:50:09| Applicant and developer, Smithville Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10209)|
| 2:50:13| Location, north and south sides of West Emory Road, west of Rio Grande Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10213)|
| 2:50:18| Approximate acreage, 52.62 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10218)|
| 2:50:20| Zoning, planned development, and agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10220)|

| 2:50:43| And the staff recommendation, this will require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10243)|
| 2:50:46| First motion or recommendation is to approve the requested variances and alternative design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10246)|
| 2:50:52| based on the justification provided by the applicant and recommendations of Knox County Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10252)|

| 2:51:34| or sometime in the last six or seven months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10294)|

| 2:51:44| Can you remind me if for this phase one area, the land that is on this side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10304)|
| 2:51:53| if the mature trees that are there now, if those stay, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10313)|
| 2:52:00| Yeah, on the western border, you can see that's a blue line, so we won't be able to cross that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10320)|
| 2:52:06| All that vegetation will stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10326)|
| 2:52:08| Great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10328)|
| 2:52:10| Commissioner Schell, so this is a question for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10330)|
| 2:52:17| On the part, the row of, you know, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10337)|
| 2:52:24| They're not townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10344)|
| 2:52:26| Where the alley is along the power lines, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10346)|
| 2:52:30| so there's a sidewalk that runs all the way down in front of all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10350)|
| 2:52:35| And then it just ends at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10355)|
| 2:52:40| And on the master plan, like, just directly right of phase one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10360)|
| 2:52:46| that little area of land that there's nothing on there, right there, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10366)|
| 2:52:52| The master plan showed some sort of amenity of a, like, basketball, I don't know, tennis courts or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10372)|
| 2:52:58| Is that a future phase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10378)|
| 2:53:00| We'll be putting that in with this phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10380)|
| 2:53:02| It's pickleball, basketball, parking, and the milk kiosk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10382)|
| 2:53:05| so all that will be connected with sidewalks and parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10385)|
| 2:53:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10388)|

| 2:54:42| approximate size 1.15 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10482)|

| 2:55:08| We do have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10508)|
| 2:55:09| Would you like to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10509)|
| 2:55:11| I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10511)|
| 2:55:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10512)|
| 2:55:18| My name is Daniela Molodev.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10518)|
| 2:55:23| I'm the president of HUBZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10523)|
| 2:55:26| Ma'am, if you could, there is a button there that you could lower the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10526)|
| 2:55:29| Yeah, maybe I need it, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10529)|
| 2:55:37| If you'll restate your name, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10537)|
| 2:55:39| My name is Daniela Molodev.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10539)|
| 2:55:41| My address is 6750 Albatross Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10541)|
| 2:55:46| And I'm also the president of Hearthstone Homeowners Association on Albatross Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10546)|
| 2:55:53| I had another neighbor with me, but he had to leave, and a few others interested to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10553)|
| 2:55:57| But we all thought, you know, the meeting will be at 1.30, and most are busy with their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10557)|
| 2:56:05| So if you look on the map, this request for a storage yard will be just next to our subdivision in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10565)|
| 2:56:13| Most homeowners are very worried that this will devalue their properties and will also cause nuisance to our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10573)|
| 2:56:24| As you already know, we are very close to Shad Road, and most of us, you know, we think that we have enough, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10584)|
| 2:56:30| with Shad Road, with Creekside Food Truck Park, and with Smash Mouth Barbecue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10590)|
| 2:56:40| There are 11 comments left online, and all of them are against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10600)|
| 2:56:50| One of the neighbors, I think you know, the first neighbor that left a comment online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10610)|
| 2:56:56| she mentioned Chapter 12 from the noise ordinance, Section 1201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10616)|
| 2:57:03| Let me just read part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10623)|
| 2:57:05| The county commission finds that excessive noise is detrimental to the physical, mental, and social well-being of the citizens of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10625)|
| 2:57:14| as well as to their comfort, living conditions, general welfare, and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10634)|
| 2:57:20| So this noise issue is very, very important to our subdivision, and we are all very worried, you know, what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10640)|
| 2:57:30| If you approve this, equipment storage yard, you know, what's going to happen to all these, you know, homeowners living in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10650)|
| 2:57:40| Let me just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10660)|
| 2:57:44| Residents purchased along with their properties a right to quiet enjoyment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10664)|
| 2:57:49| This means they have a right to occupy their land without disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10669)|
| 2:57:53| Most homeowners in Hearthstone moved into their houses in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10673)|
| 2:57:58| To buy a house in 2020 and only enjoy it for three years before having a construction equipment storage yard disturb that right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10678)|
| 2:58:07| is a violation of 31 families' property right and their Fifth Amendment right to their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10687)|
| 2:58:13| So we're not asking you to do us a favor, you know, to deny this request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10693)|
| 2:58:19| but you also have to understand we all live in that subdivision, and the noise will affect our daily lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10699)|
| 2:58:27| You know, we need to sleep. We need to enjoy our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10707)|
| 2:58:30| I mean, this will take away that right, so we would...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10710)|
| 2:58:34| I mean, in the name of Hearthstone subdivision, we would like to ask, you know, to deny this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10714)|
| 2:58:41| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10721)|
| 2:58:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10722)|
| 2:58:48| Good afternoon. I'm Clay Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10728)|
| 2:58:50| I run a landscaping company, and my address is 8912 Strawflower Drive in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10730)|
| 2:58:57| We just hope to do what's being done for, I think, the last 10 years on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10737)|
| 2:59:04| It was previously owned and operated by Bayer Landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10744)|
| 2:59:08| They shuttered, I think, about four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10748)|
| 2:59:12| And then the last tenant was JK Aquatics and ran a garden center out of that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10752)|
| 2:59:19| They sold ponds, pond plants, boulders, had a garden center with a greenhouse and lots of other amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10759)|
| 2:59:27| In fact, I think that's what all the pictures are right now of when JK Aquatics was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10767)|
| 2:59:33| And so I come before you just really saying we're going to rent some repeat, doing kind of what was done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10773)|
| 2:59:41| And in terms of any noise or noise violations, we don't do any work at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10781)|
| 2:59:47| We're a landscaping company and we service locations all over Knoxville and the surrounding communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10787)|
| 2:59:54| And so we literally would store our landscape equipment there at night and then leave in the morning and go do our business everywhere else except there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10794)|
| 3:00:05| And so really that's the long and the short of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10805)|
| 3:00:08| I can answer any questions if you have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10808)|
| 3:00:13| Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10813)|
| 3:00:14| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10814)|
| 3:00:16| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10816)|
| 3:00:17| We're all meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10817)|
| 3:00:21| This facility does currently or would in the future store mulch, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10821)|
| 3:00:27| We don't currently store mulch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10827)|
| 3:00:29| That would be – so we moved from a third of an acre down off Sutherland Avenue and this is three times the size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10829)|
| 3:00:36| And so this would give us opportunity to store bulk materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10836)|
| 3:00:39| And so per staff's recommendation, that's why we're here today because there's not bulk storage there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10839)|
| 3:00:45| But we would like to buy in bulk, much like most medium to full-size landscaping companies do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10845)|
| 3:00:51| they'll buy a truckload at a time of river rock or mulch or pine straw or something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10851)|
| 3:00:56| and store it on facility until they need it and just kind of optimize scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10856)|
| 3:01:04| and essentially just buy a whole bunch of it and load it up in the morning and then take it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10864)|
| 3:01:09| So during agenda review, Commissioner Phillips brought up the comment about odor being generated from mulch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10869)|
| 3:01:17| Yeah, I heard about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10877)|
| 3:01:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10878)|
| 3:01:19| So is there some special solution that you have for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10879)|
| 3:01:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10883)|
| 3:01:25| I mean, mulch is dead wood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10885)|
| 3:01:29| I mean, but it's right across – I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10889)|
| 3:01:31| It's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10891)|
| 3:01:32| The property is adjoining to the municipal golf course, and so you've got that large piece of property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10892)|
| 3:01:38| But then there is that one cul-de-sac at the far back corner that the houses are visible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10898)|
| 3:01:44| but most of the actual adjoining neighbors have pretty good-sized yards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10904)|
| 3:01:50| that are 50 to 60 yards away from our perimeter fence there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10910)|
| 3:01:57| I don't think the two previous owners – well, they stored some mulch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10917)|
| 3:02:03| but they didn't sell mulch out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10923)|
| 3:02:05| They sold rock and pond and plant materials, but they sold plant materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10925)|
| 3:02:09| which is essentially algae sitting in a wading pool all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10929)|
| 3:02:13| So I don't know if there was any odor from that, but, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10933)|
| 3:02:16| it's nothing earth-shatteringly different than what was done in previous two businesses that were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10936)|
| 3:02:30| Mark? Michelle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10950)|
| 3:02:32| Oh, Whitney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10952)|
| 3:02:35| Was there a comment that they were going to store –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10955)|
| 3:02:38| the recommendation was that they were going to store the mulch away from the residents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10958)|
| 3:02:45| Yeah, if there's any consolation, it would – gosh, if I could drive the mouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10965)|
| 3:02:49| it would be kind of that – see that up towards the front of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10969)|
| 3:02:57| Well, I think I did designate kind of where we would do it in one of these attachments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10977)|
| 3:03:03| Yeah, right there, that attachment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10983)|
| 3:03:06| The storage bins would be kind of on the municipal golf course side of the property, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10986)|
| 3:03:16| and almost as far away from the cul-de-sac as we could get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=10996)|
| 3:03:20| In fact, can we make that – is that already a condition of the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11000)|
| 3:03:26| I guess it's per the site plan, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11006)|
| 3:03:29| Oh, gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11009)|
| 3:03:32| Yeah, and staff has reviewed with me the conditions around the site plan and the feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11012)|
| 3:03:36| and all the different things I would need to do and where we would need to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11016)|
| 3:03:41| So I'm in agreement with all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11021)|
| 3:03:44| Is the site plan binding where the storage goes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11024)|
| 3:03:50| Like you can't decide to move them to the back later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11030)|
| 3:03:58| I wouldn't want to, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11038)|
| 3:04:00| Logistically, it wouldn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11040)|
| 3:04:04| I'll just say that on use and reviews, development plan is part of the zoning as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11044)|
| 3:04:09| so if there was a large difference between how they operate versus what's shown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11049)|
| 3:04:15| then it could be a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11055)|
| 3:04:19| Also, I'll add, too, if it's a major concern, you could also make it a condition of the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11059)|
| 3:04:29| Pastor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11069)|
| 3:04:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11072)|
| 3:04:34| I think that the submittal of the site plan is a part of the staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11074)|
| 3:04:38| but to make sure we do belt and suspenders here, I will make a motion that we approve the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11078)|
| 3:04:45| for the storage yard subject to the five conditions that staff provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11085)|
| 3:04:50| as well as a SIS condition that binds the site plans that they submitted for the locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11090)|
| 3:04:55| of those outdoor bulk materials as a part of the conditions of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11095)|
| 3:05:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11100)|
| 3:05:02| Okay, so we've got a motion by Vice Chair Uten, seconded by Commissioner Schelso,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11102)|
| 3:05:07| to approve with one added condition that would bind the location of the outdoor storage of the bulk material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11107)|
| 3:05:18| Everybody clear on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11118)|
| 3:05:20| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11120)|
| 3:05:22| This is just a question for County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11122)|
| 3:05:25| I know this is kind of the last section of Shod Road to Shod Road that's still got to be widened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11125)|
| 3:05:31| but everything that they've proposed, it's enough setback that there's not any problems going forward, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11131)|
| 3:05:36| It is, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11136)|
| 3:05:38| We've actually purchased the right-of-way from this property, so we're set up to move forward with the road project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11138)|
| 3:05:44| Okay, having a motion and a second, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11144)|
| 3:05:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11148)|
| 3:05:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11149)|
| 3:05:50| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11150)|
| 3:05:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11151)|
| 3:05:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11152)|
| 3:06:02| Next agenda item is 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11162)|
| 3:06:05| Applicant, Sarah Berry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11165)|
| 3:06:07| Location, northwest side of Ike Lane at its western terminus, west of 1st Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11167)|
| 3:06:12| Approximate size of track, 10,312 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11172)|
| 3:06:16| Zoning, low-density residential RA, existing land use, single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11176)|
| 3:06:21| Proposed use, group daycare for a maximum of 15 children comprised of 12 preschool-aged children and three elementary school-aged children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11181)|
| 3:06:33| Staff recommendation is to approve the request for a group daycare home for no more than eight children subject to the noted four conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11193)|
| 3:06:43| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11203)|
| 3:06:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11205)|

| 3:06:49| Sarah Berry, 705 Ike Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11209)|
| 3:06:52| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11212)|
| 3:06:55| Seeing no opposition, if you'd like to proceed, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11215)|
| 3:06:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11217)|
| 3:06:58| Thank you to the Knox County Planning Committee for hearing my case, and to the planning staff for their recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11218)|
| 3:07:03| and to my neighbors who took the time to speak with me about my plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11223)|
| 3:07:07| I'm requesting for approval of my family's home as a use on review for a group home daycare with a capacity regularly kept at 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11227)|
| 3:07:15| with an additional three elementary school-aged children, if allowed by Tennessee Department of Human Services child care licensing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11235)|
| 3:07:22| while my family is not living in the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11242)|
| 3:07:24| While I see it as noted that in Article 2.2 in zoning, group child care homes are prohibited over 12, as noted in the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11244)|
| 3:07:33| I would ask the committee to consider the number 26 definition, which I've listed in my case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11253)|
| 3:07:38| of a group child care home used by Tennessee Department of Human Services licensing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11258)|
| 3:07:43| which also refers to 12 regularly used spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11263)|
| 3:07:46| but allows for the capacity to change if licensing approves an additional three elementary school-aged children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11266)|
| 3:07:53| which do not regularly use the spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11273)|
| 3:07:57| I would like my experience in child care and the growing community need to be considered when deciding to approve my request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11277)|
| 3:08:04| I have had a passion for working in child care since graduating high school from Union County High in 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11284)|
| 3:08:10| My very first summer out of high school, I began my child care career as a part-time nanny for my young cousins in West Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11290)|
| 3:08:17| and I often picked them up from Giving Tree Montessori, which is a Department of Education licensed center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11297)|
| 3:08:22| which still operates today out of a single family home in a neighborhood about three minutes from Rocky Hill Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11302)|
| 3:08:28| The next summer, while on break from East Tennessee State University,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11308)|
| 3:08:31| I began working at the Boys and Girls Club of Halls and Powell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11311)|
| 3:08:34| which is just down the street from where I'm proposing to operate my licensed group child care home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11314)|
| 3:08:39| From 2005 to 2012, I continued growing in the profession of early childhood development and education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11319)|
| 3:08:45| while working at Kinder Care in Johnson City, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11325)|
| 3:08:48| and finished my education at East Tennessee State, where I received my bachelor's in child psychology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11328)|
| 3:08:53| and my master's in experimental psychology, focusing on infant studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11333)|
| 3:08:57| In 2010, I came back to Knoxville for several months while working on my master's thesis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11337)|
| 3:09:02| and in 2010, sorry, and I nannied again for my newly adopted cousins who also went to Giving Tree Montessori.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11342)|
| 3:09:09| I also gained additional child care experience as a substitute for Starting Points Child Care in Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11349)|
| 3:09:16| which is a DHS licensed center that was converted from a single family home and rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11356)|
| 3:09:21| My family has moved multiple times and lived in both Richmond, Virginia, and San Diego, California,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11361)|
| 3:09:26| and I carried in my profession working for Kinder Care in Virginia in multiple center-based sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11366)|
| 3:09:31| and growing into a director of a site with 100 enrolled children and 13 staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11371)|
| 3:09:37| And when we moved to California, I began researching how to open a child care facility for the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11377)|
| 3:09:42| for my family's local church at the request of my pastor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11382)|
| 3:09:45| I ended up pursuing my own license to operate a family child care home for up to eight children in my home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11385)|
| 3:09:51| and I did give the pastor's granddaughter a discount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11391)|
| 3:09:54| I closed my child care home business for several weeks at a time in the summer and during winter breaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11394)|
| 3:09:59| so my family could travel back to Tennessee and Virginia to spend time with our family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11399)|
| 3:10:04| After almost two years of operation, I closed my family home child care business when the pandemic hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11404)|
| 3:10:10| However, I kept working as long as I could and was employed by a franchise owner and operator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11410)|
| 3:10:15| of a worldwide trilingual child care center to help the owner open her own center in the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11415)|
| 3:10:21| After a few months, I had to stop working because I have two young school-age children of my own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11421)|

| 3:10:30| My family moved back to Tennessee in summer 2020, and since then I began working as a site director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11430)|
| 3:10:36| for a DGS-licensed after-school program where I am still currently employed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11436)|
| 3:10:40| It's right across the street from one of my very first jobs and in an elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11440)|
| 3:10:44| for which the land was donated by a descendant of a first family of Tennessee for which I am also a descendant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11444)|
| 3:10:50| Although my family is moving a few hours away to Radford, Virginia for my husband's job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11450)|
| 3:10:55| I have strong ties to Knoxville, a family that loves to travel and for several weeks at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11455)|
| 3:11:00| multiple family places to reside in Tennessee while operating the group child care home license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11460)|
| 3:11:05| and I want to invest in my Tennessee home and community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11465)|
| 3:11:08| In my professional opinion as a child care provider and from what I hear from local North Knox families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11468)|
| 3:11:14| on a weekly basis when I answer inquiries about care, I believe that approving my use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11474)|
| 3:11:20| could serve the surrounding community well with a capacity of 12 regularly used spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11480)|
| 3:11:25| and an additional three elementary-age children if approved by licensing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11485)|
| 3:11:30| My greatest hope is that the Cedar Flats neighborhood and the surrounding community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11490)|
| 3:11:34| could utilize the care of my home and could provide, it could provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11494)|
| 3:11:39| which would maximize the space while minimizing traffic and that with 12 regularly offered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11499)|
| 3:11:45| child care spaces, I could have multiple employees, which better provides support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11505)|
| 3:11:49| for the children and staff and the home child care business as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11509)|
| 3:11:53| My hope is that the three additional elementary-age spaces, if approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11513)|
| 3:11:58| could be reserved for families of the Cedar Flats community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11518)|
| 3:12:01| or the families who already utilize the home for their younger children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11521)|
| 3:12:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11526)|
| 3:12:09| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11529)|
| 3:12:11| So I just want to make sure I'm looking at this correctly because I see what you requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11531)|
| 3:12:15| versus what staff's recommended is a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11535)|
| 3:12:18| But if I'm reading these correctly, DHS for 15 children requires 58 square feet of space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11538)|
| 3:12:25| not including halls, kitchens, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11545)|
| 3:12:29| And based on your criteria, you've got 58.46 at 15 kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11549)|
| 3:12:34| including the three additional school-age children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11554)|
| 3:12:37| But it looks like the county is recommending eight, which would almost double that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11557)|
| 3:12:45| So I'm just looking, I guess, for staff to kind of help me why we're doing something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11565)|
| 3:12:49| why our recommendations are a little more stringent than DHS here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11569)|
| 3:12:53| Ms. Hillman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11573)|
| 3:12:56| So the definition of a group daycare home in the zoning ordinance is to not exceed 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11576)|
| 3:13:02| and to have a minimum of eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11582)|
| 3:13:05| So that was the reference point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11585)|
| 3:13:08| So they would need a variance to exceed 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11588)|
| 3:13:13| So that's the county variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11593)|
| 3:13:15| There's no variance that says 12 underage with the additional three-age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11595)|
| 3:13:19| which is what the state law says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11599)|
| 3:13:21| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11601)|
| 3:13:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11602)|
| 3:13:23| Can I comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11603)|
| 3:13:25| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11605)|
| 3:13:27| So it says regular use when I saw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11607)|
| 3:13:30| When I met with Ms. Hillman, we didn't discuss that specific article, 2.2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11610)|
| 3:13:34| but when I read it, it says regularly used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11614)|
| 3:13:36| So that was why I asked for the allowance of the additional three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11616)|
| 3:13:40| because it does say regular use in the Tennessee Department of Human Services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11620)|
| 3:13:44| definition of group home childcare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11624)|
| 3:13:47| but that's why the additional three have to be approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11627)|
| 3:13:49| because they're not regularly used spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11629)|
| 3:13:53| Ms. Hillman, would you like to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11633)|
| 3:13:56| I would just defer to codes on their interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11636)|
| 3:14:00| I'm sorry, I was talking to Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11640)|
| 3:14:02| Repeat the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11642)|
| 3:14:04| My question boiled down to DHS regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11644)|
| 3:14:08| It says that there has to be 58 square feet of space per child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11648)|
| 3:14:13| She's a little over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11653)|
| 3:14:15| Does that allow her for the 12 regularly under school age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11655)|
| 3:14:19| with the variance of the three children who could be school age that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11659)|
| 3:14:23| as she just described, based on the code in DHS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11663)|
| 3:14:27| that it's not regular because they're not there all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11667)|
| 3:14:30| it's after school care?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11670)|
| 3:14:32| How would that conflict with any codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11672)|
| 3:14:35| Because it feels like right now the county is a little bit out of sync| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11675)|
| 3:14:39| with DHS in this one, so that's why I'm trying to understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11679)|
| 3:14:42| They are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11682)|
| 3:14:43| I don't believe we would look at the space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11683)|
| 3:14:45| other than from a building code perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11685)|
| 3:14:47| I guess the occupancy class would be determined by the number of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11687)|
| 3:14:52| she was going to have, which could kick into sprinkling requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11692)|
| 3:14:55| But I don't think we would have an issue that the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11695)|
| 3:14:59| actually says she can have between eight and 12 children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11699)|
| 3:15:03| The three that were part-time I don't think would count towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11703)|
| 3:15:06| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11706)|
| 3:15:10| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11710)|
| 3:15:11| So, you know, Mr. Chairman, with that, and I appreciate, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11711)|
| 3:15:15| Jesse for your work on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11715)|
| 3:15:17| but I'm going to go back and make a motion that we approve the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11717)|
| 3:15:20| request for a maximum of 12 regular children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11720)|
| 3:15:27| and up to three elementary school age children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11727)|
| 3:15:31| that would not be considered regular care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11731)|
| 3:15:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11735)|
| 3:15:38| Okay, so we've got a motion by Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11738)|
| 3:15:42| seconded by Commissioner Perez,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11742)|
| 3:15:46| based on the request of the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11746)|
| 3:15:49| which is eight to 12 occupancy with three elementary that are, I'll say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11749)|
| 3:15:58| irregular use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11758)|
| 3:16:02| Are we good with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11762)|
| 3:16:04| Okay, let's go on to some more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11764)|
| 3:16:07| That's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11767)|
| 3:16:09| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11769)|
| 3:16:13| My question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11773)|
| 3:16:14| So you're not going to be living in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11774)|
| 3:16:17| No, if I'm living in the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11777)|
| 3:16:19| I'm not required to have the use on review and I can seek the license on my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11779)|
| 3:16:23| own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11783)|
| 3:16:24| I'm coming to planning first into my neighborhood because I have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11784)|
| 3:16:27| intent to live in the home to start it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11787)|
| 3:16:30| hire people to help me run it and then run some of the operations from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11790)|
| 3:16:34| outside of the home and use the home solely as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11794)|
| 3:16:40| I guess my concern is just the parking for those employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11800)|
| 3:16:47| And then there's something to be said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11807)|
| 3:16:49| like I feel like a group day care home is a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11809)|
| 3:16:53| Someone lives there and they're more accountable to the neighbors that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11813)|
| 3:16:57| you know, are your neighbors that live next door to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11817)|
| 3:17:01| What feedback has the neighbors have a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11821)|
| 3:17:06| How do they feel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11826)|
| 3:17:07| They understand that you're not going to be living in this house and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11827)|
| 3:17:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11832)|
| 3:17:13| So I actually I'm currently employed and multiple of the neighbors that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11833)|
| 3:17:18| I've spoke with in person have been neighbors that are actually touching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11838)|
| 3:17:22| properties with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11842)|
| 3:17:24| The neighbors that I haven't spoke with that have put comments on most of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11844)|
| 3:17:27| which I saw this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11847)|
| 3:17:28| I don't know if it just didn't update or what happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11848)|
| 3:17:30| but the majority came in yesterday and most of those comments are from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11850)|
| 3:17:35| neighbors that I that didn't speak with me and don't actually touch the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11855)|
| 3:17:39| property that I'm on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11859)|
| 3:17:41| The neighbors that I've spoken with are neighbors that have not had any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11861)|
| 3:17:45| opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11865)|
| 3:17:46| I've made sure to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11866)|
| 3:17:48| And then again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11868)|
| 3:17:49| with me starting at living in the home and planning to be back quite often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11869)|
| 3:17:53| as I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11873)|
| 3:17:54| I am a long time Tennessee resident and my family plans to travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11874)|
| 3:17:59| That was why we were so candid with the information we shared with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11879)|
| 3:18:02| which they very publicly shared and not all accurately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11882)|
| 3:18:05| Those were neighbors that aren't even in adjacent properties to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11885)|
| 3:18:09| Those are neighbors on cul-de-sacs that aren't even in my area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11889)|
| 3:18:12| So I would be happy to address their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11892)|
| 3:18:16| We do have space for parking in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11896)|
| 3:18:18| We're one of the few residences where you can't even see the parking from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11898)|
| 3:18:21| the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11901)|
| 3:18:22| And then the only two additional spaces that we would put in are on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11902)|
| 3:18:25| sidewalk area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11905)|
| 3:18:26| That's already got some pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11906)|
| 3:18:28| I don't believe it would be an eyesore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11908)|
| 3:18:30| And most of the parking pads that are already there are quite large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11910)|
| 3:18:33| compared to the one that I'm proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11913)|
| 3:18:37| So with me coming back quite often and actually spending time in the home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11917)|
| 3:18:41| during peak times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11921)|
| 3:18:43| I feel like I would still be very much a part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11923)|
| 3:18:46| So I thought there was not going to be a need for a parking pad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11926)|
| 3:18:51| Does that change if we go to 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11931)|
| 3:18:54| Yeah, the two parking pads would be needed if it went to 12 or 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11934)|
| 3:19:01| Yeah, I guess that's what gives me some hesitation in going to 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11941)|
| 3:19:07| is changing the aesthetic looks of the home by adding that parking pad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11947)|
| 3:19:12| Is there going to be any signage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11952)|
| 3:19:15| I wasn't planning on doing any signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11955)|
| 3:19:18| It's not something where I think it's in an area where it would need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11958)|
| 3:19:21| signage to draw in people or for people to know where it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11961)|
| 3:19:25| I plan to use mostly word of mouth type references for bringing people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11965)|
| 3:19:30| in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11970)|
| 3:19:31| And like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11971)|
| 3:19:32| I'm a strong member of the community currently in childcare and long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11972)|
| 3:19:36| term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11976)|
| 3:19:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11977)|
| 3:19:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11979)|
| 3:19:40| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11980)|
| 3:19:41| Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11981)|
| 3:19:43| I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11983)|
| 3:19:45| How staff sees it one way and code sees it another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11985)|
| 3:19:49| So the motion that was made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11989)|
| 3:19:52| does that comply with this county zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11992)|
| 3:19:55| The group daycare home says a residence license by the State Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11995)|
| 3:19:59| Human Services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=11999)|
| 3:20:00| which care protection supervision are regularly provided for at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12000)|
| 3:20:05| eight children, eight, but not more than 12 children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12005)|
| 3:20:09| I don't think I disagree with planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12009)|
| 3:20:13| The zoning ordinance would allow up to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12013)|
| 3:20:15| So I'm not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12015)|
| 3:20:16| I'm not disagreeing with the planning's recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12016)|
| 3:20:19| The other three are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12019)|
| 3:20:20| I guess she describes as irregular service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12020)|
| 3:20:25| but then we get into an issue of how do you monitor that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12025)|
| 3:20:29| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12029)|
| 3:20:30| it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12030)|
| 3:20:31| is it going to be that could end up being 12 every day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12031)|
| 3:20:34| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12034)|
| 3:20:35| who knows Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12035)|
| 3:20:36| Chairman to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12036)|
| 3:20:38| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12038)|
| 3:20:39| this is where DHS licensing comes in because what it says is not more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12039)|
| 3:20:44| than 12 children or 15 children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12044)|
| 3:20:47| If approved for three additional school agents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12047)|
| 3:20:49| that's the DHS code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12049)|
| 3:20:51| So when they submit everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12051)|
| 3:20:53| they have to go through yearly licensure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12053)|
| 3:20:55| They're going to inspect their records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12055)|
| 3:20:57| They're going to look at how many kids are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12057)|
| 3:20:58| The ages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12058)|
| 3:20:59| if they're breaking that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12059)|
| 3:21:00| they're going to get in trouble with DHS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12060)|
| 3:21:02| That's really where all of this falls for licensing purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12062)|
| 3:21:06| Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12066)|
| 3:21:07| but we're talking about zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12067)|
| 3:21:09| not DHS requirements at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12069)|
| 3:21:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12071)|
| 3:21:12| I just want to make sure we're in compliance with the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12072)|
| 3:21:15| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12075)|
| 3:21:17| I think Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12077)|
| 3:21:18| Elliott said he didn't count the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12078)|
| 3:21:20| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12080)|
| 3:21:21| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12081)|
| 3:21:23| Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12083)|
| 3:21:24| I was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12084)|
| 3:21:25| I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12085)|
| 3:21:26| I think Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12086)|
| 3:21:27| Elliott said he didn't count the three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12087)|
| 3:21:28| the elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12088)|
| 3:21:29| I think that the three that are after school care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12089)|
| 3:21:32| right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12092)|
| 3:21:33| That's what I don't think they would count towards the 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12093)|
| 3:21:36| That are full-time there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12096)|
| 3:21:38| Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12098)|
| 3:21:39| I think we're raised a good point here during the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12099)|
| 3:21:41| Are those three going to be full-time in the summer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12101)|
| 3:21:43| I think you can only have 12 full-time and three after school care would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12103)|
| 3:21:48| not count towards that 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12108)|
| 3:21:50| I think she could only have 12 full-time children there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12110)|
| 3:21:57| Summarize what you're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12117)|
| 3:21:58| Commissioner shell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12118)|
| 3:21:59| So to clarify with 12 plus maybe three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12119)|
| 3:22:05| compared to the staff recommendation of eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12125)|
| 3:22:09| there has to be parking added to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12129)|
| 3:22:12| as provided in the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12132)|
| 3:22:14| right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12134)|
| 3:22:15| So the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12135)|
| 3:22:16| the three that are provided in the site plan on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12136)|
| 3:22:19| at the rear of the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12139)|
| 3:22:21| if it was capped at eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12141)|
| 3:22:23| those would be sufficient with the off street parking requirements to get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12143)|
| 3:22:28| 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12148)|
| 3:22:29| There would need to be those two additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12149)|
| 3:22:33| And there's two spots are in the front on that site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12153)|
| 3:22:36| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12156)|
| 3:22:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12157)|
| 3:22:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12158)|
| 3:22:39| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12159)|
| 3:22:40| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12160)|
| 3:22:41| I just don't see this property as an appropriate place to put a parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12161)|
| 3:22:47| lot in the front of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12167)|
| 3:22:48| You're adding more traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12168)|
| 3:22:50| I think if we were going to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12170)|
| 3:22:52| I think the recommendation of eight is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12172)|
| 3:22:54| is on point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12174)|
| 3:22:56| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12176)|
| 3:22:57| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12177)|
| 3:22:58| I'm inclined not to support 12 at the end of a cul-de-sac residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12178)|
| 3:23:01| cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12181)|
| 3:23:05| Especially when it says it should be on the perimeter of a neighborhood on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12185)|
| 3:23:09| a RTR collector street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12189)|
| 3:23:11| We're at the end of a cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12191)|
| 3:23:13| And the only reason they're using it is because it's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12193)|
| 3:23:16| It's theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12196)|
| 3:23:19| I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12199)|
| 3:23:20| I don't think we're doing the neighbors in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12200)|
| 3:23:22| That's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12202)|
| 3:23:24| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12204)|
| 3:23:25| Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12205)|
| 3:23:26| And to commission yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12206)|
| 3:23:27| So his point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12207)|
| 3:23:28| can we zoom back in on that as the two pads that are already shown on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12208)|
| 3:23:30| there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12210)|
| 3:23:31| Are those existing out front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12211)|
| 3:23:33| Or are they drawn in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12213)|
| 3:23:34| No,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12214)|
| 3:23:35| they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12215)|
| 3:23:36| They're not existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12216)|
| 3:23:37| The pad in the back is existing and it has the three spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12217)|
| 3:23:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12219)|
| 3:23:40| Just the way the drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12220)|
| 3:23:41| Look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12221)|
| 3:23:42| look there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12222)|
| 3:23:43| They were already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12223)|
| 3:23:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12224)|
| 3:23:45| Those two patches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12225)|
| 3:23:46| I'm asking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12226)|
| 3:23:47| So those don't exist right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12227)|
| 3:23:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=12228)|
