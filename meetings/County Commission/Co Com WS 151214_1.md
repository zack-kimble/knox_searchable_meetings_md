| 2:57:03| everything that you've mentioned here, requires funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10623)|
| 2:57:07| The thing of it is if we have enough dollars we can throw at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10627)|
| 2:57:11| and we can probably get a cure for it or a solution to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10631)|
| 2:57:15| We have a situation on roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10635)|
| 2:57:16| We have a situation, I guess, in funding our new health facilities or whatever we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10636)|
| 2:57:26| It all has to do around raising money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10646)|
| 2:57:29| The big issue here is make sure that our roads are good to where we can draw in development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10649)|
| 2:57:35| The second thing is to have the money that comes back from the state in equitable form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10655)|
| 2:57:40| We have a problem with BEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10660)|
| 2:57:42| We have a problem with road funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10662)|
| 2:57:44| I don't think we get our fair share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10664)|
| 2:57:46| We just need to say don't do any unfunded mandates that we have to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10666)|
| 2:57:53| When a governor says he's going to do 4% in education for pay raises and you don't get 4%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10673)|
| 2:57:59| we ought to hold our feet to the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10679)|
| 2:58:02| We also should say, okay, they've got BEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10682)|
| 2:58:05| Why don't we have the BEP working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10685)|
| 2:58:07| They say there's a problem in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10687)|
| 2:58:09| There's a problem in the formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10689)|
| 2:58:11| Why don't they fix it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10691)|
| 2:58:13| Let's make sure the funding is coming back so we can handle these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10693)|
| 2:58:17| And that would be my issue is make sure that the funds that go there comes back to us in an equitable form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10697)|
| 2:58:24| When you say BEP, the Board of Education is carrying BEP, so we'll be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10704)|
| 2:58:30| I know, but that's just an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10710)|
| 2:58:32| Like on roads, we should have, what did you say, $6 million in the queue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10712)|
| 2:58:38| $6 billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10718)|
| 2:58:39| $6 billion in the queue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10719)|
| 2:58:40| The state does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10720)|
| 2:58:41| The state does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10721)|
| 2:58:42| But, you know, what can we do to make that get here to where we can draw in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10722)|
| 2:58:48| One of the reasons we draw in people to build here and to get their factories here is because we've got a good road system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10728)|
| 2:58:56| We've just got to get other things, the funding to the right place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10736)|
| 2:59:00| but we've got to get it back from the state that takes money from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10740)|
| 2:59:03| And we've got to figure out a way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10743)|
| 2:59:05| Let's fix the BEP to make sure you get it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10745)|
| 2:59:08| Let's make sure that they fix the road funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10748)|
| 2:59:10| Let's make sure that they fix the problems in our county that we can handle the drug problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10750)|
| 2:59:18| Let's make sure that they know what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10758)|
| 2:59:20| Instead of just talking about it, let's get the money back in the hands of the people that can make things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10760)|
| 2:59:25| And how to do that, that has to come from you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10765)|
| 2:59:29| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10769)|
| 2:59:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10771)|
| 2:59:32| I think all of these suggestions are good, and I would suggest that we all think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10772)|
| 2:59:36| And next Monday, have the two that you think are the most important, and let's see who gets it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10776)|
| 2:59:41| Meeting Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10781)|
| 2:59:42| Meeting Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10782)|
| 2:59:43| Yeah, we've got to do it right now, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10783)|
| 2:59:45| And we've got to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10785)|
| 2:59:46| Get it going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10786)|
| 2:59:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10787)|
| 2:59:48| There's one other thing, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10788)|
| 2:59:50| The BEP, of course, but they've got that, so you've got the roads, you've got the drugs, so what else is it going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10790)|
| 2:59:56| That would be a fine priority for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10796)|
| 2:59:59| The two that we have on my list are prescription drugs and roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10799)|
| 3:00:03| And the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10803)|
| 3:00:04| And that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10804)|
| 3:00:06| So one other thing that I would like for us to approach before we leave here tonight, at least think of a way to do it, is get some type of order or plan on lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10806)|
| 3:00:22| Because most of the disagreement tonight has been on who's lights on and who's lights off and who's next and who's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10822)|
| 3:00:28| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10828)|
| 3:00:31| I don't have my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10831)|
| 3:00:33| You're going to do it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10833)|
| 3:00:36| Either we go to an electronic system or hold up a card or something, because what we're doing, and Mr. Vice Chairman, maybe that's your role up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10836)|
| 3:00:45| to see whose light is next and you keep a list of who's doing it or maybe one of these fine ladies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10845)|
| 3:00:50| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10850)|
| 3:00:51| But someone needs to do that because that's chaos, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10851)|
| 3:00:56| We have a discussion item for next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10856)|
| 3:00:59| That is a discussion item for next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10859)|
| 3:01:02| The problem is going to be is no matter who looks at the lights, when three people turn their lights on at a time, it's difficult to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10862)|
| 3:01:12| Or if they speak without turning their light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10872)|
| 3:01:15| I think we will have a handle on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10875)|
| 3:01:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10877)|
| 3:01:20| We still are looking for Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10880)|
| 3:01:29| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10889)|
| 3:01:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10891)|
| 3:01:32| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10892)|
| 3:01:35| Your light's not on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10895)|
| 3:01:36| Leave your light on until you start talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10896)|
| 3:01:38| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10898)|
| 3:01:39| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10899)|
| 3:01:42| I don't know if many of you know this, but many years ago, I believe it was KUB or West Knox did not want to grow out west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10902)|
| 3:01:49| So the North City Utilities Board expanded eastward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10909)|
| 3:01:55| And since that time, we have been paying, well, the North City Utilities Board has been paying payment in lieu of taxes to the North City for property in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10915)|
| 3:02:07| It's probably a few million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10927)|
| 3:02:09| If you wanted to work towards a private act to get that changed, that might be something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10929)|
| 3:02:17| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10937)|
| 3:02:19| Yeah, that's actually an excellent point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10939)|
| 3:02:21| As I said, I used to be on board at KUB, and they fund a lot of their city operations out of what they're charging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10941)|
| 3:02:29| I mean the margin on the West Knox customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10949)|
| 3:02:33| But just a quick question for Bob, because as you were describing the safety city, I think you alluded to a word that I like, but I don't know if this is doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10953)|
| 3:02:44| I think you said continued funding for safety city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10964)|
| 3:02:48| Safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10968)|
| 3:02:49| The safety center, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10969)|
| 3:02:53| Would that be appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10973)|
| 3:02:56| I know they're talking about capital, but do you think the state would give us continual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10976)|
| 3:03:01| Okay, Brad, good, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10981)|
| 3:03:03| I'll be quiet and talk, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10983)|
| 3:03:04| I don't think the state can, and I don't think the county can either, continually say we're going to fund something for 10 years or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10984)|
| 3:03:12| I don't know that they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10992)|
| 3:03:14| But I think Commissioner Varney made a commitment when he closed Lakeshore to keep that funding in East Tennessee and our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=10994)|
| 3:03:22| And that could change the next administration, but I think that was the discussion that Commissioner Varney had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11002)|
| 3:03:29| To try to get more than one year capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11009)|
| 3:03:31| Well, every year that money is reoccurring, but he's committed to long-term outpatient care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11011)|
| 3:03:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11018)|
| 3:03:42| We're still rolling around with what are our two items, and I guess we've got a tiebreaker here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11022)|
| 3:03:48| Mr. Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11028)|
| 3:03:50| No, no tiebreaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11030)|
| 3:03:51| Just one to consider, and many of you know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11031)|
| 3:03:55| Some may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11035)|
| 3:03:59| One that I would have to talk about with the legislature is the fact that the state charges us a one and an eighth percent admin fee to process our sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11039)|
| 3:04:10| It's electronic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11050)|
| 3:04:12| It can't be that hard, and they're not very good at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11052)|
| 3:04:14| They're not very good at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11054)|
| 3:04:16| We have corrections all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11056)|
| 3:04:20| Just to show you how they're not very good at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11060)|
| 3:04:24| we're in a three-month phase of paying the city $1.2 million over three months because of errors in how they distribute the tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11064)|
| 3:04:36| And it's not only how they distribute it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11076)|
| 3:04:38| It's how businesses turn it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11078)|
| 3:04:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11080)|
| 3:04:41| And we get some of those too, so it's give and take, so it's not always bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11081)|
| 3:04:44| But my point is this, that the state charges us one and an eighth percent every month that we get that sent back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11084)|
| 3:04:53| They collect all nine and a quarter percent and then pay us back two and a quarter percent and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11093)|
| 3:04:59| oh, by the way, we're going to take this amount from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11099)|
| 3:05:02| And it's all computerized now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11102)|
| 3:05:06| It's not as you all did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11106)|
| 3:05:08| They just had a $750 million surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11108)|
| 3:05:12| I can help them get rid of some of that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11112)|
| 3:05:16| What are you doing for lunch on Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11116)|
| 3:05:18| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11118)|
| 3:05:19| What are you doing for lunch on Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11119)|
| 3:05:20| I will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11120)|
| 3:05:21| That's just a fair point, and I don't care to bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11121)|
| 3:05:24| For us, it's like maybe $1.5 million, but that's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11124)|
| 3:05:34| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11134)|
| 3:05:35| Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11135)|
| 3:05:39| How long have they charged that rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11139)|
| 3:05:41| and what would you think would be a reasonable number to request that it be lowered to or completely eliminated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11141)|
| 3:05:48| I think it's been charged that for quite some time, as long as I can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11148)|
| 3:05:52| Here's what I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11152)|
| 3:05:54| I'm a fair guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11154)|
| 3:05:57| I would ask them to stair-step it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11157)|
| 3:05:59| I mean, I don't want you to do away with it all at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11159)|
| 3:06:01| And I don't even think it should go to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11161)|
| 3:06:05| But if you could go from one and an eighth down to one, down to whatever number we want to settle on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11165)|
| 3:06:13| and whatever number they want to settle on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11173)|
| 3:06:15| I mean, I just think in this day and time, computerized records, it's not that hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11175)|
| 3:06:23| We pay, just so you all know, we have a consultant that we pay $50,000 a year to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11183)|
| 3:06:31| and his job is to go through sales tax and income tax records to find errors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11191)|
| 3:06:39| And if he finds $30,000 in a year, we pay him $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11199)|
| 3:06:44| If he finds $800,000 in a year, we pay him the $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11204)|
| 3:06:49| Do you know how many times in a year he's found less than $50,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11209)|
| 3:06:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11214)|
| 3:06:55| Never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11215)|
| 3:06:56| Never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11216)|
| 3:06:57| Never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11217)|
| 3:06:59| And I think his first year he was like $10 million, but that's been 10, 12, 14 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11219)|
| 3:07:06| But, I mean, every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11226)|
| 3:07:08| I mean, haul income tax was a big one that was found this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11228)|
| 3:07:11| That was a correction from previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11231)|
| 3:07:13| I'm not saying do away with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11233)|
| 3:07:14| Reduce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11234)|
| 3:07:15| I think it is a fair thing to request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11235)|
| 3:07:18| And, listen, that's more money not only for us, it's more money that would go to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11238)|
| 3:07:24| It's more money for the city of Knoxville, more money for the town of Farrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11244)|
| 3:07:28| Statewide, that's an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11248)|
| 3:07:33| It baffles me every month I get that sheet and I see the administration fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11253)|
| 3:07:38| For what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11258)|
| 3:07:40| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11260)|
| 3:07:42| Yes, just quickly I wanted to revisit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11262)|
| 3:07:45| Let's talk about the safety center, Commissioner Brown and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11265)|
| 3:07:49| It really was more about the maintaining it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11269)|
| 3:07:52| I feel confident we're going to build it, but my real concern is that we get a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11272)|
| 3:07:57| from the legislative body that they're going to fight to somehow get this supported on a long-term basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11277)|
| 3:08:09| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11289)|
| 3:08:10| Yes, I just wanted to add to the transportation issue that Commissioner Anders said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11290)|
| 3:08:15| I think what we also should incorporate, too, is that Tennessee continue to have the strategy of a pay-as-you-go state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11295)|
| 3:08:24| and that we do not get into bonded indebtedness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11304)|
| 3:08:27| The other thing is I think that we also need to oppose any kind of thing where TDOT would roll out toll roads in the counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11307)|
| 3:08:47| If anybody has an opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11327)|
| 3:08:49| They went down that with the orange route and I don't think it's coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11329)|
| 3:08:54| Let me give an opinion here for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11334)|
| 3:09:00| My opinion of the state legislature, they're not going to tackle anything on roads right now in this session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11340)|
| 3:09:09| because the election is coming up right after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11349)|
| 3:09:14| So for us to waste a 15-minute segment on getting road money and all they'll say is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11354)|
| 3:09:22| well, where's the money going to come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11362)|
| 3:09:24| Do you support a tax increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11364)|
| 3:09:27| Would probably lead us into something that might not be as productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11367)|
| 3:09:33| I really like the push on prescription drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11373)|
| 3:09:36| That's the one that came up first and that's the one that's still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11376)|
| 3:09:41| These errors and processing fees on collecting money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11381)|
| 3:09:46| now that seems to be something Chris has really come upon that may mean money to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11386)|
| 3:09:54| So maybe we're at prescription drugs and don't do away with the hall tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11394)|
| 3:10:00| and help us with this one and an eighth percent collection fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11400)|
| 3:10:06| Since you've got computers doing it anyway and you're doing a bad job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11406)|
| 3:10:15| Let me get Smith first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11415)|
| 3:10:18| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11418)|
| 3:10:19| I think what Chris is saying is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11419)|
| 3:10:22| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11422)|
| 3:10:23| But it's $1.5 million and we're $20, $30, $40, $50 million in the hole on road projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11423)|
| 3:10:29| I think our return on our investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11429)|
| 3:10:32| I really think they'll have a discussion about revenue, gas tax revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11432)|
| 3:10:38| I don't want to leave that on the table, but I think they'll have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11438)|
| 3:10:45| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11445)|
| 3:10:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11447)|
| 3:10:49| On the safety center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11449)|
| 3:10:50| are we far enough along in the development of a plan to actually submit a proposal to anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11450)|
| 3:10:56| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11456)|
| 3:10:57| I believe that it's been being worked on so long that they've got dollars attached to it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11457)|
| 3:11:02| It's going to be in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11462)|
| 3:11:04| That's Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11464)|
| 3:11:05| That's Commissioner Odom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11465)|
| 3:11:07| Yeah, they're fixing to pull the trigger on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11467)|
| 3:11:10| RFP's on the street and I think already been replied to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11470)|
| 3:11:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11473)|
| 3:11:15| It's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11475)|
| 3:11:16| The money's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11476)|
| 3:11:17| It's ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11477)|
| 3:11:19| Then I don't see any need to go to the state with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11479)|
| 3:11:22| He's talking about long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11482)|
| 3:11:23| Long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11483)|
| 3:11:24| They don't commit to long term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11484)|
| 3:11:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11485)|
| 3:11:26| They commit this year and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11486)|
| 3:11:32| Okay, how are we going to pick our two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11492)|
| 3:11:34| We've had discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11494)|
| 3:11:36| We're going to go back to this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11496)|
| 3:11:42| That's awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11502)|
| 3:11:47| I think the prescription drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11507)|
| 3:11:48| I think we can vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11508)|
| 3:11:49| I think prescription drugs is something, like you said, it's been here a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11509)|
| 3:11:52| Prescription drug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11512)|
| 3:11:54| Yeah, I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11514)|
| 3:11:55| Sorry, I didn't turn my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11515)|
| 3:11:56| Chairman, I would suggest we do Chris's suggestion and prescription drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11516)|
| 3:12:02| Other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11522)|
| 3:12:04| I mean, you know, I tend to agree with Brad in terms of I know there's an election year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11524)|
| 3:12:10| but I think the governor's pushing roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11530)|
| 3:12:12| I think they need to know that forget about the politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11532)|
| 3:12:16| I think roads are very, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11536)|
| 3:12:18| I'm a city guy, okay, so I'm the city commissioner, but the county's roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11538)|
| 3:12:25| there are some projects out there that need funding, and I think we need to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11545)|
| 3:12:29| I may say it again next year, but I think that's a little more pressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11549)|
| 3:12:37| Chris, you and I are going to talk to them about this collection stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11557)|
| 3:12:43| Commissioner Oynbee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11563)|
| 3:12:44| No, not Commissioner Oynbee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11564)|
| 3:12:46| Commissioner Anders, you're going to talk about roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11566)|
| 3:12:50| And Commissioner Thomas, you're going to talk about prescription drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11570)|
| 3:12:56| Now then, does anyone disagree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11576)|
| 3:12:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11579)|
| 3:13:02| Do we have any announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11582)|
| 3:13:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11584)|
| 3:13:07| Yes, we sure do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11587)|
| 3:13:09| You know, Ed and I from time to time go out every month to try to do a community meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11589)|
| 3:13:15| and in December we decided we would just go out in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11595)|
| 3:13:19| and do something that would be something that's good for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11599)|
| 3:13:22| and not try to get together and necessarily talk about the issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11602)|
| 3:13:25| although we will be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11605)|
| 3:13:27| We're going to be at Westtown at the entrance next to Charming Charlie's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11607)|
| 3:13:33| and we'll be ringing the bell for the Salvation Army.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11613)|
| 3:13:36| And then the last week, if you'll take notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11616)|
| 3:13:38| Salvation Army is below in the Red Kettle donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11618)|
| 3:13:43| So this is a very important time of the year for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11623)|
| 3:13:47| This is the money they use to fund programs all year long for people that are our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11627)|
| 3:13:55| So we really are trying to put a push on for tomorrow night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11635)|
| 3:13:58| to have a lot of people come by and donate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11638)|
| 3:14:01| We'd love to have anyone and everyone come by, if they'd like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11641)|
| 3:14:04| and ring a bell with us tomorrow night, 5 to 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11644)|
| 3:14:07| Westtown Mall entrance next to Charming Charlie's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11647)|
| 3:14:10| We'd love to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11650)|
| 3:14:12| It's kind of, if you're looking at the Cheesecake Factory, it's to the left of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11652)|
| 3:14:18| not to the right of it, but a little bit to the left of it, and we'll be back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11658)|
| 3:14:22| And hopefully we can raise more money than average to help the Salvation Army that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11662)|
| 3:14:28| Yes, on that note, I'm glad they're doing it, and I'm going to come out there and help you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11668)|
| 3:14:32| But I'm doing three days next week, so everybody come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11672)|
| 3:14:36| I'll be at Food City on Bearden, in the Bearden area, and then at Cheesecake Factory twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11676)|
| 3:14:42| Send us an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11682)|
| 3:14:43| So I'll send that out and pass it to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11683)|
| 3:14:46| But you all come on out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11686)|
| 3:14:47| We need to raise these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11687)|
| 3:14:48| They need these funds back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11688)|
| 3:14:50| Any other announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11690)|
| 3:14:51| If not, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11691)|
| 3:15:21| .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS151214?start=11721)|
