| 0:00:35| We've literally had these about three weeks and just used them a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=35)|
| 0:00:42| I'm calling to order this meeting of the representatives of the Knox County Mayor's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=42)|

| 0:02:14| All right, and I did hear from District 2, Courtney Durrett, and District 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=134)|
| 0:02:22| Kyle Ward, that they were not going to be able to make it this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=142)|
| 0:02:27| Just also for purposes of review, this is a meeting between the people recognized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=147)|
| 0:02:35| so there will not be any opportunity for public discussion or for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=155)|
| 0:02:41| So having said that, I'd like to introduce Kevin Partin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=161)|
| 0:02:44| He's our Senior Director of the Health Department, and turn it over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=164)|
| 0:02:52| Sound key to finish signing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=172)|
| 0:03:14| Kevin, while you're waiting to load, it would be extremely helpful to me if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| and Fitch & Associates, as you're referring to the report, if occasionally you'd throw in a page number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=199)|
| 0:03:27| so that we could keep up more accurately with where you are in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=207)|
| 0:03:47| All right, I think it's working now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| Kevin Partin, Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=230)|
| 0:03:52| This past January, this body approved a contract with Fitch & Associates to come to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=232)|
| 0:03:59| meet with numerous stakeholders, and provide us an overview of our current EMS service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=239)|
| 0:04:07| as well as give us some recommendations for the future of EMS in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| and the challenges that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| Mr. Todd Sheridan from Fitch & Associates is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| He will give a high-level overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| He has a slideshow presentation to discuss his report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| and then also answer any questions you might have regarding his report or the RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=262)|
| 0:04:27| as we go through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| Director Myers is from Procurement as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| and he would answer any questions about where we're at in the process and how that's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=272)|
| 0:04:38| So I don't want to speak out of turn with those regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=278)|
| 0:04:44| Mr. Sheridan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=284)|
| 0:04:50| Hi, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| Thank you all so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| So my name is Todd Sheridan, junior partner with Fitch & Associates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| I've had the pleasure to be here with you all for a few months now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| and have really, I will say for the team here that I've been working with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| they have been open arms, open book with everybody involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| Now about Fitch & Associates and our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| So we started back about the February timeframe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| We came in within our team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| We came on site, and we asked for a lot of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| almost 200 points data elements in process for us to be provided by the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| by the EMS contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| We asked for involvement from on site and speaking with different stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=325)|
| 0:05:28| from the EMS agencies to the fire departments to different ambulance companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| and include engagement with the hospital staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=332)|
| 0:05:35| because they became key to this report as we started to walk through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| Now, really at a high level as we started to work through our process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| the first thing that we noticed, there was some critical key findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=345)|
| 0:05:49| Now, our key findings were derived from all these different stakeholder meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| we had on site, various different virtual meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| and the information that was provided to us from either the 911 center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=355)|
| 0:05:59| or from your EMS contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| Now, all critical findings that we come to within systems are not always bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| I want to start there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| But as we start to walk through some of the challenges that we noticed here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| as you all have been in a contract with your current provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| American Medical Response, since 2013, really under the same agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| no new RFP process, you had 11 different amendments to that contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| to kind of update as you went along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| But as you were updating, then those updates became more frequent once COVID hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| And as you started to walk through the COVID timeframe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| your EMS contractor also started to have challenges with the current model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| What we noticed with your current model is that about 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| between the market changes that happened, CPI, wages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=405)|
| 0:06:50| the EMS contractor financially started to have challenges in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| Now, we're seeing that across the industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| This is not new to just NOx.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| This is something we're seeing because in the EMS world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| you kind of lived between, we'll call it the big box stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| the fast food restaurants from a salary structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| between a parity with the police department and fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| You lived in between those moments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| Well, all of a sudden, all those big box stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| and all those fast foods started raising their rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| and it became a challenge because EMS had to start raising rates as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| Cost of doing business increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| And even prior to COVID, we had seen a recent study that we did with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| Fitch & Associates that noticed CPI had outpaced over the last 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=450)|
| 0:07:35| by about 7% from actual cost versus revenues provided within the EMS realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=455)|
| 0:07:42| So one of your challenges in the first critical finding we had is just your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| market changed, and so the contract that you currently were under was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| going to be financially feasible going into an RFP process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| to obtain a bunch of bidders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| So we wanted to make sure that there was a fair process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| that there was a process and a procurement process that would make win-wins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| for both you all getting what you need to make sure you are able to service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| the community, as well as have a win-win for a provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| that's able to work here financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| Critical finding number two, response times do not allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| for equitable community response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| Now, you start thinking with it from an equity standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| The way the design of the contract that you were under was the entire county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| receives one response time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| As we go through this presentation today, what you will notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| a lot of your response happens in a finite area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| So what happens is your current contractor, by contract design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| only has to staff a certain portion of your county, which leaves the rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| communities with elongated response times because they don't have to cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=530)|
| 0:08:55| that to a different measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| So that inequity needed to be corrected as we started to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| And we'll walk through that here in a little bit to talk about what the times we found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=542)|
| 0:09:08| Now, one of the biggest pieces that we found is that the current hospital times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| or what we allude to as wall times, are excessive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| and will prevent any provider from being successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| And what I mean by that is currently your current EMS contractor sits about 6.6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=561)|
| 0:09:29| 6.7 units or 12-hour units a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| So I think 3 24-hour units worth of EMS providers just standing against the wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=572)|
| 0:09:39| waiting to hand over their patient once they get to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| They're there on about an excess of what we consider about 40 minutes on average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| than what a normal standard should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| And in your top four hospitals that are within your community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| which we'll talk about covers about 86% of your volume where they transport to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| are up in the higher 50 range, minutes on average,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| and up into the 90 minutes at the 90th percentile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| That's costing the EMS provider just over $4 million a year worth of providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| standing against the wall and not being able to respond within your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=612)|
| 0:10:18| Now, one of your other challenge points is with your current EMS contractor to date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| and the way the contract is designed, they provide you month-end reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| They provide you the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| They provide you their information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| The challenge point is if that contractor was to leave you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| and you were to bring another contractor in, then you're starting from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| Now, you do have your county dispatch, which does have a robust program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| So you will have their data, but then you still have to make connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| You still have to get your reports in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| That transparency and that oversight, irrespective of who you have as a provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=653)|
| 0:11:00| right now would leave if your current contractor left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| and you had to put somebody else in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| So we're saying from a medical direction oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| and from a software oversight and dashboard processes that you all own that software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| you all have a singular medical director to provide a system of controls for your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=675)|
| 0:11:24| And last but not least, and we'll talk about this more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| is your mission area requires significant resourcing of the EMS system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| You'll see here in a minute as we start walking through some of the mapping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| and talk about where the hotspots are within your communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| a lot of resources from EMS are being tied up in the mission area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| You have a lot of volume, a lot of transient volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| But that transient volume has also contributed to some of the other health care needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| within your community also affecting payer mixes as it relates to your EMS provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| And we're going to walk through that here as we walk through the next few slides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| for current situation and critical findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=720)|
| 0:12:08| Overall within your community, though, what we looked at was about five years' worth of data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| from 2018 to 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| We were able to get a pretty good picture of what happened both pre-COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| and what's going on to date and try to do some normalizing as we walk through what happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| as you went through COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| What I will say, though, for the community is your overall number of transports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| and your overall calls have been fairly flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| They haven't gone up 2%, 3%, 4%, 5% each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| They've actually been pretty flat on the growth scale when we say volumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| What we will say, however, though, is that you have a lot of what we consider deemed critical calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| meaning dispatched as paramedic and being transported as BLS or low acuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=768)|
| 0:12:55| And we'll talk more about that as we walk through system design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=775)|
| 0:13:03| Now, as I had mentioned before, that equity of response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| Now, I'm going to just stop for a minute and talk a little bit about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| and I'll touch more about this later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| But the original contract design was for your EMS contracted agency to respond 10 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=793)|
| 0:13:22| within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| During COVID, because of some of the challenges and some of the revenue wall times, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| that time had been increased to 17 minutes at the 90th percentile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=811)|
| 0:13:37| Now, you think, okay, that's a seven-minute increase in response time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=817)|
| 0:13:43| That gave a lot of value back to the EMS provider to be able to have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| elongated response time because decreased performance adds cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=827)|
| 0:13:54| So if you want to go from 17 to 10, there's more cost associated to staff for readiness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| If you want to go to 10 to 17, it's less readiness you have to staff for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| and you're covering more demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| We'll show that in the chart in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| But what this chart will show is in the Knoxville area, and before I go there, let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| You'll see about, as we go through the slide deck, there are about six different zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| and we'll call them city zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| These were derived from your EMS contractor's data, and so they bucket into six specific areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=860)|
| 0:14:27| So they may not specifically correlate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| but they are geofenced around into specific areas within your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=870)|
| 0:14:37| Now, what we'll talk about is Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| So in Knoxville, you will see in 2022 when they had a 17-minute response time at the 90th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=879)|
| 0:14:46| they were able to meet that time at a 16.9% is what your community experience was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| So from a raw performance, meaning not taking exemptions into a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| or any other reasons, your community in that area received 16.9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| so about 16 minutes and 50 seconds of a response in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=901)|
| 0:15:08| Now, what we learned is that's about 90% of the overall volume that happens in that one area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=908)|
| 0:15:15| The challenge point is once you start looking at Farragut, Powell, Corryton, you start to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| and you say, okay, well, were we getting that same 17 minutes in those areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=920)|
| 0:15:27| Well, no, because the resources to cover to a contract's perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| so from a contractual perspective, to meet that was really the core of the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| where the highest volume is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| In the fringe areas, in those rural communities, they would have elongated times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| In certain areas of greater than 20 minutes in pretty much every community except for Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=943)|
| 0:15:50| You even had upwards in Corryton of greater than 25 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| in Strawberry Plains area greater than 26 minutes at the 90th percentile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=954)|
| 0:16:00| So as we start to understand from a system design, this is where we have to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| how to make sure the center core, the high volume, the high density, the high risk areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| are managed appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| We've got to make sure the rural communities from a system design are taken care of as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=973)|
| 0:16:23| As we start talking about system design moving forward, we look at it from managing risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| And, of course, we understand risk is a big part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| Risk and cost all kind of go hand in hand in what we can put into systems and design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| First thing we have to understand is just simple heat map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| So when we looked at your system to understand where the volume, the concentration of volume is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| you will see right in the center of the city in that mission area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| you'll see is your highest density call activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| which, if I'm looking correctly, is about 3,500 calls a year in just that area alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1014)|
| 0:17:03| Now, on the right-hand side is what we call an urban rural risk matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| So what we do as Fitch and Associates is we look at your area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| and we look as a commensurate risk mapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| So instead of where a hotspot mapping concentrates to just a density area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| we look at it from a risk profile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| And what we say is if there's a singular call that happens within a one kilometer by one kilometer square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| if you have four calls that happen per month and 50% of the adjacent sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| we consider that a high risk area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| So it is deemed red on your map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| If you have green area, which we consider a lower density area, or rural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| that's where we have two calls that happen every quarter with 50% of its adjacent sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1065)|
| 0:17:51| And if you don't see anything, that's what we consider more of a wilderness or very low risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| because there's low call activity that happens in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| So what this does is help you normalize risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| It also helps you design response to those areas to manage risk collectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| when you start talking about creating equitable zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1088)|
| 0:18:20| So as we start talking about response time review, I had mentioned right off the bat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| that the original contract design was for 10 minutes at the 90th percentile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| and it was increased to 17 minutes at the 90th percentile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| because of the challenges that were going on in the market space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| What we've indicated is that at that same time, in speaking with your current EMS contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1117)|
| 0:18:43| financially they were losing about $3.4 million a year at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| Now, they've been losing money on this contract since about 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| and so financially they've continued in this contract even though they've had those financial losses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1134)|
| 0:19:00| The response time change that supported the system, we believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| helped gain about $4 million back into the system of not having to buy readiness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| as I mentioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| Now, that did come at a cost and an increase in response time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| However, it made the loss much more manageable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| Now, we also noticed in the rural communities, and let me back this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1162)|
| 0:19:28| we found out that there was a seven-minute response time forgiveness being also applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1168)|
| 0:19:35| if a paramedic was on a fire unit and the ambulance was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| So basically you would get an additional seven minutes for response time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| What was happening was across the community that was not being applied evenly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| because you would have maybe some of the county fire departments that would have a paramedic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| and they would mark up with dispatch every day that they would have a paramedic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| or maybe the city fire department would have a paramedic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| but they did not mark up with the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| So it was not being applied equally across your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| Now, as we start looking at that, because of that not being applied equally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1207)|
| 0:20:13| that creates a challenge, especially from a system design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| So as we start talking about system design moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| we talk about creating those equitable response zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| We also talk about removing that seven-minute forgiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| Compliance is compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| Whatever you decide as a policy group moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| as we will talk about with some of the options we provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| as a policy group moving that forward, the compliance should be compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| It shouldn't have some type of forgiveness, especially when it's not applied equally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| And last but not least, the system currently needs to be financially responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| meaning that it needs to be a win-win for both parties to make sure something's sustainable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| for your community going in through the next contract cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1257)|
| 0:21:03| Now, we worked with AMR to understand a little bit about their operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| And when we did, and I'm going to explain this map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| So it all comes clear here in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| But what we had to understand was how they were deploying resources into your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| And what we also wanted to understand was how, if they were deploying it for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| let's call it a 10-minute response time, how that was occurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| and what some of the impacts were, and then what some of those changes were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| when they went to 17 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| Page 21, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| Sorry, I don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| I'm using the computer, so I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| I can't look right at the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| As we start walking through this, though, the first thing that we have to understand is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| when we design systems, you design demand and performance based on three factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| How many resources that you need just to cover geography as it relates to your contract design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1310)|
| 0:21:58| So when you're covering the historical performance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| you need to understand how many resources you have to have deployed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| Then we look at how many calls you need by hour of day, day of week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| We take that over 52 weeks and we give it an average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| Then we look at how long those calls last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| Not every call is 60 minutes, so we can't just do one call an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| In your case, it's almost an hour and 20 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| So you have to apply basically an hour and 20 minutes to every call to make sure that you get the right distribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1344)|
| 0:22:32| On the map on the left-hand side is what we call a drive time map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| This is what AMR gave us that was their current deployment and vehicle move-ups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1356)|
| 0:22:44| So as you may know, they do street corner posting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| They move from one place to the other based on where the next potential call is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| And they have some designated posts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| Now, from those posts, we then took and applied that and said, okay, well, how much volume does each post capture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1375)|
| 0:23:04| And we use what's called a diminishing return model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| So what's the value add of each one of those resources to cover historical volume?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1387)|
| 0:23:14| So in this case, for their post number one, we looked at our map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| We put all the calls on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| We had our system design and say, okay, at a 10-minute drive time, which one of these posts would capture the most volume?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1400)|
| 0:23:27| So in this case, at Paper Mill and North Shore, at 10 minutes would capture about 40,000 of your total calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1407)|
| 0:23:34| That one truck is not going to run that, but that's what from that post could capture, which is 62% of your overall historical volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1414)|
| 0:23:44| Then if you look at your AMR second post, so you remove all those data elements, rerun the system again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| at Maynardsville Road and Brown Gap, you add about 7,100 more calls are captured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1429)|
| 0:23:58| And you add a value of about 11 more percent capture of historical volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| As you start having a diminishing return moment, you get that they need six units within the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1444)|
| 0:24:11| with the green drive times on the map, to cover 92% of your historical volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1451)|
| 0:24:17| So they'll need at least six trucks covering geography just to cover the contract at 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1457)|
| 0:24:25| And let's keep a hold of that number six because it's going to be important here in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| Now you'll see the two charts that you'll see at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| The first chart at the top that's all green is what we call staffing to demand analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1474)|
| 0:24:41| We're going to work from the bottom up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| So the green bars that you see are the demand by hour, by day of week, Sunday to Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1483)|
| 0:24:49| And that's a normalized demand for time on task for each one of those calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| And then we applied those six geographic units in the area chart in blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1493)|
| 0:24:59| The blue line is what we call our geo demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| That's where you need to have that minimum covered if you're going to meet contract compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1503)|
| 0:25:10| The top chart, the red line, is the current attempted to staff by your current EMS contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1510)|
| 0:25:18| That is what they're trying to staff every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| However, in speaking with your EMS contractor, they said they were about 65% staffed at the time of our study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1523)|
| 0:25:30| So we indiscriminately just took 35% right off the top for every hour they're staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| And as you will see, the bar charts turn yellow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| meaning they're unable to meet the contract performance based on the staffing challenges to meet that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1539)|
| 0:25:46| So that's where now we start to understand what happened at the staffing side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| and some of the other market challenges that happen within the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| Now let's advance forward just for a minute to deployment for 17 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| Same scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| We did that same marginal utility approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| But in this case, instead of needing six units, you only need two units to cover 17 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| So you have a value add back in the system, or you don't have to buy readiness of about four units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1569)|
| 0:26:16| So that value add now is either back into the staffing model, or you don't have to try to overstaff anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1576)|
| 0:26:24| If you look at that second chart again, the top chart is what they would be trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| But the second chart is only two geographic units instead of six in the area chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| And as you can see, the contractor should be able at 17 minutes to perform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| which is what we noted early on into the equitable chart that we started on our third slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1600)|
| 0:26:48| So as you can see, the contractor is able to perform at that 17 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1608)|
| 0:26:56| Now as we start talking about the wall times and some of the challenges that have happened within the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| I had made mention that 86% of all the calls cumulatively go to four different hospitals within Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1621)|
| 0:27:11| or Knox County, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| Within these, you will see on the left-hand side on average,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| the University of Tennessee Medical Center has 55 minutes, or greater than 55 minutes hospital turnaround time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1637)|
| 0:27:25| and at the 90th percentile is 88 minutes, or greater than 88 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1645)|
| 0:27:32| When we start talking about industry standards, we start looking at 20 minutes at the 90th percentile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| about 13 minutes on average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| So when you start looking at the wasted number of unit hours, we start trying to understand how that applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| So if you look at on average, 53 minutes is what we looked at across your hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1665)|
| 0:27:51| having an average wall time of 53 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| If you're going to be on average at 13 minutes, is what the norm would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| then you would have a wasted amount of about 40 minutes per transport against the wall at the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1679)|
| 0:28:07| meaning that 67% of their time per hour they're on the wall at the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| meaning if there's greater than 43,000 transports, there's almost 30,000 wasted unit hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| and if you look at 12-hour shifts, which count to 4380,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| or your total number of unit hours per 12-hour shift a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| that means 6.68 wasted 12-hour units were standing against the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1707)|
| 0:28:34| And the estimated unit hour cost for this system we did as Fitch & Associates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| was just over $140 per hour per truck that is in the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1719)|
| 0:28:46| meaning that just wasted standing against the wall was just over $4.1 million of just resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1726)|
| 0:28:53| standing there turning over patients to the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| and they were not able to respond within your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1736)|
| 0:29:11| So one of the last critical findings we also had was some of the impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| as we talked about some of the mission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| What we also learned was when we started talking about the finances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| and some of the challenges in the community also involves your payer mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| Payer mix is key, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| If you have current Medicare or Medicaid third-party insurance, your governmental payers are capped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| but the challenge point is where you normally get your funds and have more of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| I'll just call it your better payers, are in your commercial insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1777)|
| 0:29:44| Where you get your most challenged payers is actually your private pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| and then you do get some of your Medicare HMO, but, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| they are a less payer than Medicare and Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| If you look within your community and what we have seen, and we'll start at the bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| your Medicare has reduced over the last three years by 6%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| which is typically your guaranteed payer, and it's a consistent governmental payer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| and it goes up year over year based on CPI and what the government applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| There's been some increases also for sequestering or some increases for Medicare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| and a little bit of sequestering that's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| However, the payment for Medicare has been going up to try to compensate for some of the market challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| However, you had a large shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| Six percent of your payer mix has shifted away from Medicare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| and you've had a 3% increase in Medicare HMOs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| But your largest change, which is typically only about 1% of anything you charge payer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1837)|
| 0:30:43| 1% to 2% is your private pay, and that's gone up also 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| So your challenge point is your payer mix changed during that same time frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| giving you a challenge as it relates to the amount collected because of your population of folks being transported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1853)|
| 0:31:05| Now, those are some of the high-level parts, and we'll talk a little bit more at the end of other considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| I want to just touch on, since this is more of a high-level presentation today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| I didn't want to get down too much in the weeds, but we'll touch more on that at the end on some other considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| But those touch really the critical findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| Now, as we start talking about the pathway forward, I'm just going to give a little bit of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1881)|
| 0:31:26| So as Fitch and Associates, we came in and we worked with a team from here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1886)|
| 0:31:32| and as mentioned, we went around and we spoke to all the different stakeholders here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| After we had our preliminary recommendation and our draft findings, we then came back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| and we represented to that same group of folks, so the same fire department folks, dispatch, the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| stakeholders at the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| We came back and we presented really this same information to those stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1910)|
| 0:31:57| received secondary feedback to make sure that we were working back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| Collectively, though, with Fitch and Associates, we put in and we presented about 35 different options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1922)|
| 0:32:09| both operational options and financial options to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| The reason why we did that is because ultimately this becomes a policy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| Fitch and Associates is not here to give you a one-way path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| As a policymaker, as a group of the county, our goal was to give you options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1941)|
| 0:32:26| So as we started to walk through those options, what we looked at was various different models,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| which include still using your performance-based model today, purchasing unit hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| which is considered what's called an alliance model, and we also evaluated what the cost would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| for the fire department model to do that if they worked the same street corner posting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| and the same workings as your system does today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| We applied cost to each one of those models to understand what response time changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| if you wanted to go from 10, stay to 17, if you wanted to have a hybrid 10-20, 10-15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| We walked through all of those moments together with your staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| Our goal with that was to then say we have provided you options, how would you want to move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1982)|
| 0:33:08| We're going to talk about the model today that they have chosen to move forward within the RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| but there was a multitude of different options that were provided that they could pick from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| as we start talking about options moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| Now, following our review and putting together the options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| there was some discussion further on other means and looking at the RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| especially around dispatch and process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| Those dispatch and processes could either maintain costs within our model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| or they could increase costs just depending on what's chosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| However, again, those lead into local policy decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| Now, like I had mentioned before, some of the limitations that you are still going to experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2025)|
| 0:33:52| and what I mean by that is irrespective of us presenting a model to you today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2032)|
| 0:33:58| right now your challenge is it relates to staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| A lot of the world still is, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| So if you're still 65% staffing and you adjust the model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| there's probably going to be a lead time and still some challenges that relates getting into the next model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| irrespective of the provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| There's still costs to complete the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| So as we start walking through, maybe a bidder will come in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| you know what, I want to give everybody a certain raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| and they add that into their costs that we aren't familiar with as a firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| The last piece is also your community makeup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| We're noticing that we're seeing a lot of areas doing revitalization projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| or we're starting to see a lot of urban sprawl within communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| So where communities are really honed in on, let's say, the core of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| starting to have that urban sprawl where you're starting to see more folks gravitate out into some of your communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| which my understanding in flying here today, there's a lot of construction going on in your northwest region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| So we can't predict those in the modeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| However, you have to be cognizant when you're designing an RFP how you can have still flexible to pilot new programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2097)|
| 0:35:04| to take care of that into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| Now, being within your community, just to make sure that we looked at various models,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| not just said we picked a number and went out of thin air to say it should be 10 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| or it should be 12 minutes or 17 minutes is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| What we need to do is ground that in some accrediting model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| We use the commission, in this case, use the commission of fire accreditation international model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| that looks at three specific parts of your response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| It looks at your alarm handling time, so in dispatch, which would not be your EMS contractor's responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| which turnout time, how long it takes them to muster and get wheels rolling, and also travel time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| Now, travel time, the commission of fire accreditation international looks at population against square miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| based on the area of response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| So trying to normalize the response to make sure you're managing relative risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| The first unit in these responses are really based around the medical first response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2157)|
| 0:36:02| The second unit is based around your transporting EMS resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2162)|
| 0:36:10| So we started to design moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| We started to look at, okay, what is that relative risk and what would that response time look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2172)|
| 0:36:18| So this chart helped us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| We started to look at those designated geographic areas to understand what is the response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2180)|
| 0:36:27| and all the volume happening in these specific communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| What's the specific square miles it covers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| Population in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| What is the population against square miles, which helps us understand if it's considered a suburban or rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2197)|
| 0:36:44| And then what the commission of fire accreditation does really well is they give you kind of a goal post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| It's called benchmarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| They call it the benchmark and baseline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| If you can get to the benchmark, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| If you can staff to it, you can deploy it, you can fund it, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| But there is a baseline that you should be at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| We looked at that for both the turnout time and mustering, which is 60 seconds to 90 seconds at the 90th percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| and then the benchmark time for travel time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| Now, you can see in each one of those at the end, if you looked at your Just Knoxville specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| you'd want to be between 9 minutes and 11 minutes and 54 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2237)|
| 0:37:23| That to be said, currently right now that area is at 17 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| If you were looking at all the other areas that were associated within our review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| you'll see that they're almost at 20 minutes at baseline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| and currently right now you're north of those 20 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| So as we started trying to understand how could you make an equitable response moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| what we looked at was in your communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| and we worked with your team here locally to determine what would be the right areas to divide for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2269)|
| 0:37:58| call it a suburban or urban response versus your rural responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2278)|
| 0:38:04| What we also determined was that in your core area in the red, what we're going to call the incorporated area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2284)|
| 0:38:12| that area is high and densely populated and should be considered in that 10-minute response time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2292)|
| 0:38:19| However, when we started looking at the county, the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| if you just wanted to look at it without dividing it east versus west as a response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2302)|
| 0:38:28| you could really shift all your resources just into the western side and not cover the eastern side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| So to make sure that both you had equitable response east versus west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| we looked at the historical volume and worked with your local leaders to help create the east versus west rural communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2317)|
| 0:38:44| to make sure now it forces resources, forces the contractor to cover your rural communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| and not just hone in solely into the incorporated areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| Because right now contract design allows them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| It doesn't force them into your rural communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| Sorry, I'm going to back up one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| I want to touch one more piece to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| What we also then looked at was your response times not only just for your life threatening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| but we also looked at your urgent and your low acuity calls as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| to understand what a response time would be for both those incorporated and east versus west rural communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2354)|
| 0:39:23| And what we wanted to do is we wanted to make sure that there was a prioritization that was put in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| so that let's say you're going to a lower acuity call and a higher acuity call comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| there's a mechanism for you to divert, let's say, from an abdominal pain to a cardiac arrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| We wanted to make sure that from a triaging perspective because in your dispatch center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| you do use a triaging tool that does help you identify your critical patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2382)|
| 0:39:51| Now, as we had mentioned earlier, we worked with about 35 different and reviewed about 35 different models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2391)|
| 0:39:57| In our review of those 35 different models, really bantered around between the county folks we were working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2397)|
| 0:40:04| They looked at the blended model to cover the city and also the rural communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2404)|
| 0:40:11| We looked at both a 10-minute and 20-minute, a 10-minute urban response, 20-minute rural response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2411)|
| 0:40:18| and we also looked at a 10-minute urban response and a 15-minute rural response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2418)|
| 0:40:24| Now, again, it's a local policy decision, but these were the two models that were ultimately looked at the hardest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2424)|
| 0:40:30| We wanted to show them today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| Now, as I had mentioned before, how many vehicles do you need to cover the geographic area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| So what we did was we looked at first how many units do you need to cover the urban area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| and then how many do you need to cover the rural areas separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| What we found is you would need four geographic units properly distributed to cover 10-minute urban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2445)|
| 0:40:53| 20-minute rural at the 90th percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| If you want to go to 10 minutes 15, it would take five units to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2457)|
| 0:41:03| So locally, from a policy decision, it was chosen from the RFP process to go through the 10-minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2463)|
| 0:41:09| to do the 10-20-minute model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2469)|
| 0:41:16| Now, that was just to cover the high-acuity calls, those priority one responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2476)|
| 0:41:22| What we also understood is the current EMS contractor, by design, except for here recently through COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2482)|
| 0:41:29| was trying to staff every resource as a paramedic, with a paramedic on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2489)|
| 0:41:35| And being dispatched, they were dispatched about 92% of the time needing a paramedic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2495)|
| 0:41:42| The challenge point is they were transporting 30% of the time with basic life support being provided to the patient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2502)|
| 0:41:50| meaning 30% of your patients had a paramedic EMT at a minimum responding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| when they could have used an EMT EMT resource, the most costly resource that you would have as a paramedic EMT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2516)|
| 0:42:03| However, they were also trying to respond in such a way that maybe was still using lights and sirens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2523)|
| 0:42:10| So what we wanted to do was add what was considered a tiered system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| So for your low acuity, adding into the contract the ability to use BLS units to cover these calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2534)|
| 0:42:22| which we believe takes four trucks 24-7 to capture those resources or that volume appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2542)|
| 0:42:32| That does not diminish taking away from your paramedics needing to be on your priority one calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| Last but not least, the state of Tennessee has worked to also adopt eight EMTs, advanced EMTs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2557)|
| 0:42:43| as being able to do life-threatening calls or doing the ALS calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2563)|
| 0:42:49| The challenge point is that's not the same level as paramedics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| So our recommendation at this point is that the EMTs, if they wanted to use a priority two response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| or be a part of the low acuity priority three, absolutely, but paramedic at a minimum for your life-threatening calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2578)|
| 0:43:08| So going back to understanding what a staffing demand would look like for an EMS contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2588)|
| 0:43:14| irrespective of who it is would need to staff this model, they'd be looking to do four units 24-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2594)|
| 0:43:21| And if I'm looking at it correctly, it's about 17 units at peak of day for ALS during your highest volume periods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2601)|
| 0:43:27| to be able to cover appropriately for your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| Now, your current EMS contractor right now by system design does not have to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2612)|
| 0:43:38| because they're only trying to meet a 17-minute response time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| So there would be an enhancement to the system on expected resourcing for this model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2621)|
| 0:43:50| Now, as we start talking about the system performance moving forward, whichever model you're choosing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| what we don't want to do is decrease customer experience or customer expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| So that's why as we started to walk through this, we looked at each one of those cities to make sure the rural communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2640)|
| 0:44:06| were being taken care of and also the city was not taking a step backwards either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2646)|
| 0:44:13| We do believe that a tiered response, ALS and BLS, should be considered in your next RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| Allow BLS units to run those priority three calls, keeping the paramedics ready for those high acuity calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2659)|
| 0:44:29| Again, eliminate that seven-minute extension with a paramedic on a fire truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2669)|
| 0:44:35| Provide that equitable coverage for your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| And then eliminate level zero fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| One of the parts that you have contracted for is a performance-based contract, not a staffing model contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2683)|
| 0:44:52| meaning you're not expecting them to have a certain staffing and then say, okay, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| because you didn't have that staffing, fining them because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| The challenge point is performance-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| You may be in a hospital and come out at a level zero and you still make the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| So the challenge point is you're either penalizing them on performance or you're penalizing them on staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2705)|
| 0:45:11| We believe if you're staying within a performance-based contract, you penalize them on performance and not just staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2711)|
| 0:45:19| Now, depending on the model chosen, and as we had mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| the county had chosen to move forward from a policy side as the 10-20 model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2723)|
| 0:45:29| We believe that there's a range of costs that were associated that would come back to the community here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2729)|
| 0:45:35| You've been fortunate enough to not have a cost imposed because of the community makeup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2735)|
| 0:45:41| because of the market space that you were in, but unfortunately about 2020, that shifted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2741)|
| 0:45:47| And we believe going into this contract, you could expect to spend about $1.9 to $3 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| to create that win-win situation for any provider to come in a performance-based model to operate within your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2752)|
| 0:46:01| Now, again, different performance standards adds different costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2761)|
| 0:46:06| If you wanted to go to the 10-15, there would be more costs because you would have to add another resource to cover that geographically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2766)|
| 0:46:13| Depending on how much you allow your provider to charge from a charge master,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| they may be able to collect a little more from third-party insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| So depending on how they bid it, they might get a little more revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2781)|
| 0:46:27| Depending on the dispatch model you chose, that could add cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2787)|
| 0:46:33| Last but not least, depending on the options, your provider that we don't know about could add cost to your system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2793)|
| 0:46:39| But our range is based on your current charge master and, again, adjusting a charge master to 300% Medicare allowable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2799)|
| 0:46:47| then we believe your cost would fall between $1.9 and $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2807)|
| 0:46:54| So coming to a conclusion here, we took all your other contract considerations that we saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2814)|
| 0:47:00| And, again, we didn't go into high depth in your current contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| but we wanted to touch on just a few pieces that we felt would be important to touch on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| There's more of these within the study and the document associated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| However, in working with the Knox County folks, your stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| listening to your community response folks, fire departments, hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| what we derived from that conversation is a bunch of different contract considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2842)|
| 0:47:28| First is we believe the county should hire its own medical director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| have its own clinical oversight to ensure everyone's being treated equally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2852)|
| 0:47:38| all the way from dispatch to medical first response to the EMS agency or EMS contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2858)|
| 0:47:44| That way that medical director is ensuring that the clinical care across your entire community is being handled equally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2864)|
| 0:47:53| You're looking at handling it from an EMS system and not just based around one provider within the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2873)|
| 0:48:01| The county should own and operate all of its operational and clinical performance metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| Part of the contract that we looked at was putting clinical performance standards based on what we call process outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2885)|
| 0:48:12| And those process outcomes are based around what we call code stroke, code heart, code trauma, code sepsis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2892)|
| 0:48:18| We look at the agency specific protocols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| That software, both operationally and clinically, should be owned by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| So irrespective if your contract is successful or maybe they're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| you own it so you can change out providers, or if you decide to take it in-house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2909)|
| 0:48:34| you already own the oversight software for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| Last but not least, when we used to do RFPs, we talked about RFPs needing to start with brand new vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2918)|
| 0:48:45| It limited your maintenance cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| Unfortunately, if anybody's going to buy a vehicle these days, that's not something you can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| and EMS is about 24 months of getting new vehicles if you try to order today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2932)|
| 0:48:58| So what we're saying is that in your contract, to try to control some of your costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| and some of the maintenance costs, no vehicle should be over seven years or over 300,000 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2941)|
| 0:49:08| Vendors should be required to have a mutual aid plan with all your surrounding jurisdictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2948)|
| 0:49:13| That way, if you have a surge in response, you have a dedicated backup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| and if you're a county, you have a reciprocation to your neighboring agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2957)|
| 0:49:24| Decedent transports, we heard loud and clear that was a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| So what we did as part of this contract, we worked with the county, we listened to the folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| and we believe that there should be a response time associated with your decedent transports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2975)|
| 0:49:40| That was not that way previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| So having a dedicated response time for decedent transports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2982)|
| 0:49:45| but allowing one person being dedicated to, if they so chose, to be able to do those decedent transports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2985)|
| 0:49:53| On one of the previous slides, I talked about the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| If you don't know, decedent transports take up about seven hours on average per day within your community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=2996)|
| 0:50:03| of just moving decedent transports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| So it's really, there's a lot of resourcing being done with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| We talked about mobile integrated health and community benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3010)|
| 0:50:14| The government has not started to fund programs such as people going and checking on folks at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3014)|
| 0:50:21| or trying to help reduce the frequent users within your system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3021)|
| 0:50:25| If that's something you so choose, which is a community benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| and you as a policy group choose that as a good pathway forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| or to continue with different dispatch protocols to navigate people through the system differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| those are added costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| However, those are policy choices if you think that's best for your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3039)|
| 0:50:46| Ensure that whoever the EMS agency comes in directly connects or works on the dispatch CAD that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3046)|
| 0:50:53| You have a very robust dispatch center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| You have the opportunity to keep an agency within the roof there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| I believe that should be continued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| And irrespective if they don't stay within the roof or they decide to use their own CAD software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| there needs to be a direct CAD to CAD interface that ensures you collect all the data in real time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3067)|
| 0:51:13| so you're not just reliant on somebody providing you data at the end of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3073)|
| 0:51:19| Hospital wall times are going to have to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| That is not only a financial impact but operational impact to whoever your future EMS contractor is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3082)|
| 0:51:31| That challenge point, holding six 12-hour trucks or three 24-hour trucks against the wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3091)|
| 0:51:38| is undoubtedly with somebody standing there with health care officials around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3098)|
| 0:51:44| unable to be able to drop those patients off to go into your community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| and get somebody that doesn't have a health care provider next to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| or to meet a performance standard is going to be a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| Fixing that is going to be a huge benefit for you in resourcing within your system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3115)|
| 0:52:02| Last but not least, the mission area that you have within your community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| being the transient population that you have, that's going to take a multifaceted health care approach to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3126)|
| 0:52:12| That's not just an EMS agency that's going to be able to do that solely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| That's going to be partnerships with the health department, with the hospitals to be able to address ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3136)|
| 0:52:22| because right now you're reliant on somebody calls 911, they go out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| and then of course EMS doesn't have a means to turn people away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| We have to transport if somebody says so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| So that's by the way the system is designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| So as you start moving forward, looking at those community benefit programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| partnering with hospitals, helping with ways within the health department to work on the mission area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3161)|
| 0:52:47| those are going to be key to the system's success as you move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3167)|
| 0:52:54| And with that, Kevin, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| Be glad to take any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| I'm sure there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| In your presentation, did you mention that in Knox County we have four hospitals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| No, I said the top four hospitals that are accumulating 86% of the overall time at the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3198)|
| 0:53:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| So the fifth hospital, who is not requiring a lot of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| They all are requiring a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| They are, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| So if you look at it just in general, and I'll look at just the top ones that we have on the slide here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| I'll go back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| You have University of Tennessee at on average 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| Then you have your regional medical center, 54, Park West, 54, North Knox, 57, Turkey Creek, 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3234)|
| 0:54:03| Your forensic lab is the lowest at 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| We did do that as a turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| And you can see the rest, they start hitting that diminishing return moment, but they're still going into the 50s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3247)|
| 0:54:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| Thank you, sir, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| I've got a follow-up question on the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| It seems like the hospital, they're understaffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| Nobody wants to work anymore, so they're understaffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| That's where the problem starts because instead of waiting 40 minutes or 50 minutes or an hour if it was staffed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3272)|
| 0:54:40| they could get back on in 13 minutes and we wouldn't see a lot of these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| And it's not the hospital's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| We just, you know, they're trying their best to do what they can do, but it starts there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| Did you check in to set the drop-offs from other county ambulance services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3292)|
| 0:54:59| I know at UT you go down Alcoa Highway, Union County, Anderson County, Sevier County, coming down Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3299)|
| 0:55:08| That's taking up time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| Did you check in to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| Make sure I understood your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| That we checked in to other counties and other hospitals and what their times were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| I just want to make sure I understood, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| Us being a metropolitan area with the trauma hospitals that we got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3320)|
| 0:55:26| surrounding counties are going to send them to UT or they're going to send them to, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3326)|
| 0:55:32| to know one of those out there or trauma, high trauma centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| They're sending there and that's taking away beds or taking away time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3337)|
| 0:55:43| Did you consider that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| So we did not consider that because that was not part of our, within the scope for us to look at the hospital times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| Now, I will say there was good engagement with the hospitals during our study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| and they understood some of the challenges both from what they're seeing in the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| also at some of the turnaround times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| Now, addressing those nationwide has been a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| Even above our own borders in Canada, we've been fortunate enough to work up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3363)|
| 0:56:09| and you can see some of the challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| This is not unique to Knoxville right now, but unfortunately people are handling it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| And so as you start getting engagement with the hospitals, as this starts coming to the forefront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3375)|
| 0:56:20| as we start working through some of the, as we're starting to see some of the quiet hiring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| as we heard in Becker's report the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| we're starting to see some of that turn within the hospitals, but it's a slow-moving process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| And the reason for us pointing that out is, again, irrespective of who your next EMS contractor is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3391)|
| 0:56:37| going into the RFP just being cognizant that that's not going to change overnight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| that you're going to continue having these system problems, irrespective of the provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| is just what we want to set as the understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| So the better you're able to help with the hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| the partnership you have with the health department and the hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| that's going to start freeing up for the EMS agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3414)|
| 0:56:57| Yeah, I agree with that, and that's a lot of the questions I get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| I've been getting requests, why don't we have a county-ran service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3420)|
| 0:57:08| And I tell them, if it was county or if it was private, we'd still have the same issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| because it's not, it's the labor issues, basically what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3432)|
| 0:57:17| So do you know, you just did Blount County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3437)|
| 0:57:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| And how's that working out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| Does that compare kind of what we're needing and what, I know they're a smaller county, but they're?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| So I'm actually in the process of doing their annual report right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| so that will be coming out here in the next couple weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| What I will tell you is, in their report, and, again, they just got their draft the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| but that's moving along pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| And so they've still got some pieces that they need to check off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| Their piece is much, much different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| Your geographic makeup, your density of populations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| the number of hospitals that you transport to is a much different makeup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| Your community makeup and your challenges, especially with the mission area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| that's creating and affording you a much different situation than they are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3481)|
| 0:58:06| Now, the situation's working for them, and you can, and I'm not going to go too much into that report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3486)|
| 0:58:11| because it's not public yet, but it is working for them, and they still have some growing pains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| but all in all, that's working for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3496)|
| 0:58:20| But you are a different makeup as it relates to a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| your challenges and needs compared to Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| I'd like to say we're the metropolitan county that they're going to send to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| Very interesting about the software and the EMS contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3514)|
| 0:58:41| Is there any surrounding close areas that already do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| I can understand the software for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| We need to be safe to where we own that software, and if something happens, we still control it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3528)|
| 0:58:55| And the coordinator, the EMS contractor, kind of interesting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3535)|
| 0:59:00| I'd like to know more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| What would be the advantage of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| Yeah, so a couple of advantages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| So think of it in this direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| Let's say you have Contractor A that you have today or Contractor B you might have tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| Let's say Contractor A is unable to perform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| They leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3559)|
| 0:59:20| You can bring Contractor B in, and the expectation for the system is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| The way you manage them is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| All the processes and reporting is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| So you don't have to go, well, I need to make this new report up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| I need you to produce this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| What ends up happening is you have all the controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| You have the expectation for your community and how they're cared for set up by the medical director who sets all the protocols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3576)|
| 0:59:42| So as a system, irrespective of who the provider is, it allows you to have that consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3582)|
| 0:59:49| So you either maybe one provider doesn't work and you want to change to another provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| or you want to turn it and make it a county-run system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| However you worked at, the system of controls are in place so that you're not losing that control every time you change a provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3597)|
| 1:00:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3609)|
| 1:00:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| When you worked at the hospital, did they offer any commentary, any solutions, any, I mean, or did they just say, tough, that's the way it's going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3612)|
| 1:00:26| I think it was an education back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| I'm not going to say right now that there was any offered solution with the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| Our lens was looking at where the challenges were and identifying those and bringing them to the forefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| We didn't walk through them, nor was our scope to help them with that side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| However, what I will say is no one ran from the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| Everyone was highly engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| But if nothing changes, you can have all the staffing in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| But if you don't have the support from the hospitals to figure out a different method,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| and maybe it's just staffing on their side, too, but it could be a different way of processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| It could be a different way of triaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| It could be a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| I mean, there's a hundred different ways to try to find a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| So on the staffing side with AMR, our current provider, is, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3665)|
| 1:01:14| was there any discussion from them about how to get better staffing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3674)|
| 1:01:21| Even if it's a challenge nationwide, you still have to manage your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| You do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| So I'll talk a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| So what I will tell you is when you're looking at the market space and where it's at today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| financially what has adjusted, I think we're doing a lot of learning as an EMS industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| You're starting to see places in Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| We're running a program down in Lubbock, Texas, because we actually not only with Fitch & Associates do consulting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| but we actually do and manage different programs across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| For the first time ever, we're starting to see salaries that are just outpacing just different providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| or fire departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| We're starting to see parity where we had not seen that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3714)|
| 1:01:58| So that financial impact on an old contract is going to be a challenge for any provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3718)|
| 1:02:04| irrespective of its American medical response to the next one that was in this contract you have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3724)|
| 1:02:10| What is also going to be a challenge, Bart, is the longer this drags out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| I can tell you after running systems and being a part of private systems in my early years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3734)|
| 1:02:19| contracting timeframes become challenges just from staffing because people, it's the unknown unknown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3739)|
| 1:02:25| And so as you start walking into contract cycles, you do have that challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| Now, if it's something locally, we didn't go in and review AMR specific, any of the management on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3749)|
| 1:02:36| We didn't review AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| So I couldn't tell you what their specific challenges is for staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| I can just tell you that in the market space, it's a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3762)|
| 1:02:46| We're starting to do in some of our programs with our management services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| we're having to do what we call just teaching EMT classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| bringing people with no experience just to bolster staffing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| paying to go into paramedics or paying people to change industries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3777)|
| 1:03:01| We used to not have to pay for that as an industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| We used to have people come in, they would volunteer at nights, they would get their EMTs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| they would pay for their own paramedic, and then they would come be a provider and happily love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| And then they would stay or maybe they transition to somewhere else in the health care system or public safety system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3793)|
| 1:03:19| The reality is now, though, we're having to attract people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| We're having to train them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| We're having to onboard them at the same time as the markets are shifting under our feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3804)|
| 1:03:30| Mr. Barton, I might be getting ahead of ourselves in the process, so tell me if I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3810)|
| 1:03:37| Based upon the report that we've been given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| will we have the option to say we want our own dispatch to handle things with our own software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3821)|
| 1:03:51| and let's piece that out, that we want decedent transport to be in a different bucket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3831)|
| 1:03:57| or is it just going to come as a lump sum recommendation that it's yay or nay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3837)|
| 1:04:05| So the RFP has already been released and we're going through the evaluation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3845)|
| 1:04:11| As Director Myers will tell you, all points inside the RFP are negotiable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3851)|
| 1:04:17| He's said that many a times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| Inside the RFP, decedent transport is separate in terms of response time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3860)|
| 1:04:26| We do have clinical control with the medical director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| We will also have the utilities that Mr. Sheridan was talking about from a software standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3871)|
| 1:04:38| There was the option for them to bid and provide cost for two models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3878)|
| 1:04:45| One was they will dispatch and triage their calls themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3885)|
| 1:04:54| Director Anders' team would take that call, triage it, and then send it for dispatch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3894)|
| 1:05:01| So there is two separate models depending upon what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3901)|
| 1:05:05| So when all those things come to us as a legislative body, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| is it coming with recommendations of this, that, and the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3909)|
| 1:05:13| It will come as a single contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3915)|
| 1:05:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| Thank you for the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| It's been extremely helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| Unfortunately, I have had to be at the emergency room with one of my boys twice in the last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3927)|
| 1:05:34| So hopefully none of the other commissioners have had to go to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3934)|
| 1:05:39| But you probably should walk in there and see how bad it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| It was unbelievable the other day when we had to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| the amount of people just in the hallways back in the emergency room, not even out front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3948)|
| 1:05:54| So obviously we have a staffing issue at the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| We have this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| And this has been a major issue, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| probably for all the commissioners have heard about the wall time and that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| I guess my question is, is AMR or any other ambulance service required once they are in the hospital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3966)|
| 1:06:17| Is that now legally the hospital's patient, or are they still in charge of this person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3977)|
| 1:06:25| And I think that's where some confusion, and that's what I would like to kind of answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| because I also understand that if you are an EMT, if you're a paramedic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| if you're a firefighter or a police officer, you want to see that person through that situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3993)|
| 1:06:39| and you don't want to feel like you're dumping them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| But when we're in the situation where we don't have enough ambulances or people to get to people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| then that makes it a whole other issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| And so some of the challenge parts right now is just that learning of who's responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4009)|
| 1:06:57| Now, there's certain requirements for the hospital that anybody that's within 200 feet of the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4017)|
| 1:07:03| it's their responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| Now, it is their responsibility, but there's also continuity of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4025)|
| 1:07:09| So taking ownership of that patient, getting them registered, transitioning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| giving that provider feedback to make sure that you're giving that quality of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| Now, what I will say is if you have somebody in the field that needs to be transitioned out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4038)|
| 1:07:23| absolutely it's good to give quick turnover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| There also needs to be processes for both the EMS provider and the hospital to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4046)|
| 1:07:31| this patient's going to immediately go to triage, this patient's going to immediately go to a room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4051)|
| 1:07:35| this is going to be a situation that has to be on a wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4055)|
| 1:07:39| In certain areas they have teams of nurses that actually manage the wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| or they partner with or have to work with the EMS provider to make a cluster of patients being seen by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4063)|
| 1:07:50| one or two providers so they can resource back into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| There are a lot of ways people are still trying to tackle that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| So to answer your question, there is that piece about 200 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| However, there are some challenges as it relates to how that's applied operationally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4082)|
| 1:08:08| to make sure that continuity of care for patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| Yeah, and especially if you've got one nurse to 20 patients at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| it's kind of hard to have nurses out in the hallway with the patients that are on the bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4094)|
| 1:08:18| And they have tough jobs just like the paramedics and the EMTs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| Yeah, it's definitely a multifaceted, like you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| Thank you for your information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you for a really great report and study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4107)|
| 1:08:31| This is long overdue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| And I want to thank all of our emergency response agencies for really working hard through some very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4113)|
| 1:08:39| and trying and challenging times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| I know it's been kind of tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| And please excuse me if some of my questions or just asking for clarification on some of these points is very elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4125)|
| 1:08:51| There's a lot of moving parts here, a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| And, you know, we're not in this day in and day out like you all are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| But I kind of just going through the report, starting with it states that you were evaluating the entire EMS system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4138)|
| 1:09:07| but it didn't include all of the emergency response agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4147)|
| 1:09:12| And it goes into the method was counting the numbers of service requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| including both dispatches and the calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| and then tabulating the total number of resources that responded to these requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| So my question is, so how are the numbers accurate when, for instance, KFD was not included in those calculations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4163)|
| 1:09:30| KFD and other agencies, they've been left out of the study, but they are expected to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4170)|
| 1:09:36| So if you could first touch on that clarification point, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4176)|
| 1:09:41| So two parts of the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| Number one is the data that was asked of us to use to evaluate your system actually came from American Medical Response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4183)|
| 1:09:52| So when we worked through our process, when we talked to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| the cleanest set of data that you had for us to be able to process was from American Medical Response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| So there was no other data for us to be able to go through and work with from a first response perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4200)|
| 1:10:06| So as we started to walk through that, that was the design component to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4206)|
| 1:10:10| understanding that you already have the medical first response within the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4210)|
| 1:10:15| The second part to that was to look at the EMS system as it relates to the contract moving forward for the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4215)|
| 1:10:21| So the design was for moving forward, and that's why the accrediting model that we used allowed for using that first unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4221)|
| 1:10:29| based around the medical first response and the second unit being around the transport unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4229)|
| 1:10:36| so we could model that for you and within your community because of some of those limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| So with the RFP, is it based on including those responses or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4241)|
| 1:10:48| Because I'm just concerned that our RFP isn't going to fully have the scope of service that is actually our model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4248)|
| 1:10:58| or who we're responding to, I mean, especially in the Mission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4258)|
| 1:11:03| I mean, that's the portion of the city that causes significant demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| It will require a multifaceted and multidisciplinary approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| So the EMS contractor gets that burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| Well, my first thought was, well, why are we not contracting with KFD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| Are we fully utilizing the agencies that we have or any other nonprofits that could assist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4277)|
| 1:11:25| We've actually started looking into that one particular area just probably about a month ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4285)|
| 1:11:35| because it would take more than a paramedic or an EMT to handle such volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4295)|
| 1:11:42| Your basic EMT cannot tell an individual that has called 911 that they should not go to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4302)|
| 1:11:49| They are designed to transport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| So what we've done, our public health officer, Dr. Edwards, brought in the groups that work inside that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4312)|
| 1:11:59| so your BMCs and your CARMS and Salvation Army, to start looking at alternative service methods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4319)|
| 1:12:09| We looked at last year's calls, and it was 2,100 transports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4329)|
| 1:12:14| Almost half of those were low acuity, meaning we used a unit to transport an individual probably to UT Medical Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4334)|
| 1:12:22| that probably didn't need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| So how do we put providers down in that area to address that before the call is ever made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4345)|
| 1:12:32| We also found that a majority of those calls were made right before the medical staff at CARMS actually comes in at 7 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4352)|
| 1:12:39| So it's shift change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| So can we just bring somebody in a little bit earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| Can we have local area hospitals bring in a provider to help us with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4363)|
| 1:12:50| What does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| To address that problem is much more than local EMS or first responders addressing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4372)|
| 1:13:00| It takes many more people than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| And you talked about requiring a software program that automates the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4382)|
| 1:13:07| and I found it very interesting that it stated that this is currently done manually, which is a little frightening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4387)|
| 1:13:14| Does the RFP state that the contractor will own and operate their own operational and clinical performance software at their cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4394)|
| 1:13:22| And if so, does that mean that we, again, don't have or own the data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4402)|
| 1:13:28| We own the software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| We will ask the contractor to pay for that software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| That data will be ours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| It will be, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4416)|
| 1:13:37| Right now, for instance, if you were to have a constituent reach out with a complaint or an issue or questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4417)|
| 1:13:47| everything is retrospective and also manually calculating time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4427)|
| 1:13:54| I get data from AMR and then I call Director Anders' group up and I get their data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| and I compare them to make sure that they're the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| And then you have to manually add things together to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| And I know at one time we had talked about the transport of deceased persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| possibly carving that out of the scope of services, but it was still included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4451)|
| 1:14:17| It was, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| I say we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4458)|
| 1:14:19| The county went to bid for that, and Director Myers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4459)|
| 1:14:24| I want to believe we didn't actually get any responses the first time we bid that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4464)|
| 1:14:31| And let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| And I know this is a very elementary question, deployment modeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| Just a fact-based, how many ambulances do we need to cover our county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4476)|
| 1:14:44| I mean, just as simple and elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| Depends on the hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| I mean, how many resources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| I mean, I know it's a moving target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| It's a totally moving target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| But then my question is how do we measure efficiency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| And then what is the standard wait time for a county this size?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| What have you seen in other counties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| So I'll just answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| So depending on the model you chose, and here was the 10-20 model, which the county chose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4503)|
| 1:15:09| it would be 17 at peak a day for ALS and it would be four at 24-7 for BLS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4509)|
| 1:15:15| And so that's where our modeling goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| Now, that was what we looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| And, again, by system design, by challenges you might have in the hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4519)|
| 1:15:23| you may have to increase that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| It's just going to all depend on what your contractor is going to ultimately deploy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| Now, that was our modeling for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| which is more than you're currently to perform to 17 minutes a day is going to be expected of your contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4531)|
| 1:15:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| And that, you know, my last, well, almost last question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| do you think that that can be accomplished with one contractor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| I mean, it states in this several times about multi-agency, multifaceted approaches, tiered responses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4548)|
| 1:15:55| and then you said that anything in the RFP and the proposals that receive, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4555)|
| 1:16:01| every point can be taken into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| Are we considering more than one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| Contractors have the ability to work together to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4567)|
| 1:16:13| So if two agencies wanted to work together, they could do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| However, there would be one agency that would be the true contracted agency for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4577)|
| 1:16:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4586)|
| 1:16:27| Have we reached out to funeral homes about deceased transport?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4587)|
| 1:16:32| That one I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| Director Myers, do you, decedent transport, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4596)|
| 1:16:42| Yeah, the decedent transport RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4602)|
| 1:16:47| Commissioner Frazier had a question about decedent transports and the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4607)|
| 1:16:52| I was just wondering, have we reached out to our funeral homes about potential contracts with them for deceased transports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4612)|
| 1:16:59| It has been a couple of years when we reached out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| Very few were interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4622)|
| 1:17:05| Keep in mind, you know, we've had this COVID thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| It's been around since, what, 1920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| So we have not reached back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4632)|
| 1:17:13| We did, as Mr. Parton said, issue a solicitation several years ago, had two respondents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4633)|
| 1:17:20| We just at that time did not have the funds to go in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4640)|
| 1:17:25| I guess I'm asking, you know, do we have some flexibility here to be creative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| or are we just, I feel like, and I've spent so many hours just researching and Googling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4650)|
| 1:17:38| and looking at other areas and how they're responding to these situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4658)|
| 1:17:43| And every time it takes multiple agencies, a coordination of those services, even nonprofit agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4663)|
| 1:17:52| And I just don't, I just worry that this pigeon holes us a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4672)|
| 1:17:56| So I want to make sure that as a county to provide the most comprehensive emergency response services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4676)|
| 1:18:03| to every citizen in every corner of this county, we are looking at every available resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4683)|
| 1:18:12| And so that's, just want to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4692)|
| 1:18:15| And then the medical director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| Is this part time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| And is it the same, the system medical director, it says we'll have authority over the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| 911 comms, EMS contractor and first responding agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4704)|
| 1:18:28| But I think the RFP states it as a part time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| I can tell you from experience, it absolutely is not a part time job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4711)|
| 1:18:37| And at $50,000, you're not going to get anybody to do the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4717)|
| 1:18:45| So that's all going to be derived from what you want locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| So I will tell you in other systems similar to the size of this, that is what they see is about a part time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4728)|
| 1:18:53| And that's what we've seen other folks pay for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| So that's not abnormal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| Now it all depends again on what you're looking for and what your community wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| If you have one individual that is full time and the county wants to pursue that and take on that cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4740)|
| 1:19:06| it's a local policy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| However, it's all about how that level of engagement that you want from the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4748)|
| 1:19:14| So again, it's how you want to design that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| However, the option for making sure that as you walk through the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4757)|
| 1:19:21| our goal for that recommendation for you is to ensure you have that systematic approach to quality of care for the citizens here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4761)|
| 1:19:30| Those are all my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4770)|
| 1:19:31| Thank you for your patience very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4773)|
| 1:19:34| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| Commissioners, I know we still have two lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| We're running a little short on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4779)|
| 1:19:43| Are these short questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4786)|
| 1:19:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| This summer, the state of Tennessee, their health services and development agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4790)|
| 1:19:56| who are the ones that are responsible for issuing the Certificate of Needs for hospitals and communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4796)|
| 1:20:04| and they had an application in front of them for a freestanding emergency room facility at the intersection of Middlebrook Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4804)|
| 1:20:14| and Weisgarber Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| And for whatever reason, they turned down that application for a freestanding additional emergency room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4817)|
| 1:20:25| So if we would have had six emergency rooms online than we currently have now of five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4825)|
| 1:20:33| in your professional opinion, would that have reduced wall times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4833)|
| 1:20:37| I don't know what I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| And here's why I'll say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| That's not something we do as a firm, studying that side for the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| So I wouldn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| But I couldn't even gather to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| I don't know if you have enough nursing resources to handle that in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| So that's an unknown unknown for me that I really couldn't be able to comment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| But, I mean, obviously if they're going to go to the expense of running a 24-hour emergency room facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4857)|
| 1:21:03| they're going to have it staffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| But I was just surprised that they turned it down in a size of a community that's growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4865)|
| 1:21:10| Yeah, it's a freestanding ED, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| But if it's an urgent care, again, from a 911 response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| we don't have the ability really to transport to urgent cares from a 911 response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| No, no, this is an emergency room only, fully staffed, trauma, the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4880)|
| 1:21:24| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4884)|
| 1:21:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4886)|
| 1:21:27| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| Director Partin, Director Myers, next month when this comes to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4891)|
| 1:21:37| are we going to vote on your recommendation for one provider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4897)|
| 1:21:42| Will we have a choice of two providers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| Or how is this going to be presented to us in November?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| Because right now I don't know what we're going to be looking at, how to vote or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4908)|
| 1:21:54| So if you could explain the process of how many, one, two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4914)|
| 1:22:02| My understanding of the process is the evaluation committee will make a recommendation to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4922)|
| 1:22:08| That will obviously be discussed with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| And the recommendation that comes before this body will be for one of those models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4931)|
| 1:22:17| We don't pick and choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| So you will get a recommendation on one of the models,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4940)|
| 1:22:24| the one that we feel is the best fit for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4944)|
| 1:22:28| That's the way I thought it would happen because we're sitting up here asking questions that we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4948)|
| 1:22:35| We're not on the committee, so we don't know what's happening in the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| So it will come out of the committee as who they recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231016-ems-evaluation?start=4958)|
