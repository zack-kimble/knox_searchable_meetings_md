| 5:22:47| Madam Clerk, I don't see anything in O or P or in our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19367)|
| 5:22:52| We do have one final public forum item, as I mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19372)|
| 5:22:58| If that person is with us, Megan Wiley Potts, is Ms. Potts with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19378)|
| 5:23:08| I believe I see her on the list, but I don't see or hear her yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19388)|
| 5:23:12| If she's here, just let her in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19392)|
| 5:23:14| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19394)|
| 5:23:15| Ms. Potts, if you could unmute and turn your camera on and join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19395)|
| 5:23:20| We are moving on to item number Q, which is the second half of our public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19400)|
| 5:23:25| for items that are not on our agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19405)|
| 5:23:28| If you would, please state your name and your county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19408)|
| 5:23:34| and you have five minutes to address the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19414)|
| 5:23:37| Okay, excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19417)|
| 5:23:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19418)|
| 5:23:39| Hello, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19419)|
| 5:23:40| My name is Megan Wiley Potts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19420)|
| 5:23:42| I live in District 4 of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19422)|
| 5:23:46| I live in Bexhill Subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19426)|
| 5:23:50| I am coming before you today on an item that is not on your agenda until April, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19430)|
| 5:23:57| but Mr. Jay was kind enough to allow me to speak to you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19437)|
| 5:24:03| It's an item of critical importance for my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19443)|
| 5:24:08| I don't know if you are familiar with the Bluegrass Ebenezer area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19448)|
| 5:24:13| I live in Bexhill Subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19453)|
| 5:24:15| There is a large field that has been here since the neighborhood was developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19455)|
| 5:24:22| and it is used frequently by children and sports teams in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19462)|
| 5:24:30| Last Saturday, a developer called for a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19470)|
| 5:24:34| and Hall Rob Real Estate Developers wants to put a strip mall in that field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19474)|
| 5:24:42| I am here tonight representing residents of the Bexhill Subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19482)|
| 5:24:48| and we are against this development for some critical reasons that I'd like to share with you briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19488)|
| 5:24:57| The shopping center is a strip mall, as I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19497)|
| 5:25:00| The only two entrances are using our subdivision's private, unscaled roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19500)|
| 5:25:07| The developer mentioned having restaurants in the strip mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19507)|
| 5:25:12| which would require semi-delivery, which could not happen on private neighborhood roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19512)|
| 5:25:18| In fact, the address is 1401 Bexhill, which is a private neighborhood road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19518)|
| 5:25:25| The strip mall would be approximately one block from Bluegrass Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19525)|
| 5:25:31| which is within the parental responsibility zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19531)|
| 5:25:34| My children walk to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19534)|
| 5:25:36| Many parents in our community send their children to school by walking or riding a bicycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19536)|
| 5:25:43| The increased vehicle traffic and foot traffic in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19543)|
| 5:25:47| would pose significant risk to our children, and we are obviously concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19547)|
| 5:25:54| If you all have ever been in the area at 730 or 430, you know that it is a heavily congested area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19554)|
| 5:26:01| And the addition of a shopping center would further complicate traffic patterns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19561)|
| 5:26:06| and be dangerous for our children walking to school during those hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19566)|
| 5:26:13| There is a drainage issue when it rains heavily at the entrance of Bexhill subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19573)|
| 5:26:21| There is high water there, and we are concerned about high water being exacerbated by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19581)|
| 5:26:29| development. Finally, if you look at the aerial photographs, you haven't seen them yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19589)|
| 5:26:35| but the developer put out aerial photographs. This field is the only green space in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19595)|
| 5:26:42| Ebenezer Bluegrass area. And again, it's heavily used by residents and non-residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19602)|
| 5:26:49| Bearden High School Ultimate Frisbee team uses it for practices and games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19609)|
| 5:26:54| Soccer teams use it for practices, and we want to preserve it. We have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19614)|
| 5:27:01| we're obviously at the very beginning organizing stages right now because the meeting was this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19621)|
| 5:27:07| past Saturday, but we have been in contact with Legacy Parks. We've reached out to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19627)|
| 5:27:14| We hope to work with them to preserve the green space that we have in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19634)|
| 5:27:19| And we also did some digging and found that the last time the land was purchased was in 1998.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19639)|
| 5:27:28| It was purchased from Mr. Weigel by Home Federal Bank, and the deed of the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19648)|
| 5:27:35| gave three restrictions. There were to be no establishments selling beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19655)|
| 5:27:42| there were to be no fast food restaurants, and there were to be no grocery stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19662)|
| 5:27:48| Those restrictions apply to any successor for the next 25 years, which would be Hall-Rob purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19668)|
| 5:27:56| the property, and all three of those, well, no grocery store, but beer selling establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19676)|
| 5:28:03| and fast food restaurants were included in the drawings that we saw. That would expire in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19683)|
| 5:28:11| December of 2023. We realize that the developer will go before the NPC. We plan to show up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19691)|
| 5:28:21| We plan to make our voices heard, and we would like to request that the County Commission just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19701)|
| 5:28:28| give us some time to delay and potentially purchase this land to create a park or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19708)|
| 5:28:36| preserve the green space that we have in our community. And again, thank you for letting me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19716)|
| 5:28:42| speak. I appreciate it. Thank you, Ms. Potts, for being patient and sitting through most of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19722)|
| 5:28:50| meeting. And you're welcome to come back anytime. We will certainly take up this matter as it goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19730)|
| 5:28:56| through Planning Commission that comes before us. So thank you for being here today. Thank you very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19736)|
| 5:29:02| much. You're welcome. And that concludes the second half of public forum. Commissioner Skinner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19742)|
| 5:29:10| may I care? Yeah, would this be appropriate to make some comments to Mrs. Potts at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19750)|
| 5:29:16| I think that to me, I think that until we have until this body has all the information before it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19756)|
| 5:29:22| with some information presented by both sides, and it's probably premature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19762)|
| 5:29:28| Thank you, sir. Ms. Potts, I will say if you have any additional information you would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19768)|
| 5:29:32| us to look at, you can always send that to commission at knoxcounty.org. And that will go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19772)|
| 5:29:38| to all of our commissioners for further review. Okay, great. I actually used that email to email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19778)|
| 5:29:43| all of you yesterday. So I know you're with that email. And if I may attach the plans that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19783)|
| 5:29:49| from... Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19789)|
| 5:29:51| Okay. Yes, I'll do that. Thank you all for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19791)|
| 5:29:53| You're very welcome. That concludes the second half of our public forum. Item Q,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19793)|
| 5:29:59| is there any other business to come before this body here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19799)|
| 5:30:05| Commissioner Lundy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19805)|
| 5:30:08| I just want to tell people, ask people to keep off me, send our prayers. Since our last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19808)|
| 5:30:15| we did lose another young lady. So the community is hurting. So just please keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19815)|
| 5:30:21| AE in your prayers. Thank you. Thank you very much. Any other business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19821)|
| 5:30:27| to come before this body? Seeing none, I'll entertain a motion to adjourn to now. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19827)|
| 5:30:34| Biggs. Sorry about that. I just wanted to make it known really quick that Director Anders from 9-1-1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19834)|
| 5:30:43| got the opportunity to go to something he had. We can now text 9-1-1. I know a lot of you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19843)|
| 5:30:48| already heard that, but the slogan is if you can't talk, then text. So that should help out a lot with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19848)|
| 5:30:55| trafficking and domestic assault, different kind of situation as well as the hearing impaired. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19855)|
| 5:31:00| that could help a lot of people out in your district. So just making it known. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19860)|
| 5:31:07| Thank you very much. Any other business to come before the commission tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19867)|
| 5:31:12| Motion to adjourn. Is there a second? Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19872)|
| 5:31:18| Second by Commissioner Wheeler, first by Commissioner Daley. Enjoy your Monday evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19878)|
| 5:31:23| This meeting is now adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19883)|
