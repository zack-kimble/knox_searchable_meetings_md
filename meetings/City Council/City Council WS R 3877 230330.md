|     119 |   121 | Yes, thank you so much.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=119.0)  |
|     121 |   122 | It is a beautiful day here,                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=121.0)  |
|     122 |   130 | and I had the opportunity to join about 60 other people at the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors this morning,                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=122.0)  |
|     130 |   137 | where the Opticos team gave this presentation to people at that meeting and a lot of real estate professionals,                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=130.0)  |
|     137 |   142 | and it was great to hear their questions and input and thoughts and reactions.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=137.0)  |
|     142 |   147 | And so I'm really glad that they're going to be here today to present to all of you                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=142.0)  |
|     147 |   152 | because the missing middle housing is something that I've been thinking about                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=147.0)  |
|     152 |   158 | and think that, you know, we have a housing crisis in our city, and we need more housing.                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=152.0)  |
|     158 |   161 | And sometimes what's old is new again,                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=158.0)  |
|     161 |   169 | and sometimes the solutions that were the way housing was done in the past can be something that we look at as a model for consideration    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=161.0)  |
|     169 |   172 | as we move forward and think about ways to address this crisis.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=169.0)  |
|     172 |   175 | So I look forward to ‑‑ I'm not going to be able to stay.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=172.0)  |
|     175 |   180 | I'm going to launch the Big Ears Festival in a few minutes,                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=175.0)  |
|     180 |   187 | but I do think that you're going to be inspired and have a lot of questions about this,                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=180.0)  |
|     187 |   193 | and I am committed to learning from the community, learning from all of you, and moving forward with this,                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=187.0)  |
|     193 |   201 | but in a way where we just do it in a really smart, strategic way that is with the support of the community.                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=193.0)  |
|     201 |   211 | And I'm confident that if we, you know, listen and learn and do it, it's going to be a key, one of many strategies.                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=201.0)  |
|     211 |   215 | As you guys know, we've been doing many efforts on the housing front,                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=211.0)  |
|     215 |   221 | and you guys have just been really leading that effort in a budgetary way, in a policy way, in shaping that agenda,                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=215.0)  |
|     221 |   226 | and this is just one other strategy that can help us address this housing supply issue.                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=221.0)  |

|     267 |   269 | I believe that's in two days.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=267.0)  |

|     277 |   282 | Well, first of all, thank you very much for having us here at Optikos Design,                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=277.0)  |
|     282 |   286 | invited to the city to present on this, and just to remind everyone,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=282.0)  |
|     286 |   292 | we prepared an analysis that we'll talk about here in a little bit.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=286.0)  |
|     292 |   295 | We prepared it last September, and it's called the Missing Middle Scan.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=292.0)  |

|     300 |   308 | So today's presentation, we're going to talk about what is missing middle,                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=300.0)  |
|     308 |   313 | why is it needed, what are the barriers and some best practices,                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=308.0)  |
|     313 |   315 | what are the opportunities here in Knoxville,                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=313.0)  |
|     315 |   320 | what do we recommend that you get started to do to implement missing middle,                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=315.0)  |
|     320 |   324 | and then your questions and discussions, obviously.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=320.0)  |
|     324 |   329 | The idea of missing middle can be summed up into this one liner,                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=324.0)  |
|     329 |   333 | house-scale buildings with multiple units in walkable neighborhoods.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=329.0)  |
|     333 |   339 | And the really interesting thing about this phrase is that regular apartment development,                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=333.0)  |
|     339 |   347 | which is good and has its purpose, can be one or two of these, sometimes all three of these,                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=339.0)  |
|     347 |   350 | but missing middle is always all three of these,                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=347.0)  |
|     350 |   354 | house-scale buildings with multiple units in walkable neighborhoods.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=350.0)  |
|     354 |   355 | Go ahead.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=354.0)  |
|     355 |   356 | And it's missing.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=355.0)  |
|     356 |   362 | We call it missing because, as you may or may not know, over the past 80 years,                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=356.0)  |
|     362 |   370 | the emphasis has been on building houses and building townhouses more recently                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=362.0)  |
|     370 |   373 | and then building apartments, big apartments.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=370.0)  |
|     373 |   377 | And so the term missing means that there's a whole spectrum of housing choices,                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=373.0)  |
|     377 |   382 | and that middle portion of the spectrum has been missing for the past 80 years.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=377.0)  |
|     382 |   383 | Next.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=382.0)  |
|     383 |   385 | And, again, this isn't new.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=383.0)  |
|     385 |   389 | This is something actually you have here in your community.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=385.0)  |
|     389 |   395 | The Sears houses, for example, that are all over the country from east to west,                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=389.0)  |
|     395 |   399 | were ordered out of a catalog, and here's an example of one of those pages.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=395.0)  |
|     399 |   403 | And my understanding is one of those architects actually worked in Knoxville                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=399.0)  |
|     403 |   406 | or was from Knoxville, Mr. Barber, I think.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=403.0)  |
|     406 |   411 | So those houses, you could order them from a catalog like here on the screen.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=406.0)  |
|     411 |   416 | And one of the interesting things about that is that if you see the little arrows there on the right-hand side,                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=411.0)  |
|     416 |   419 | you can't see the text, but what they're pointing to is it says,                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=416.0)  |
|     419 |   425 | this building fits on a lot 40 feet wide or this building fits on a lot 50 feet wide.                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=419.0)  |
|     425 |   431 | And unlike a lot of the zoning processes that we've all become accustomed to across the country                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=425.0)  |
|     431 |   435 | where you need all this special review and variances and everything else,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=431.0)  |
|     435 |   440 | they were making these to fit lots that existed in neighborhoods 100 years ago.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=435.0)  |
|     440 |   442 | So there wasn't any mystery to it.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=440.0)  |
|     442 |   443 | Next.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=442.0)  |
|     443 |   448 | So we're going to talk about this palette of missing middle types, and it has different names.                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=443.0)  |
|     448 |   452 | Each of them have different names depending on where you are in the country.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=448.0)  |
|     452 |   460 | But there are eight to ten depending on, you know, how you slice them, how you name them.                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=452.0)  |
|     460 |   464 | And we've categorized them into small and medium,                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=460.0)  |
|     464 |   467 | and then there's this category large that I want to talk about.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=464.0)  |
|     467 |   470 | So we'll get into this next.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=467.0)  |
|     470 |   474 | But also just quickly, the whole spectrum that we're going to talk about,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=470.0)  |
|     474 |   479 | it's not intended as all of it needs to happen every place you do missing middle.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=474.0)  |
|     479 |   483 | Rather, maybe the small portion of the spectrum works in one neighborhood                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=479.0)  |
|     483 |   487 | and the medium works in another, and maybe a portion of the medium works.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=483.0)  |
|     487 |   489 | It's divisible.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=487.0)  |
|     489 |   493 | It's not intended that you apply it full strength everywhere.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=489.0)  |
|     493 |   498 | So the first one is duplex side-by-side, and I've seen several of these here in Knoxville,                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=493.0)  |
|     498 |   501 | and as the name suggests, there are two units side-by-side.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=498.0)  |
|     501 |   507 | But unlike two big houses that could be glued together and provide two big houses                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=501.0)  |
|     507 |   513 | and be called a duplex, the missing middle version of the duplex is, remember, house scale.                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=507.0)  |
|     513 |   515 | It's the size of houses in the neighborhood,                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=513.0)  |
|     515 |   521 | and so both of those units fit inside the scale of what would otherwise be one house.                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=515.0)  |
|     521 |   522 | Next.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=521.0)  |
|     522 |   528 | The duplex stack is its cousin, and it's narrower because it's not side-by-side.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=522.0)  |
|     528 |   533 | It's able to fit on a narrower lot, and it's one flat on top of the other.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=528.0)  |
|     533 |   538 | I want to call your attention to the bottom right portion of that yellow banner that's on each slide,                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=533.0)  |
|     538 |   542 | and you'll see that in addition to the lot size characteristics                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=538.0)  |
|     542 |   548 | that may or may not be readable at this scale, these examples were measured.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=542.0)  |
|     548 |   557 | And whatever those measurements were, so, for example, 50 by 130, 50-foot wide lot by 130 feet deep,                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=548.0)  |
|     557 |   561 | that equals a certain density when you multiply out the two units on there.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=557.0)  |
|     561 |   566 | In this case, the ones we measured are 13 to 25 to the acre.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=561.0)  |
|     566 |   568 | Next.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=566.0)  |
|     568 |   570 | The cottage court, we're moving up the spectrum.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=568.0)  |
|     570 |   573 | We're still at the small end of the scale of the missing middle housing.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=570.0)  |
|     573 |   580 | Cottage court is, as its name suggests, a series of cottages that are detached from each other,                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=573.0)  |
|     580 |   583 | and they're usually one story, and they're arranged around a garden,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=580.0)  |
|     583 |   588 | and often, but not always, there's a two-story cottage at the end of the garden,                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=583.0)  |
|     588 |   593 | as you can see in this example, and sometimes that building has two units, maybe three.                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=588.0)  |
|     593 |   595 | Next.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=593.0)  |
|     595 |   599 | And then the triplex fourplex, which you have several examples here,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=595.0)  |
|     599 |   602 | and you can see that number again in the bottom right of that banner.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=599.0)  |
|     602 |   607 | Here, these examples range from 24 to the acre to 29 to the acre,                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=602.0)  |
|     607 |   610 | and I want to call your attention to that number, these density numbers,                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=607.0)  |
|     610 |   617 | because I think we've been accustomed to or trained by our experiences across the U.S.                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=610.0)  |
|     617 |   620 | that density, the lower the number, the better,                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=617.0)  |
|     620 |   625 | and so when you do the math on some of these missing middle types, it's just a fact.                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=620.0)  |
|     625 |   627 | You measure it, and it comes out to be these numbers.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=625.0)  |
|     627 |   633 | It often doesn't jive with the zoning system that cities have,                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=627.0)  |
|     633 |   635 | and that's because it precedes that.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=633.0)  |
|     635 |   638 | So I just want to call that to your attention.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=635.0)  |
|     638 |   643 | But going up the scale a little more, now we're at the medium portion of that spectrum,                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=638.0)  |
|     643 |   647 | and this is what is often called a mansion apartment in many communities                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=643.0)  |
|     647 |   650 | or what we call it a multiplex medium.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=647.0)  |
|     650 |   654 | And you first look at it like I did in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, this example,                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=650.0)  |
|     654 |   659 | and I thought, wow, that's a beautiful house, and the guides told me, no, that's five units.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=654.0)  |
|     659 |   661 | And so I said, oh, that's a mansion apartment.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=659.0)  |
|     661 |   665 | And so you look at it, and it just fits in with all the other houses.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=661.0)  |
|     665 |   670 | Again, that house scale characteristic of missing middle is super important                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=665.0)  |
|     670 |   673 | because the second you stop making them house scale,                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=670.0)  |
|     673 |   677 | it's hard to make the case that they can fit into neighborhoods of houses.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=673.0)  |
|     677 |   679 | Next.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=677.0)  |
|     679 |   682 | And then this one, going up the scale or spectrum again,                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=679.0)  |
|     682 |   689 | this is the courtyard where the cottage court was these detached one-story cottages around a garden.                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=682.0)  |
|     689 |   691 | The courtyard is its cousin.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=689.0)  |
|     691 |   695 | It attaches the cottages and makes them two stories around a garden,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=691.0)  |
|     695 |   699 | and all the entrances face it, and the garden is open to the street.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=695.0)  |
|     699 |   701 | Next.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=699.0)  |
|     701 |   706 | And then lastly, the townhouse, and the townhouse comes in a few varieties,                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=701.0)  |
|     706 |   709 | sometimes three to four in a row, two stories,                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=706.0)  |
|     709 |   713 | and in this case, this one is a little longer, five or six in a row,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=709.0)  |
|     713 |   715 | depending on where you are in the city.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=713.0)  |
|     715 |   721 | And then one more here, the three-story version of the mansion apartment.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=715.0)  |
|     721 |   727 | I put this one in here to show that everything up until this point was small or medium,                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=721.0)  |
|     727 |   729 | and this is when you get into the large,                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=727.0)  |
|     729 |   733 | and you have really beautiful examples of the large missing middle here.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=729.0)  |
|     733 |   738 | They're the three-story brick buildings on the busier streets here in the center of the city                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=733.0)  |
|     738 |   744 | with the balconies on the third, second, and the porches on the ground floor.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=738.0)  |
|     744 |   751 | And it's really important to know that the large, when we say missing middle and we just talk about it,                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=744.0)  |
|     751 |   754 | we're talking about the small and medium, and the large is an exception.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=751.0)  |
|     754 |   761 | It has its place, but it's not what we tend to mean when we talk about missing middle in general                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=754.0)  |
|     761 |   764 | because this doesn't fit in all neighborhoods.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=761.0)  |
|     764 |   767 | All the other ones do fit in neighborhoods.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=764.0)  |
|     767 |   771 | And look at the, just before we leave it, look at the density in this one.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=767.0)  |
|     771 |   777 | It's 12 units in each of them, so four units per floor, 12 units in each,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=771.0)  |
|     777 |   780 | and the density is 50 to 57 to the acre.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=777.0)  |
|     780 |   781 | They're beautiful buildings.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=780.0)  |
|     781 |   787 | They're actually about, I want to say, 10 to 15 years old in Athens, Georgia.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=781.0)  |
|     787 |   788 | Next.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=787.0)  |
|     788 |   794 | So I'm going to show you some examples of applying these ideas besides the project I just showed you,                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=788.0)  |
|     794 |   798 | projects that we have worked on to build missing middle.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=794.0)  |
|     798 |   801 | First one is here in California on the screen.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=798.0)  |
|     801 |   805 | It's 12 cottages around a garden.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=801.0)  |
|     805 |   812 | It's the cottage court type, and this cottage court is a result of a process with the city                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=805.0)  |
|     812 |   817 | and the neighbors that the developer went through, and the zoning rules didn't allow it,                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=812.0)  |
|     817 |   821 | and so they went through this process and arrived at this design.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=817.0)  |
|     821 |   823 | Next.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=821.0)  |
|     823 |   824 | This one is a version of that.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=823.0)  |
|     824 |   829 | It's also around a garden, a much more constrained parcel in Seattle,                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=824.0)  |
|     829 |   835 | and it's eight cottages with four accessory dwelling units around that garden                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=829.0)  |
|     835 |   839 | for a total of 12 units on this property.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=835.0)  |
|     839 |   842 | And then in West Village, Florence, Alabama,                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=839.0)  |
|     842 |   846 | we are currently working on a project that includes four courtyard buildings                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=842.0)  |
|     846 |   848 | and several mixed-use buildings.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=846.0)  |
|     848 |   851 | You can see the site plan there on the right                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=848.0)  |
|     851 |   854 | and the courtyard there on the main part of the screen.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=851.0)  |
|     854 |   856 | The buildings are arranged in a courtyard fashion                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=854.0)  |
|     856 |   860 | with this shared courtyard in the middle of all the units.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=856.0)  |
|     860 |   865 | This one is a version of a townhouse in South Jordan, Utah,                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=860.0)  |
|     865 |   867 | and a big master plan community.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=865.0)  |
|     867 |   870 | If you go to the next slide, yeah, this one.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=867.0)  |
|     870 |   874 | So you can see the colored buildings, the blue, yellow, and red there.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=870.0)  |
|     874 |   878 | That's the project, and it was in this remnant piece of a block                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=874.0)  |
|     878 |   883 | that the developer had left over between these buildings that they developed,                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=878.0)  |
|     883 |   885 | and they approached us and said,                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=883.0)  |
|     885 |   889 | We need something to go into this swath of land that we don't want to waste.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=885.0)  |
|     889 |   892 | What could we do with such a narrow strip?                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=889.0)  |
|     892 |   897 | And so the office took the townhouse and turned it on its side                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=892.0)  |
|     897 |   900 | so that the long end is along this pedestrian muse.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=897.0)  |
|     900 |   907 | And so Dan Parolek gave the name Muse Townhouse to this missing middle type.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=900.0)  |
|     907 |   911 | And one of the features here is that because of the way this was delivered                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=907.0)  |
|     911 |   916 | on the amount of land that it was delivered and in the score footages,                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=911.0)  |
|     916 |   919 | this was able to beat the price points of the townhouses                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=916.0)  |
|     919 |   922 | that this developer was selling in the same project                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=919.0)  |
|     922 |   926 | by I think I want to say 25 percent.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=922.0)  |

|     929 |   931 | than the rest of the townhouses were.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=929.0)  |
|     931 |   932 | Next.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=931.0)  |
|     932 |   936 | And then the last example of a built project is a whole green field,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=932.0)  |
|     936 |   940 | a whole brand new project out of scratch or from scratch                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=936.0)  |
|     940 |   943 | in out of south of Lincoln, Nebraska.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=940.0)  |
|     943 |   949 | And this is 600 units, and it's about 60 percent built.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=943.0)  |
|     949 |   952 | And you could see the different buildings here,                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=949.0)  |
|     952 |   954 | brand new streets and everything.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=952.0)  |
|     954 |   957 | What's really interesting about this one is this is a former apartment developer,                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=954.0)  |
|     957 |   962 | somebody who used to build apartments like everybody else does.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=957.0)  |
|     962 |   969 | And one day he said, I want to build space that I can lease 100 percent,                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=962.0)  |
|     969 |   971 | and right now I'm building space that I can't lease everything,                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=969.0)  |
|     971 |   973 | lobbies, recreation rooms, all these things.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=971.0)  |
|     973 |   976 | I want to build completely leaseable space.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=973.0)  |
|     976 |   978 | And he said, I've seen these missing middle types,                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=976.0)  |
|     978 |   981 | and because they're walk-ups, they don't have corridors in them,                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=978.0)  |
|     981 |   984 | they don't have lobbies, I think I can do that.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=981.0)  |
|     984 |   986 | And so that's one of the things that attracted him to it.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=984.0)  |
|     986 |   990 | So this entire project is all those types that I showed you,                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=986.0)  |
|     990 |   995 | the small and medium ones, the duplex on up, there are no houses in it.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=990.0)  |
|     995 |   997 | It's all missing middle.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=995.0)  |
|     997 |   998 | Next.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=997.0)  |
|     998 |  1000 | So why is it needed?                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=998.0)  |
|    1000 |  1004 | Today, you know, just a quick three statistics here.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1000.0) |
|    1004 |  1009 | Thirty percent of American households are single-person households,                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1004.0) |
|    1009 |  1014 | and for Knoxville the number is 40 percent, according to the city.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1009.0) |
|    1015 |  1020 | And another important thing is in, what, seven more years,                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1015.0) |
|    1020 |  1024 | 20 percent of us will be 65, including me.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1020.0) |
|    1024 |  1027 | I'll be 65 in two years.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1024.0) |
|    1027 |  1032 | And then the other important thing is that the single-person household                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1027.0) |
|    1032 |  1037 | and just the smaller household demographic is increasing.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1032.0) |
|    1037 |  1040 | Across the country it's 75 percent at least.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1037.0) |
|    1040 |  1043 | In Knoxville, as of today, it's 78 percent.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1040.0) |
|    1043 |  1048 | So what we see is communities across the country are exploring other housing                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1043.0) |
|    1048 |  1052 | choices to deal with this growing trend.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1048.0) |
|    1052 |  1054 | So what can missing middle housing do?                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1052.0) |
|    1054 |  1057 | I'll just read these off and we can talk about them when we get into                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1054.0) |

|    1101 |  1104 | Maybe what are some best practices to be aware of?                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1101.0) |
|    1104 |  1108 | When we did the missing middle scan last fall,                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1104.0) |
|    1108 |  1112 | these are the main findings that we came away with.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1108.0) |
|    1112 |  1117 | And just in the interest of time, I'll tell you that the biggest,                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1112.0) |
|    1117 |  1123 | most repeating finding that we came upon in reading the area plans                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1117.0) |
|    1123 |  1127 | and reading the zoning is that the zoning doesn't have that many barriers.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1123.0) |
|    1127 |  1131 | There's some technical barriers here and there that can be addressed.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1127.0) |
|    1131 |  1134 | But the biggest one was the lack of clarity of where you mean big                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1131.0) |
|    1134 |  1137 | apartments and where you don't mean big apartments.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1134.0) |
|    1137 |  1141 | Multifamily is this big category across the country,                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1137.0) |
|    1141 |  1144 | and what we found is cities need a little more nuance than they                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1141.0) |

|    1148 |  1152 | I know the comp plan and the zoning says multifamily,                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1148.0) |
|    1152 |  1155 | but we didn't mean that big multifamily over there.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1152.0) |
|    1155 |  1157 | We meant it over here.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1155.0) |
|    1157 |  1161 | Cities don't currently have a lot of tools to articulate that.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1157.0) |
|    1161 |  1165 | And so that's what a lot of times we help cities with,                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1161.0) |
|    1165 |  1167 | is just to make them aware of that,                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1165.0) |

|    1176 |  1178 | Next.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1176.0) |
|    1178 |  1183 | So some barriers that we see across the country and best practices that                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1178.0) |

|    1186 |  1190 | with the idea of clarity about what you mean by multifamily.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1186.0) |

|    1201 |  1205 | They're both multifamily, but which one do you mean where?                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1201.0) |
|    1205 |  1209 | And that's super helpful for investor and neighbor alike.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1205.0) |

|    1211 |  1214 | As I mentioned this morning, density is, you know,                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1211.0) |
|    1214 |  1218 | this might sound weird to tell you, but it's not the conversation to have.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1214.0) |
|    1218 |  1223 | You know, in city after city, everybody's focused on density because                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1218.0) |
|    1223 |  1226 | that's what's in a lot of the regulations.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1223.0) |
|    1226 |  1228 | It's what's in a lot of policy.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1226.0) |
|    1228 |  1231 | So that's why we end up talking about it.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1228.0) |
|    1231 |  1234 | But if you look at the places that were built that you tend to like,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1231.0) |
|    1234 |  1236 | they weren't built by density.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1234.0) |
|    1236 |  1239 | They were built just by design, and the density is a result of that.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1236.0) |
|    1239 |  1243 | So as an example, here's a picture on the left of a three-story building,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1239.0) |
|    1243 |  1247 | longer than you can see in the photograph, with 49 units.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1243.0) |
|    1247 |  1249 | It measures 30 units to the acre.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1247.0) |
|    1249 |  1253 | The building on the right is a missing middle mansion apartment                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1249.0) |
|    1253 |  1255 | with five units in it.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1253.0) |
|    1255 |  1259 | It's a house scale, and it measures 29 to the acre.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1255.0) |
|    1259 |  1263 | So let's just take the example of your 24 to the acre maximum limit                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1259.0) |
|    1263 |  1269 | in your RN4 and RN3, I believe.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1263.0) |
|    1269 |  1271 | If somebody said, okay, we like missing middle,                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1269.0) |
|    1271 |  1275 | but we're going to cap everything at 24 to the acre, let's agree to that,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1271.0) |
|    1275 |  1279 | you would leave out the five plex on the side because it's 29 to the acre.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1275.0) |
|    1279 |  1283 | So what we recommend to people, to cities, is to say,                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1279.0) |
|    1283 |  1285 | don't regulate by density.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1283.0) |
|    1285 |  1288 | Regulate by form and by other standards.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1285.0) |
|    1288 |  1290 | And as long as somebody meets your standards,                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1288.0) |
|    1290 |  1294 | if somebody can fit four units in there or five and meet the standards,                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1290.0) |
|    1294 |  1295 | what's the difference?                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1294.0) |

|    1337 |  1341 | Often parking is simply ñ parking is a huge issue, don't get me wrong.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1337.0) |
|    1341 |  1345 | It is probably one of the toughest issues to solve because it's very                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1341.0) |

|    1349 |  1356 | So we just simply recommend that it be looked at on a sliding scale based                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1349.0) |

|    1415 |  1418 | And, again, that goes back to how zoning started.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1415.0) |
|    1418 |  1423 | Big pieces of property and wanting to keep buildings away from each                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1418.0) |
|    1423 |  1425 | other for a bunch of good reasons.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1423.0) |
|    1425 |  1428 | But when you talk about platted lots that already exist on existing                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1425.0) |
|    1428 |  1432 | blocks in the city, you really want to look at lot width,                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1428.0) |
|    1432 |  1434 | because that determines what can fit.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1432.0) |
|    1434 |  1436 | Lot area, somebody might comply with it,                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1434.0) |
|    1436 |  1440 | but it's usually freezing out development,                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1436.0) |
|    1440 |  1444 | because somebody might say, well, I can fit X on that lot.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1440.0) |
|    1444 |  1446 | Yeah, but you don't meet the lot area.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1444.0) |
|    1446 |  1448 | Well, then I can't do anything there.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1446.0) |
|    1448 |  1450 | But if you just regulate it by lot width,                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1448.0) |
|    1450 |  1454 | that has a lot more bearing on what you can do.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1450.0) |

|    1458 |  1461 | This seems like an arcane topic to talk about,                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1458.0) |
|    1461 |  1466 | especially to a city council, but you need to know that things as                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1461.0) |
|    1466 |  1469 | mundane as driveway widths can stop a project.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1466.0) |
|    1469 |  1474 | And it's not that the people with these standards mean to stop projects.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1469.0) |
|    1474 |  1479 | They have a certain mission, and their standards are in their documents,                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1474.0) |
|    1479 |  1481 | and they have to carry out their standards, right?                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1479.0) |
|    1482 |  1487 | And so a lot of times it goes unnoticed that a multifamily project has a                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1482.0) |
|    1487 |  1490 | requirement, let's say in this case, for a 20-foot driveway.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1487.0) |
|    1490 |  1494 | Well, if you apply that 20-foot driveway to the situation on the right,                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1490.0) |
|    1494 |  1496 | for those house-scale buildings, it's way too much.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1494.0) |
|    1496 |  1501 | It's probably half the lot, you know, or most of a 50-foot wide lot.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1496.0) |
|    1501 |  1506 | So you really want to scale requirements for missing middle projects                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1501.0) |
|    1506 |  1510 | as distinct from regular multifamily projects.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1506.0) |
|    1511 |  1517 | And then just being clear, if you mean to say we are looking for a                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1511.0) |

|    1706 |  1710 | And those are places to start with missing middle.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1706.0) |
|    1710 |  1714 | So last couple slides here about testing what you're thinking about.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1710.0) |
|    1714 |  1716 | Once you start working with a group,                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1714.0) |
|    1716 |  1719 | you start looking at the kinds of places where you might consider this                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1716.0) |
|    1719 |  1722 | and you want to test this, do some drawings,                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1719.0) |
|    1722 |  1727 | do some testing on actual parcels, talk it out, go ahead,                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1722.0) |
|    1728 |  1732 | and lay it out and talk to people and communicate and say,                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1728.0) |
|    1732 |  1735 | this is what we're talking about, this is not what we're talking about,                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1732.0) |
|    1735 |  1739 | how's this working, does it work financially, what kind of changes,                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1735.0) |
|    1739 |  1742 | if any, do we need to make to zoning, all those kinds of things.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1739.0) |
|    1742 |  1745 | They just pop up and you can address them.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1742.0) |
|    1745 |  1749 | And then the last slide here, you can put them all down on paper,                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1745.0) |
|    1749 |  1755 | share them, publicize them, educate and be educated by input from all                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1749.0) |
|    1755 |  1757 | kinds of people.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1755.0) |
|    1757 |  1759 | And then you can go forward.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1757.0) |
|    1759 |  1763 | Last slide here, you can go forward with a pilot project.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1759.0) |
|    1763 |  1768 | There's lots of ways to go, but maybe you'll make changes in your                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1763.0) |
|    1768 |  1772 | policies and your zoning and leave it to the investment community to do                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1768.0) |
|    1772 |  1777 | it, or you might partner with a community land trust or nonprofit and                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1772.0) |
|    1777 |  1782 | do a test pilot project to plant the seeds and to say, hey,                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1777.0) |
|    1782 |  1785 | this is what we're trying to do, we want you to join.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1782.0) |
|    1785 |  1787 | So that's the last slide.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1785.0) |
|    1787 |  1790 | I really thank you for your attention and I'm ready for your questions.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1787.0) |
|    1790 |  1791 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1790.0) |
|    1791 |  1792 | Thank you, Mr. Perez.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1791.0) |
|    1792 |  1794 | I did have a light on for Councilmember Ryder,                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1792.0) |
|    1794 |  1796 | so I'll call on her for a question.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1794.0) |
|    1796 |  1800 | Yeah, I just, when you kept saying change the standards,                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1796.0) |
|    1800 |  1803 | change the standards, I think you listed some of those,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1800.0) |
|    1803 |  1807 | but for the benefit of us and anyone listening,                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1803.0) |
|    1807 |  1811 | what exactly do you mean when you say modify your standards?                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1807.0) |
|    1812 |  1819 | Yeah, so in the scan, we found a couple of things that presented                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1812.0) |
|    1819 |  1822 | barriers to missing middle.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1819.0) |
|    1822 |  1825 | Not as a complete stopper of the project,                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1822.0) |
|    1825 |  1829 | but it would pose an obstacle in one way.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1825.0) |
|    1829 |  1836 | Things like minimum lot area or density, it's the same thing.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1829.0) |
|    1837 |  1842 | The parking, especially on smaller parcels, and again,                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1837.0) |
|    1842 |  1846 | I know parking is a super special issue.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1842.0) |
|    1846 |  1849 | And then there were a couple other minor standards,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1846.0) |
|    1849 |  1854 | but the two bigger ones were lot area density and parking.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1849.0) |
|    1854 |  1860 | And I think lot coverage in maybe one zone district.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1854.0) |
|    1860 |  1863 | But what I meant generally, the reason I didn't refer to them                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1860.0) |
|    1863 |  1868 | specifically is that depending on where you choose to try this,                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1863.0) |
|    1868 |  1870 | it may present issues that we didn't see,                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1868.0) |
|    1870 |  1872 | and so that's why I said it generically,                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1870.0) |
|    1872 |  1874 | just changing the standards.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1872.0) |
|    1874 |  1876 | So not saying change all standards,                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1874.0) |
|    1876 |  1879 | but changing the ones that are preventing the outcomes that you                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1876.0) |
|    1879 |  1881 | want to have.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1879.0) |
|    1881 |  1882 | Okay.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1881.0) |
|    1882 |  1883 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1882.0) |
|    1883 |  1885 | Yeah, you're welcome.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1883.0) |
|    1885 |  1889 | Councilmember Parker.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1885.0) |
|    1889 |  1895 | One thing that struck me about the presentation was the focus on density                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1889.0) |
|    1895 |  1897 | and parking.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1895.0) |
|    1897 |  1903 | And some of the concerns I've heard from residents and from other planning                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1897.0) |
|    1903 |  1911 | processes in other cities is when there's a disconnect between budgeted                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1903.0) |
|    1911 |  1917 | road improvements and plans to increase density in certain areas.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1911.0) |
|    1917 |  1926 | So to change the standards and not consider density during the planning                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1917.0) |
|    1926 |  1928 | process was a surprise to me.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1926.0) |
|    1928 |  1929 | Can you talk more about that?                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1928.0) |
|    1929 |  1930 | Yes, certainly.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1929.0) |
|    1930 |  1932 | So I want to be clear.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1930.0) |
|    1932 |  1934 | I'm not saying don't consider density.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1932.0) |
|    1934 |  1938 | I'm asking you to consider not regulating by density.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1934.0) |
|    1938 |  1941 | So when you would go through a planning process and look at the                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1938.0) |
|    1941 |  1944 | projections for infrastructure of all kinds,                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1941.0) |
|    1944 |  1948 | you certainly would consider the projected populations,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1944.0) |
|    1948 |  1952 | the projected needs, and if that translated into a density number.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1948.0) |
|    1952 |  1956 | I'm just simply saying once you've done that and you know the outcomes that                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1952.0) |
|    1956 |  1959 | you want, there's a way to get those outcomes without putting a density                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1956.0) |
|    1959 |  1961 | regulation in your standards.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1959.0) |
|    1961 |  1962 | Yeah.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1961.0) |
|    1962 |  1968 | Thank you for the question.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1962.0) |
|    1968 |  1970 | I would just ask, Mr. Perez, you know,                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1968.0) |
|    1970 |  1974 | one of the things I found interesting in the presentation was about,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1970.0) |
|    1974 |  1975 | you know,                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1974.0) |
|    1975 |  1979 | I guess how the scale and the fit in the neighborhood that you were able                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1975.0) |
|    1979 |  1985 | to, you know, accommodate, you know, this missing middle housing,                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1979.0) |
|    1985 |  1989 | but it also fits the same character as the homes around it.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1985.0) |
|    1989 |  1990 | Yeah.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1989.0) |
|    1990 |  1992 | So I found that quite interesting.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1990.0) |
|    1992 |  1996 | The one question I did have, though, with regard to the missing middle,                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1992.0) |
|    1997 |  2002 | you know, we definitely deal a lot with rental spaces right now,                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=1997.0) |
|    2002 |  2006 | and we need to have more space for, you know,                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2002.0) |
|    2006 |  2009 | people who are moving in here and also more affordable space.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2006.0) |
|    2009 |  2013 | And I would imagine that this can be more affordable.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2009.0) |
|    2013 |  2017 | But I also wanted to ask, is this also the missing middle?                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2013.0) |
|    2017 |  2022 | Is it something that you can own as well as something that is a rental?                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2017.0) |
|    2023 |  2027 | And the reason for that is just thinking about equity and the ability for,                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2023.0) |
|    2027 |  2029 | you know, folks who are owning, you know,                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2027.0) |
|    2029 |  2033 | a unit to be able to build up some equity over time.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2029.0) |
|    2033 |  2036 | Can you explore that with us?                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2033.0) |
|    2036 |  2038 | Yeah, certainly, Vice Mayor.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2036.0) |
|    2038 |  2043 | The missing middle can be rental or ownership.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2038.0) |
|    2043 |  2048 | The projects that I showed you, the majority of them are rental.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2043.0) |
|    2048 |  2051 | Some are exploring ownership.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2048.0) |
|    2051 |  2055 | And I say exploring because ownership is tougher if it's not a townhouse,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2051.0) |
|    2055 |  2058 | just because of the condominium requirements                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2055.0) |
|    2058 |  2062 | and all the legal requirements around condominium ownership.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2058.0) |
|    2062 |  2067 | And so that's another one of those obstacles that people don't realize.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2062.0) |
|    2067 |  2069 | Maybe this board does,                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2067.0) |
|    2069 |  2075 | but the general public doesn't necessarily realize that the ability for a                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2069.0) |
|    2075 |  2079 | condominium project to happen on a sixplex is,                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2075.0) |
|    2079 |  2085 | or the process is basically the same as for a giant 400-unit building.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2079.0) |
|    2085 |  2087 | And so, you know,                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2085.0) |
|    2087 |  2091 | just like multifamily is this big term that needs to be parsed out into four                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2087.0) |
|    2091 |  2095 | and five-story versions of multifamily and house scale versions,                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2091.0) |
|    2095 |  2101 | the same goes for the condo ownership requirements,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2095.0) |
|    2101 |  2104 | that they aren't parsed out the same way.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2101.0) |
|    2104 |  2107 | So it's a huge hurdle for a small builder to do.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2104.0) |
|    2107 |  2112 | And so you tend to see more rentals than ownership, but it is for both.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2107.0) |
|    2112 |  2113 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2112.0) |
|    2113 |  2114 | Yes.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2113.0) |
|    2114 |  2115 | Council Member Smith.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2114.0) |
|    2115 |  2116 | Thank you, Vice Mayor.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2115.0) |
|    2116 |  2118 | Thank you, Mr. Perez, for being here.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2116.0) |
|    2118 |  2124 | You mentioned the importance of not restricting use in this,                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2118.0) |
|    2124 |  2128 | and I think the South Waterfront Code is a good example of form-based code                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2124.0) |
|    2128 |  2130 | that allows for that.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2128.0) |
|    2130 |  2132 | I think it's meant for missing middle,                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2130.0) |
|    2132 |  2136 | and I think that's a good example, I think, in a lot of ways.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2132.0) |
|    2136 |  2139 | One of the things that I didn't see in here                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2136.0) |
|    2139 |  2144 | or here today was the importance of pedestrian infrastructure,                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2139.0) |
|    2144 |  2148 | particularly sidewalks, and also retail.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2144.0) |
|    2148 |  2153 | I think just a quick scan of the report, although it was very good,                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2148.0) |
|    2153 |  2155 | by the way, don't hear me criticizing,                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2153.0) |
|    2155 |  2157 | but there's 100 references to walkability                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2155.0) |
|    2157 |  2160 | and there's less than five references to sidewalks.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2157.0) |
|    2160 |  2164 | So I also didn't see any kind of retail in the presentation,                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2160.0) |
|    2164 |  2167 | which doesn't mean that's limited to today's presentation.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2164.0) |
|    2167 |  2170 | But one of the things that's unique to the South Waterfront                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2167.0) |
|    2170 |  2173 | and the form-based code is that I think it references                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2170.0) |
|    2173 |  2176 | park-once walkable centers.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2173.0) |
|    2176 |  2179 | Can you talk a little bit about the importance of that                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2176.0) |
|    2179 |  2182 | and, you know, public transportation important?                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2179.0) |
|    2182 |  2187 | I mentioned sidewalks, but the idea that you can take care of a lot of life's                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2182.0) |
|    2187 |  2192 | actions or at least a good bit of them without having to drive around.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2187.0) |
|    2192 |  2195 | If all we do is focus on the housing element of this,                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2192.0) |
|    2195 |  2200 | then we just create congestion with housed congestion.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2195.0) |
|    2200 |  2202 | And so talk a little bit about the retail                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2200.0) |
|    2202 |  2206 | and pedestrian infrastructure role in this.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2202.0) |
|    2206 |  2209 | Yeah, thank you for the question, Council Member.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2206.0) |
|    2209 |  2213 | Yeah, so I focused on the housing portion                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2209.0) |
|    2213 |  2219 | and just made reference to the amenities and the walkability that way.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2213.0) |
|    2219 |  2225 | But certainly we are assuming that in talking that way,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2219.0) |
|    2225 |  2230 | we are assuming that there's something to walk to other than more houses.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2225.0) |
|    2230 |  2233 | And that's why we use the term amenities,                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2230.0) |
|    2233 |  2236 | that there's shopping, food, services, and transit,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2233.0) |
|    2236 |  2240 | one or all four of those in any combination.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2236.0) |
|    2240 |  2246 | And that's where you want to gravitate around                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2240.0) |
|    2246 |  2249 | and focus initial efforts for missing middle housing                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2246.0) |
|    2249 |  2252 | because of all the reasons you just stated.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2249.0) |
|    2252 |  2259 | And that those areas, I made the assumption,                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2252.0) |
|    2259 |  2265 | I should be more explicit, that they are walkable because of the proximity                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2259.0) |
|    2265 |  2268 | of the units to all those services and amenities,                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2265.0) |
|    2268 |  2272 | but they're walkable also because it's fun to walk there                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2268.0) |
|    2272 |  2275 | and it's pleasant, it's good to walk there.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2272.0) |
|    2275 |  2276 | There are good sidewalks.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2275.0) |
|    2276 |  2279 | There's a lot of what you call pedestrian infrastructure                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2276.0) |
|    2279 |  2281 | or even bike infrastructure for that matter.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2279.0) |
|    2281 |  2284 | So, yeah, I apologize for not bringing that out.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2281.0) |
|    2284 |  2286 | But, yeah, it's a component of this.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2284.0) |
|    2286 |  2290 | And just to, I guess, underscore that point,                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2286.0) |
|    2290 |  2294 | the project I showed in Nebraska is from scratch.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2290.0) |
|    2294 |  2295 | There's nothing out there.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2294.0) |
|    2295 |  2298 | And the developer said, you know, I want to do this the right way,                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2295.0) |
|    2298 |  2300 | so I'm going to build the amenity.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2298.0) |
|    2300 |  2302 | I'm going to build a main street that doesn't exist                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2300.0) |
|    2302 |  2308 | so that I have that pedestrian amenity for people to walk to.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2302.0) |
|    2308 |  2310 | And it's interesting because his project,                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2308.0) |
|    2310 |  2312 | if you think of it as a rectangle,                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2310.0) |
|    2312 |  2316 | he put it over on the left-hand side, northwest part of it,                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2312.0) |
|    2316 |  2320 | because if you zoom out with all the other big projects that are happening,                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2316.0) |
|    2320 |  2323 | when it's all built, that's where the center                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2320.0) |
|    2323 |  2325 | that everybody's going to go to will be.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2323.0) |
|    2325 |  2327 | And so, yeah, great question.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2325.0) |
|    2327 |  2328 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2327.0) |
|    2328 |  2330 | To your credit, you mentioned Happy Holler,                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2328.0) |
|    2330 |  2332 | and I think that's a good example, I think, as well.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2330.0) |
|    2332 |  2334 | But I think those main street villages,                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2332.0) |
|    2334 |  2340 | I think part of the reason that missing middle works so well                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2334.0) |
|    2340 |  2343 | is because people are there every other day or every four days                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2340.0) |
|    2343 |  2347 | to transact for some reason as opposed to we restrict parking                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2343.0) |
|    2347 |  2350 | but encourage density.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2347.0) |
|    2350 |  2352 | You've got people just congested or not moving around.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2350.0) |
|    2352 |  2355 | So I think it's important for us, collectively,                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2352.0) |
|    2355 |  2361 | to remember that importance of the village retail plays a huge role                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2355.0) |
|    2361 |  2363 | in how this is even possible.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2361.0) |
|    2363 |  2368 | Yeah, and just to keep going with your point, Councilmember,                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2363.0) |
|    2368 |  2373 | there are in every community there are nodes, you know, these centers.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2368.0) |
|    2373 |  2376 | Like Happy Holler is one that you can tell it's really taken off.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2373.0) |
|    2376 |  2379 | But there are others in communities where you say,                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2376.0) |
|    2379 |  2382 | well, that one looks like it had some help or some investment.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2379.0) |
|    2382 |  2385 | That could be a revived center that doesn't.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2382.0) |
|    2385 |  2388 | It might even just be a crossroads, like two corners, you know,                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2385.0) |
|    2388 |  2390 | but it could serve that neighborhood.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2388.0) |
|    2390 |  2394 | And so it isn't always, and I'm not suggesting you are,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2390.0) |
|    2394 |  2398 | but just for clarity, it isn't always about the popular ones                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2394.0) |
|    2398 |  2400 | that are already out there.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2398.0) |
|    2400 |  2402 | It's about ones that used to exist.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2400.0) |
|    2402 |  2405 | I saw one in Lonsdale that looked like it could be revived                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2402.0) |
|    2405 |  2409 | with some investment, and it could be a nice, you know, two corners.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2405.0) |
|    2409 |  2412 | And then you could gravitate around that.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2409.0) |
|    2412 |  2413 | So, yeah, to your point.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2412.0) |
|    2413 |  2414 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2413.0) |
|    2414 |  2415 | Yep.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2414.0) |
|    2415 |  2416 | Councilmember Feagin.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2415.0) |
|    2416 |  2418 | Thank you, Vice Mayor.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2416.0) |
|    2418 |  2421 | One thing that you said that really struck a chord with me                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2418.0) |
|    2421 |  2424 | is defining multifamily,                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2421.0) |
|    2424 |  2431 | because we have multifamily housing all around                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2424.0) |
|    2431 |  2434 | in a lot of places that people just don't think about.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2431.0) |
|    2434 |  2437 | I mean, there's the little strip road that's got condos                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2434.0) |
|    2437 |  2440 | that touch side by side that are at a different price point.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2437.0) |
|    2440 |  2442 | You look out at North Shore Town Center,                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2440.0) |
|    2442 |  2445 | they have big houses, apartments.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2442.0) |
|    2445 |  2447 | They have all sorts of things.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2445.0) |
|    2447 |  2451 | So I do think getting people to acknowledge that a townhouse                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2447.0) |
|    2451 |  2456 | or the big old Victorian, you see them in Fort Sanders,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2451.0) |
|    2456 |  2458 | where they are apartments.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2456.0) |
|    2458 |  2463 | But your point about the financing is a huge issue.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2458.0) |
|    2463 |  2466 | The wealth can still be built if someone owns it,                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2463.0) |
|    2466 |  2469 | and then they buy the whole thing                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2466.0) |
|    2469 |  2471 | and then rent to help pay their mortgage.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2469.0) |
|    2471 |  2474 | You see, watch a lot of those home improvement shows,                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2471.0) |
|    2474 |  2476 | and they do that a lot in the big cities.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2474.0) |
|    2476 |  2481 | So it would be nice to have that opportunity here for citizens.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2476.0) |
|    2481 |  2482 | One question.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2481.0) |
|    2482 |  2485 | You talked about starting around Happy Holler.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2482.0) |
|    2485 |  2489 | It sounds to me like this could also be a great opportunity                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2485.0) |
|    2489 |  2494 | for infill housing in some of our small city lots,                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2489.0) |
|    2494 |  2498 | that that might be a nice way to build homes                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2494.0) |
|    2498 |  2501 | that matched the architecture,                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2498.0) |
|    2501 |  2504 | and that could be a good way to show communities                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2501.0) |

|    2509 |  2512 | Is that also a possibility of a way to start?                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2509.0) |
|    2512 |  2513 | Yeah, certainly.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2512.0) |

|    2519 |  2523 | I use Happy Holler as one of several potential examples.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2519.0) |
|    2523 |  2524 | Oh, I know.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2523.0) |
|    2524 |  2525 | I'm not criticizing that.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2524.0) |

|    2527 |  2530 | I just wanted to say that the way I said it earlier                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2527.0) |

|    2533 |  2536 | we should go to Happy Holler and get started.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2533.0) |
|    2536 |  2539 | I'm just suggesting that that is a really good example                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2536.0) |

|    2544 |  2547 | around which you could start Missing Middle,                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2544.0) |
|    2547 |  2550 | and there are several others in Knoxville                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2547.0) |
|    2550 |  2552 | that could qualify for that.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2550.0) |
|    2552 |  2554 | And I would just say we can do both.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2552.0) |
|    2554 |  2555 | Yeah.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2554.0) |
|    2555 |  2558 | I mean, there's nothing that says you can be real strategic                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2555.0) |

|    2559 |  2564 | but if there's some quick wins on some infill lots that look awful,                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2559.0) |
|    2564 |  2566 | that might be a good way to start.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2564.0) |
|    2567 |  2569 | Just along that point real quickly,                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2567.0) |
|    2569 |  2572 | I think one of the things, you know,                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2569.0) |
|    2572 |  2575 | that house scale portion of that, that one liner,                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2572.0) |

|    2578 |  2584 | house scale is critical because, as I've told other people today                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2578.0) |

|    2600 |  2601 | Let's go for four stories.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2600.0) |
|    2601 |  2603 | We can do it.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2601.0) |
|    2603 |  2604 | Or more.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2603.0) |
|    2604 |  2609 | We've had places in Australia say, yeah, we tried this,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2604.0) |
|    2609 |  2612 | and we went for six, six stories,                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2609.0) |
|    2612 |  2615 | and they're calling it Missing Middle,                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2612.0) |
|    2615 |  2617 | and they're trying to put it in neighborhoods.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2615.0) |
|    2617 |  2619 | I mean, who wants that in the neighborhood?                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2617.0) |
|    2619 |  2621 | And so the test has to be, A,                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2619.0) |
|    2621 |  2624 | can it fit on a lot that's already in a neighborhood?                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2621.0) |
|    2624 |  2627 | And, B, what you put on that lot,                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2624.0) |
|    2627 |  2630 | does it fit with the houses in the neighborhood?                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2627.0) |

|    2636 |  2639 | There was a guy in here from California that said we should start                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2636.0) |
|    2639 |  2644 | in Happy Holler, but one of the things he didn't talk about was,                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2639.0) |
|    2644 |  2651 | did you all look at our lighted property redevelopment processes at all?                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2644.0) |
|    2651 |  2652 | No.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2651.0) |
|    2652 |  2653 | Okay.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2652.0) |

|    2657 |  2658 | Okay.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2657.0) |
|    2658 |  2660 | That's the next chapter.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2658.0) |
|    2660 |  2661 | All right.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2660.0) |
|    2661 |  2663 | I think those are the questions we have at this point.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2661.0) |
|    2663 |  2666 | We can obviously call you back, Mr. Perez, but thank you so much.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2663.0) |
|    2666 |  2667 | Yes, thank you.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2666.0) |
|    2667 |  2670 | I want to welcome Deputy to the Mayor, Gil,                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2667.0) |
|    2670 |  2675 | who I think is going to lead us through some opportunities to support Missing Middle.                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2670.0) |
|    2675 |  2677 | Exactly, and I love the discussion so far,                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2675.0) |
|    2677 |  2681 | because I think hopefully you'll see some of those ideas reflected also in the analysis                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2677.0) |
|    2681 |  2683 | that our staff has already thought about.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2681.0) |
|    2683 |  2687 | So before we get started, in addition to thanking Tony and his team for being here,                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2683.0) |
|    2687 |  2690 | I also want to thank Council for inviting this workshop,                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2687.0) |
|    2690 |  2694 | because it gave us an opportunity to deepen our relationship with Opticoast,                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2690.0) |
|    2694 |  2696 | and we really appreciate that.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2694.0) |
|    2696 |  2698 | In making this workshop possible,                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2696.0) |
|    2698 |  2704 | I want to acknowledge that not only is the city supporting the travel for these two folks from Opticoast,                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2698.0) |
|    2704 |  2709 | but also we have support for that travel and their time here from the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2704.0) |
|    2709 |  2711 | and also Knox County Government.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2709.0) |
|    2711 |  2716 | So appreciating the fact that this is an interest that's not just limited to City Council or for the city,                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2711.0) |
|    2716 |  2722 | but something that we see an appetite for and a conversation starting elsewhere in the community.                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2716.0) |
|    2722 |  2725 | I also want to give a shout-out to our tech guru,                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2722.0) |
|    2725 |  2729 | but really the content guru on setting this up is Cheryl Ball.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2725.0) |
|    2729 |  2732 | You all know Cheryl, and she's really taken this on                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2729.0) |
|    2732 |  2735 | to make sure that this is a high-quality discussion for you today                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2732.0) |
|    2735 |  2740 | and has had some help from our Baker Center fellow, Om, who is here.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2735.0) |
|    2740 |  2742 | Wave, Om. Oh, did she just leave?                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2740.0) |
|    2742 |  2746 | Well, anyway, we've had some help from some of our Baker Center fellows.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2742.0) |
|    2746 |  2747 | I am going to lead the presentation,                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2746.0) |
|    2747 |  2750 | but I want to acknowledge that there are some folks here from other city teams                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2747.0) |
|    2750 |  2754 | and that this reflects a very collaborative discussion that we've had across departments.                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2750.0) |
|    2754 |  2757 | So in particular, as your questions deepen,                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2754.0) |
|    2757 |  2761 | we might tap some of the staff who are here from Plans Review and Inspections,                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2757.0) |
|    2761 |  2764 | from Housing and Neighborhood Development, from Law,                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2761.0) |
|    2764 |  2768 | and especially of the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Team.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2764.0) |
|    2768 |  2771 | They were really helpful in helping us think through this.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2768.0) |
|    2771 |  2775 | With that said, Tony really has laid a nice groundwork                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2771.0) |
|    2775 |  2779 | and I hope gives you a lot to think about as we go through this next section.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2775.0) |
|    2779 |  2782 | I want to emphasize that we do have a housing crisis                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2779.0) |
|    2782 |  2787 | and we are excited to join Council in really saying, let's tackle this.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2782.0) |
|    2787 |  2790 | It's a great thing because it reflects the high quality of life                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2787.0) |
|    2790 |  2794 | that our residents experience and that is drawing people to Knoxville.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2790.0) |
|    2794 |  2796 | So this is a reflection of, again, as the Mayor has said,                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2794.0) |
|    2796 |  2798 | it's a good problem to have, but it is a problem                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2796.0) |
|    2798 |  2802 | and we need to be very conscientious about thinking about strategies                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2798.0) |

|    2806 |  2808 | Just to give you a little bit of a statistic,                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2806.0) |
|    2808 |  2812 | and it may be one that you have perceived even if you haven't read,                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2808.0) |
|    2812 |  2816 | but from 1990 to 2005, so over a 15-year period,                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2812.0) |
|    2816 |  2821 | Knoxville grew by 1,800 residents total.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2816.0) |
|    2821 |  2825 | Since 2015, Knoxville has added 8,500                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2821.0) |
|    2825 |  2827 | and projections are in the next few years                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2825.0) |
|    2827 |  2832 | that we'll be adding 1,800 residents per year.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2827.0) |
|    2832 |  2835 | So you think about our growth curve as accelerating rapidly                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2832.0) |
|    2836 |  2838 | and if we don't prepare for that growth                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2836.0) |
|    2838 |  2841 | and if we are not innovative and forward-thinking                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2838.0) |
|    2841 |  2845 | and finding ways to build housing for the people who are coming to join us                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2841.0) |
|    2845 |  2847 | in this wonderful city that we live in,                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2845.0) |
|    2847 |  2850 | then we will risk a deepening affordability problem                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2847.0) |
|    2850 |  2854 | and price pressures and constraints for the people who live here now.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2850.0) |
|    2854 |  2858 | So all that said, I'm going to come back to my seat, I think,                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2854.0) |
|    2858 |  2863 | just to go through this, but Cheryl, thank you.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2858.0) |
|    2863 |  2866 | You've seen a little bit of this already from Tony,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2863.0) |
|    2866 |  2872 | but the OptiCoast study focused on four residential property zones in Knoxville                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2866.0) |
|    2872 |  2876 | and the good news is that we did see opportunity for missing middle housing                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2872.0) |
|    2876 |  2880 | in all of those zones in some form or fashion.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2876.0) |
|    2880 |  2885 | That said, we also know that there is opportunity to do more                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2880.0) |
|    2885 |  2888 | and that there were some barriers to missing middle.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2885.0) |
|    2888 |  2893 | So we see this as an example for the townhouse on the right photo.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2888.0) |
|    2893 |  2898 | We also see this in areas like Mechanicsville more recently.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2893.0) |
|    2898 |  2902 | So we see an opportunity to build on what has been successful                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2898.0) |
|    2902 |  2906 | and what folks might be familiar with in various places around their neighborhoods                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2902.0) |
|    2906 |  2909 | to provide a diversity of price options                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2906.0) |
|    2909 |  2912 | and hopefully greater opportunity for economic mobility,                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2909.0) |
|    2912 |  2916 | more housing for more types of families in more places.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2912.0) |
|    2919 |  2925 | The OptiCoast team really emphasized and appreciated the discussion around walkability                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2919.0) |
|    2925 |  2929 | because the best opportunities we have are where we have neighborhood-serving businesses                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2925.0) |
|    2929 |  2932 | within walking distance of housing, access to transit,                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2929.0) |
|    2932 |  2934 | and where there's already some density.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2932.0) |
|    2934 |  2937 | So we want to emphasize that these are not the only places                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2934.0) |
|    2937 |  2939 | that we can see missing middle housing be effective,                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2937.0) |
|    2939 |  2942 | but OptiCoast has identified some optimal opportunities                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2939.0) |
|    2942 |  2945 | and that's where we want to start.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2942.0) |
|    2945 |  2947 | I'll go through here quickly, but again,                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2945.0) |
|    2947 |  2952 | emphasizing that we think that missing middle is ripe for Knoxville                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2947.0) |
|    2952 |  2954 | because of some of these demographics                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2952.0) |
|    2954 |  2959 | and the opportunity not only to serve these emerging,                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2954.0) |
|    2959 |  2962 | aging households, houses without children,                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2959.0) |
|    2962 |  2966 | but also again do so in a way that really respects the form of neighborhoods                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2962.0) |
|    2966 |  2969 | and architecture that we have.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2966.0) |
|    2969 |  2972 | So we started this conversation with staff                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2969.0) |
|    2972 |  2976 | and we'd like to start it with you very much in a how might we type of conversation.                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2972.0) |
|    2976 |  2979 | So very much around where are the brainstorm points,                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2976.0) |
|    2979 |  2983 | where we see pathways, where we see potential,                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2979.0) |
|    2983 |  2985 | but again we want to open this conversation with you.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2983.0) |
|    2985 |  2988 | So what we're not doing today is bringing you any specific proposals.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2985.0) |
|    2988 |  2991 | We're really here to bring you some of the ideas that we've had                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2988.0) |
|    2991 |  2995 | and start a conversation about how we might move those ideas forward                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2991.0) |
|    2995 |  2998 | and hear your reaction to them, maybe get your ideas as well.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2995.0) |
|    2999 |  3002 | We've identified a few possible pathways and we'll go through them,                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=2999.0) |
|    3002 |  3007 | but we see some natural opportunities to embed missing middle housing principles                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3002.0) |
|    3007 |  3009 | into some of our existing processes,                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3007.0) |
|    3009 |  3011 | and some of those have already been alluded to.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3009.0) |
|    3011 |  3017 | We also see an opportunity to make some very targeted zoning tweaks                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3011.0) |
|    3017 |  3019 | in specific geographic areas.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3017.0) |
|    3019 |  3023 | Again, to Tony's point, we don't think it's viable to start citywide                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3019.0) |
|    3023 |  3026 | and we don't think that that's pragmatic based on the best practice from other cities.                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3023.0) |
|    3027 |  3031 | So how do we think about making very specific tweaks in targeted zones                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3027.0) |
|    3031 |  3034 | where we think missing middle housing can be most appropriate?                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3031.0) |
|    3034 |  3038 | We also want to look at how we can use tools in our incentive toolbox                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3034.0) |
|    3038 |  3042 | to strategically encourage, and to your point, Councilwoman Fugate,                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3038.0) |
|    3042 |  3044 | maybe actually create some of these spaces                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3042.0) |
|    3044 |  3047 | through some targeted investments in targeted locations.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3044.0) |
|    3050 |  3053 | So let's start with some of the things that we already have in place                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3050.0) |
|    3053 |  3057 | that we think we can build missing middle housing into.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3053.0) |
|    3058 |  3061 | The first is our one-year plan,                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3058.0) |
|    3061 |  3064 | where we see an opportunity to set the stage at the high level                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3061.0) |
|    3064 |  3067 | for these types of housing opportunities                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3064.0) |
|    3067 |  3072 | to provide that clarity around what is house-scale missing middle                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3067.0) |
|    3072 |  3078 | versus some of the larger multifamily conversations.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3072.0) |
|    3078 |  3080 | So setting the stage at the high level.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3078.0) |
|    3081 |  3086 | We also know that location criteria can be a barrier to a place for missing middle.                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3081.0) |
|    3086 |  3087 | Housing really makes sense.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3086.0) |
|    3087 |  3093 | So we're also very interested in looking at how the land use classification table                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3087.0) |
|    3093 |  3096 | could be updated to reflect these principles.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3093.0) |
|    3097 |  3101 | And again, we want to make sure that these changes align with our zoning code.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3097.0) |
|    3101 |  3106 | Many of you went through recode and we want to build on that effort, not redo it.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3101.0) |
|    3107 |  3110 | This has been alluded to, so thank you, Councilwoman Smith.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3107.0) |
|    3110 |  3113 | But we also think that there's an opportunity to look at the guidelines                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3110.0) |
|    3113 |  3116 | and the principles that guide the operations of our blighted property                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3113.0) |
|    3116 |  3120 | and homemakers programs and think about ways that we can be more specific                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3116.0) |
|    3120 |  3123 | in acknowledging the opportunity for missing middle                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3120.0) |
|    3123 |  3126 | as a result of those programs that we already have in place.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3123.0) |
|    3129 |  3131 | So let's think about zoning.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3129.0) |
|    3131 |  3135 | And again, really trying to emphasize the importance of zoning                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3131.0) |
|    3135 |  3138 | and to emphasize here that as we consider this,                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3135.0) |
|    3138 |  3141 | we're really thinking about where does it make the most sense                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3138.0) |
|    3141 |  3144 | and what are the changes that can get us the benefit we're looking for                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3141.0) |
|    3144 |  3150 | while not being so broad that we have the long protracted conversation                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3144.0) |
|    3150 |  3153 | that many of us were part of when we did recode.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3150.0) |
|    3155 |  3158 | As I mentioned earlier and as you've heard a little bit,                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3155.0) |
|    3158 |  3163 | we do have opportunities for missing middle throughout our code already.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3158.0) |
|    3163 |  3166 | So we want to acknowledge that we have some residential zones                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3163.0) |
|    3166 |  3170 | that currently allow some types of missing middle housing, and that's great.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3166.0) |
|    3170 |  3174 | We also, as we looked into this, really recognized the opportunity                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3170.0) |
|    3174 |  3177 | that exists perhaps within the infill housing overlay.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3174.0) |
|    3177 |  3180 | This is an area, to mention Happy Holler, that really aligns well                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3177.0) |
|    3180 |  3186 | with some of those walkable close to transit and existing density.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3180.0) |
|    3186 |  3190 | So we thought that that was another really good tool that we could build from.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3186.0) |
|    3190 |  3193 | And then we also, as you alluded to, Councilman Smith, too,                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3190.0) |
|    3193 |  3197 | the South Waterfront Code is a form-based code that allows missing middle,                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3193.0) |
|    3197 |  3201 | and we've seen some great examples of how that can shape in a way                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3197.0) |
|    3201 |  3205 | that really does add some architectural interest to neighborhoods.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3201.0) |
|    3205 |  3210 | So we have some, again, we're starting from a place of, I think,                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3205.0) |
|    3210 |  3212 | some experience and some strength here.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3210.0) |
|    3212 |  3216 | I also want to acknowledge council in taking a big step                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3212.0) |
|    3216 |  3219 | to allow ADUs in our residential zones.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3216.0) |
|    3219 |  3222 | And so, again, this is a type and a place where we've seen                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3219.0) |
|    3222 |  3224 | some additional housing opportunity emerge.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3222.0) |
|    3224 |  3228 | So I want to thank council for being willing to explore that opportunity,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3224.0) |
|    3228 |  3232 | and we're seeing that emerge now as more people see an ADU,                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3228.0) |
|    3232 |  3236 | an accessory dwelling unit, as something that can advance their improvement                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3232.0) |
|    3236 |  3238 | in their property and create a new housing,                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3236.0) |
|    3238 |  3243 | whether for their family or for a renter.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3238.0) |
|    3243 |  3245 | I'll just go really quickly.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3243.0) |
|    3245 |  3248 | You'll see some modern examples as well as historic examples                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3245.0) |
|    3248 |  3251 | just to kind of give you some flavor for what's locally around already.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3248.0) |
|    3251 |  3253 | And as you mentioned, these exist.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3251.0) |
|    3253 |  3254 | You've probably seen them.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3253.0) |
|    3254 |  3256 | So we've got townhouses.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3254.0) |
|    3256 |  3260 | We've got historic side-by-side duplexes.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3256.0) |
|    3260 |  3262 | Here's another one in other neighborhoods.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3260.0) |
|    3262 |  3265 | We've got a multiplex on Morgan Street that's kind of interesting,                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3262.0) |
|    3265 |  3267 | maybe sort of that mid-scale.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3265.0) |
|    3267 |  3271 | So these exist, and it's exciting to see when you start looking for them                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3267.0) |
|    3271 |  3276 | just how many there are tucked into our neighborhoods.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3271.0) |
|    3276 |  3278 | So you've seen this chart, and it's in the report,                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3276.0) |
|    3278 |  3280 | so we're not going to go through it.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3278.0) |
|    3280 |  3283 | But we want to recognize that some of these barriers                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3280.0) |
|    3283 |  3286 | are probably harder to overcome than others,                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3283.0) |
|    3286 |  3289 | and so we're inclined to start with some of the easier ones.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3286.0) |
|    3289 |  3290 | We hope you are too.                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3289.0) |
|    3290 |  3292 | But really thinking about how can we make those tweaks                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3290.0) |
|    3292 |  3296 | where we unlock market potential in ways that are very pragmatic                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3292.0) |
|    3296 |  3299 | and very specific.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3296.0) |
|    3299 |  3301 | So where do we start?                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3299.0) |
|    3301 |  3303 | And we'll talk a little bit about this,                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3301.0) |
|    3303 |  3308 | but especially where do we start from that geographic perspective?                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3303.0) |
|    3308 |  3312 | The infill housing overlay guidelines need to be updated.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3308.0) |
|    3312 |  3315 | They haven't been since 2003 and 2007                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3312.0) |
|    3315 |  3317 | were the last times that we made tweaks.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3315.0) |
|    3317 |  3320 | So we think we need to do that anyway, no matter what,                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3317.0) |
|    3320 |  3323 | especially given the changes that we undertook with recode.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3320.0) |
|    3323 |  3325 | So as we're doing this, we really want to say,                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3323.0) |
|    3325 |  3327 | how do we make sure that we're being inclusive                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3325.0) |
|    3327 |  3330 | of the missing middle housing concept?                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3327.0) |
|    3330 |  3333 | So for example, the overlay really speaks predominantly                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3330.0) |
|    3333 |  3335 | to single family right now.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3333.0) |
|    3335 |  3338 | It mentions multifamily, but again, doesn't necessarily provide                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3335.0) |
|    3338 |  3341 | that clarity that Tony alluded to as being so important                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3338.0) |
|    3341 |  3345 | for that house scale opportunity for multifamily.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3341.0) |
|    3345 |  3349 | And again, it'll be important to ensure that those design guidelines                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3345.0) |
|    3349 |  3354 | continue to align with the current zoning guidelines.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3349.0) |
|    3354 |  3357 | As we do that, again, we want to think about the small adjustments                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3354.0) |
|    3357 |  3360 | that we can make within that housing overlay.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3357.0) |
|    3360 |  3363 | And if zoning adjustments are needed, applying them, again,                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3360.0) |
|    3363 |  3366 | first to that very pragmatic geographic zone,                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3363.0) |
|    3366 |  3369 | we could think about, again, OptiCoast goes into more detail on this,                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3366.0) |
|    3369 |  3373 | how tweaks to things like density setbacks, the lot area minimum,                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3369.0) |
|    3373 |  3376 | the lot width, again, trying to avoid those barriers                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3373.0) |
|    3376 |  3380 | that Tony presented in the first part of the workshop.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3376.0) |
|    3380 |  3383 | So I know at least two of you are probably very familiar                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3380.0) |
|    3383 |  3386 | with where the infill housing overlay exists.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3383.0) |
|    3386 |  3388 | Councilman Thomas and Councilwoman Ryder,                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3386.0) |
|    3388 |  3392 | it pretty much falls exclusively into your districts.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3388.0) |
|    3392 |  3395 | But it is located in these three areas.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3392.0) |
|    3395 |  3399 | So that's the Edgewood Park neighborhood, which I know well,                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3395.0) |
|    3399 |  3402 | the Oakwood Lincoln Park neighborhood, and Lonsdale.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3399.0) |
|    3402 |  3408 | So again, you think about where that Happy Holler North Central piece is,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3402.0) |
|    3408 |  3411 | and it's right in that, but it goes well beyond there                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3408.0) |
|    3411 |  3415 | to think about some of these other infill housing areas.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3411.0) |
|    3416 |  3418 | We think that this is a natural place to start,                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3416.0) |
|    3418 |  3423 | but to contextualize, we want to underscore that the infill housing overlay                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3418.0) |
|    3423 |  3430 | only covers just over 3.5% of our city's RN zones.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3423.0) |
|    3430 |  3434 | When you break that down in terms of what zones are within the overlay,                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3430.0) |
|    3434 |  3437 | just again, some data here to help orient you,                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3434.0) |
|    3437 |  3441 | the vast, vast majority of it is RN2.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3437.0) |
|    3441 |  3445 | Almost 90% of the land within the overlay is RN2,                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3441.0) |
|    3445 |  3450 | but again, that overlay is only just over 3.5% of the city as a whole.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3445.0) |
|    3450 |  3453 | So again, we are very excited about the opportunity                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3450.0) |
|    3453 |  3456 | to use infill housing as a starting point,                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3453.0) |
|    3456 |  3460 | but I offer that as you reflect on tonight,                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3456.0) |

|    3463 |  3466 | discuss this with folks in your districts, your constituents,                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3463.0) |
|    3466 |  3469 | we really want your feedback about how we might look beyond                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3466.0) |
|    3469 |  3472 | the infill housing overlay as it exists today                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3469.0) |
|    3472 |  3476 | to determine if there are other areas, other geographic lines                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3472.0) |
|    3476 |  3479 | that we could consider drawing or tools that we might use                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3476.0) |
|    3479 |  3482 | to focus our efforts on where it most makes sense,                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3479.0) |
|    3482 |  3486 | but at the same time not be only constrained to that 3.5%                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3482.0) |
|    3486 |  3489 | of the land that exists within the overlay now.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3486.0) |
|    3489 |  3492 | So again, reflect on that tonight or elsewhere,                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3489.0) |
|    3492 |  3494 | but we want to continue this conversation with you                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3492.0) |
|    3494 |  3498 | as we think about what those appropriate areas could be.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3494.0) |
|    3499 |  3501 | And then I'll end here kind of on the incentives                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3499.0) |
|    3501 |  3505 | and how we are able to encourage missing middle housing                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3501.0) |
|    3505 |  3507 | with some tools that we use.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3505.0) |
|    3507 |  3510 | So the great news is that we think that missing middle housing                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3507.0) |
|    3510 |  3513 | aligns really well with our development priorities                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3510.0) |
|    3513 |  3517 | and are great candidates for the city's public-private partnership programs                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3513.0) |
|    3517 |  3520 | that we brought several to council already for.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3517.0) |
|    3520 |  3522 | So again, these are on our website.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3520.0) |
|    3522 |  3525 | I won't go over them here, but there's a lot of alignment                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3522.0) |
|    3525 |  3528 | when we think about infill, when we think about interesting architecture.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3525.0) |
|    3528 |  3534 | So we're excited to see hopefully more opportunity for pilots                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3528.0) |
|    3534 |  3537 | and some of our other development incentive tools                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3534.0) |
|    3537 |  3541 | to support these types of smaller-scale and medium-scale housing.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3537.0) |
|    3541 |  3544 | And I'll also mention here that, you know, as council knows,                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3541.0) |
|    3544 |  3548 | we've been really successful at using this public-private partnership process                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3544.0) |
|    3548 |  3551 | to negotiate with the recipients of those incentives                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3548.0) |
|    3551 |  3555 | to include workforce- and income-based affordable housing,                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3551.0) |
|    3555 |  3557 | even at those smaller scales.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3555.0) |
|    3557 |  3560 | So again, this is an opportunity to link both the conversations                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3557.0) |
|    3560 |  3564 | around housing supply, but also one directly with affordability.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3560.0) |
|    3566 |  3569 | Again, going to ideas we've already talked a little bit about tonight,                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3566.0) |
|    3569 |  3572 | but we also are excited to think about showcase projects.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3569.0) |
|    3572 |  3575 | So where are there opportunities for partnerships                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3572.0) |
|    3575 |  3578 | where we can really highlight success stories,                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3575.0) |
|    3578 |  3583 | utilizing tools that exist within the Affordable Housing Fund, for example,                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3578.0) |
|    3583 |  3587 | and within our existing or new housing and neighborhood development programs?                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3583.0) |
|    3587 |  3590 | And again, the city owns a lot of land,                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3587.0) |
|    3590 |  3592 | some of which is already in the Homemakers Program,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3590.0) |
|    3592 |  3594 | some of which is in partnership with KCDC.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3592.0) |
|    3594 |  3596 | So we want to look at those opportunities                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3594.0) |
|    3596 |  3599 | to use our own properties that we have                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3596.0) |
|    3599 |  3601 | to how do we return them to the tax rolls                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3599.0) |
|    3601 |  3605 | in a way that also showcases the opportunity for this type of housing.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3601.0) |
|    3606 |  3609 | And the last one we'll go into is an intriguing best practice                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3606.0) |
|    3609 |  3613 | that harpens back to those Sears catalog days                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3609.0) |
|    3613 |  3615 | where you could order your house.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3613.0) |
|    3615 |  3617 | And more and more cities are using this,                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3615.0) |
|    3617 |  3621 | and it's one that we're really interested in exploring for Knoxville.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3617.0) |
|    3621 |  3625 | And that's where you can create a catalog of context-appropriate designs.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3621.0) |
|    3625 |  3629 | Sometimes you can pre-approve those designs to help streamline the process,                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3625.0) |
|    3629 |  3632 | but you allow easier access to small-scale developers                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3629.0) |
|    3632 |  3635 | who might be interested in building missing middle housing.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3632.0) |
|    3635 |  3637 | We want these to be easily replicated,                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3635.0) |
|    3637 |  3640 | but also easily tweaked to fit the site                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3637.0) |
|    3640 |  3643 | and something that can be repeated block after block                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3640.0) |
|    3643 |  3645 | and have enough diversity that you don't get tired                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3643.0) |
|    3645 |  3647 | of seeing the same house over and over again.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3645.0) |
|    3647 |  3649 | So it's the modern equivalent of those templates                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3647.0) |
|    3649 |  3654 | that can avoid the cost, perhaps, of an expensive architect on every project.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3649.0) |
|    3654 |  3657 | And we also want to have that high-quality design                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3654.0) |
|    3657 |  3660 | with respect for the historic character of different neighborhoods.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3657.0) |
|    3661 |  3663 | So the benefits here in terms of what makes that an incentive,                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3661.0) |
|    3663 |  3666 | one is that in other cities it's been shown to help reduce                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3663.0) |
|    3666 |  3669 | the architectural fees associated with those schematics                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3666.0) |
|    3669 |  3671 | and the construction documents.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3669.0) |
|    3671 |  3673 | That helps streamline the approvals.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3671.0) |
|    3673 |  3675 | Our teams can be familiar with those                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3673.0) |
|    3675 |  3680 | and be assured that they've had some of that design integrity                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3675.0) |
|    3680 |  3681 | built in from the beginning.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3680.0) |
|    3681 |  3682 | That helps.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3681.0) |
|    3682 |  3685 | And then it also creates potential for pre-approvals in certain areas                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3682.0) |
|    3685 |  3689 | or to help otherwise fast-track folks through a process.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3685.0) |
|    3689 |  3694 | And you could think about that in the context of infill housing, for example,                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3689.0) |
|    3694 |  3697 | if something's already been through design review board                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3694.0) |
|    3697 |  3699 | through a template process,                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3697.0) |
|    3699 |  3701 | and that streamlines the process on the back end                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3699.0) |
|    3701 |  3703 | for someone who chooses to utilize that template.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3701.0) |
|    3703 |  3706 | It's interesting when we looked at this                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3703.0) |
|    3706 |  3708 | and we realized that we had something kind of similar,                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3706.0) |
|    3708 |  3709 | although not quite,                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3708.0) |
|    3709 |  3713 | when KCDC developed Mechanicsville Commons.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3709.0) |
|    3713 |  3717 | So that was, again, a place that was all built through KCDC,                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3713.0) |
|    3717 |  3721 | but it had a set of plans for those visually attractive duplexes.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3717.0) |
|    3721 |  3724 | The design guidelines were very contextually appropriate.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3721.0) |
|    3724 |  3727 | It was moderate density, and it was a collaboration.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3724.0) |
|    3727 |  3729 | So it's not exactly what we're talking about                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3727.0) |
|    3729 |  3733 | because it was a unique public housing-driven project through KCDC,                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3729.0) |
|    3733 |  3736 | but it was, I think, a 47-page book                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3733.0) |
|    3736 |  3740 | with 24 different styles of pre-approved plans.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3736.0) |
|    3740 |  3743 | And so we could think about how to bring or use that as a model                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3740.0) |
|    3743 |  3747 | and bring similar types of catalogs for missing middle.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3743.0) |
|    3747 |  3751 | You can see some of the examples there of how that has helped streamline.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3747.0) |
|    3751 |  3753 | And if you drive through Mechanicsville,                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3751.0) |
|    3753 |  3757 | I think you'll see the familiarity with this type of look and aesthetic.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3753.0) |
|    3757 |  3760 | There's also a great case study                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3757.0) |
|    3760 |  3765 | that's been written about on a few kind of planning,                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3760.0) |

|    3792 |  3795 | but also really supported smaller developers                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3792.0) |

|    3807 |  3810 | is that in doing this, they went further to create even a support network                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3807.0) |

|    3817 |  3820 | where they would need additional approvals                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3817.0) |
|    3820 |  3823 | and in what circumstances how to navigate situations                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3820.0) |
|    3823 |  3826 | that are a little more unique because they do always come up,                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3823.0) |

|    3828 |  3831 | So really thinking about this as a wraparound opportunity                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3828.0) |
|    3831 |  3834 | to support a smaller and medium-scale developer community                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3831.0) |
|    3834 |  3837 | who may not be as, you know, experienced                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3834.0) |
|    3837 |  3840 | in navigating some of the systems,                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3837.0) |
|    3840 |  3843 | especially in a new context like missing middle.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3840.0) |
|    3843 |  3846 | So again, recognizing that there's a historic precedent                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3843.0) |
|    3846 |  3848 | for this type of approach                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3846.0) |
|    3848 |  3851 | and that we have some cities that we can learn from                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3848.0) |
|    3851 |  3854 | in pursuing this type of opportunity.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3851.0) |
|    3854 |  3856 | Again, this is an example.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3854.0) |
|    3856 |  3858 | This is still from the South Bend,                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3856.0) |
|    3858 |  3860 | but you think about where in a neighborhood                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3858.0) |
|    3860 |  3862 | where you might have several vacant lots,                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3860.0) |
|    3862 |  3864 | where you could utilize this catalog approach                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3862.0) |
|    3864 |  3867 | to promote a consistency                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3864.0) |
|    3867 |  3870 | while also helping more folks access the opportunity                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3867.0) |
|    3870 |  3872 | to infill those properties                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3870.0) |
|    3872 |  3875 | and turn them back into housing                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3872.0) |
|    3875 |  3879 | versus a vacant lot or a single-unit home,                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3875.0) |
|    3879 |  3882 | but rather something that allows additional housing opportunity there.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3879.0) |
|    3882 |  3885 | So the idea is to create opportunity to fill the gaps                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3882.0) |
|    3885 |  3889 | while gently increasing the density where you can.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3885.0) |
|    3889 |  3892 | And that's just a couple of examples                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3889.0) |
|    3892 |  3895 | from some of the smaller apartment buildings.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3892.0) |
|    3895 |  3897 | So I'll end here                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3895.0) |
|    3897 |  3900 | and would love to have some additional questions and discussion,                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3897.0) |
|    3900 |  3903 | but I want to emphasize that the stage that we're in                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3900.0) |
|    3903 |  3906 | with this conversation is very much around education,                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3903.0) |
|    3906 |  3908 | engagement, and evaluation.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3906.0) |
|    3908 |  3910 | So we're in this early stage                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3908.0) |

|    3914 |  3917 | hear reflections from both you and the constituents that we serve,                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3914.0) |
|    3917 |  3920 | and then also continue to evaluate more specific proposals,                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3917.0) |
|    3920 |  3923 | whether through our existing programs that we run in our departments                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3920.0) |
|    3923 |  3925 | but also through potential policy tweaks                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3923.0) |

|    3927 |  3929 | that we would need to undertake with Council.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3927.0) |
|    3929 |  3931 | So I'll stop there,                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3929.0) |

|    3933 |  3935 | to have additional questions and discussion.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3933.0) |

|    3936 |  3937 | Council Member Ryder.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3936.0) |
|    3937 |  3938 | Yeah.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3937.0) |
|    3938 |  3941 | So, Ms. Gill, and I want to throw this out here                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3938.0) |
|    3941 |  3944 | because I think what I heard you say was infill housing                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3941.0) |
|    3944 |  3947 | is one criteria that we could maybe examine                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3944.0) |
|    3947 |  3950 | to attach some potential changes to                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3947.0) |
|    3950 |  3954 | to restrict it to particular geographic areas.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3950.0) |
|    3954 |  3957 | And I know you and I had a conversation about that,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3954.0) |
|    3957 |  3959 | so I want to throw out food for thought for my colleagues                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3957.0) |
|    3959 |  3961 | to go home and sleep on                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3959.0) |
|    3961 |  3964 | and think more about in further examination                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3961.0) |
|    3964 |  3966 | after we talked about that.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3964.0) |
|    3966 |  3968 | That is way too restrictive.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3966.0) |
|    3968 |  3972 | So things that I've been mulling over would be                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3968.0) |
|    3974 |  3977 | anything on the ward maps,                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3974.0) |
|    3977 |  3979 | although I want those to go in the garbage,                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3977.0) |
|    3979 |  3981 | so I guess I should strike that comment,                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3979.0) |

|    3988 |  3991 | but, again, still minute piece of the pie.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3988.0) |
|    3992 |  3994 | I wonder if we could potentially approach it                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=3992.0) |

|    4032 |  4037 | and grid-like formatting from the 1800s and early 1900s                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4032.0) |
|    4037 |  4039 | and just doesn't meet that criteria.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4037.0) |
|    4039 |  4042 | Park Ridge is a great example of that.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4039.0) |
|    4042 |  4045 | It has a small piece of its pie that has an H1 overlay,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4042.0) |
|    4045 |  4048 | and then the rest of it's got nothing.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4045.0) |
|    4048 |  4052 | And so I know some folks over there, you know,                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4048.0) |
|    4052 |  4054 | want to be able to do some of this stuff,                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4052.0) |
|    4054 |  4056 | and that would eliminate them,                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4054.0) |
|    4056 |  4060 | and they would be very unhappy, as they've informed me.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4056.0) |
|    4060 |  4065 | So the other thing that I would like to ask our guest from Opticos,                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4060.0) |
|    4065 |  4067 | I'm going to switch gears a little bit.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4065.0) |
|    4067 |  4070 | You talked about defining multifamily,                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4067.0) |
|    4070 |  4072 | and I looked at our code,                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4070.0) |
|    4072 |  4074 | and we don't do a really good job of defining multifamily.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4072.0) |
|    4075 |  4078 | So talk a little bit about what you mean by defining.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4075.0) |
|    4078 |  4082 | Do you mean not by density, but help me understand.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4078.0) |
|    4082 |  4085 | Yeah, thank you for the question, Council Member.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4082.0) |
|    4085 |  4088 | You know, as I was showing with the pictures,                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4085.0) |
|    4088 |  4091 | both of those are multifamily.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4088.0) |
|    4091 |  4095 | And so what I mean by defining is to say                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4091.0) |
|    4095 |  4100 | you could simply define it by saying what missing middle is                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4095.0) |
|    4100 |  4102 | and then letting the rest of multifamily                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4100.0) |
|    4102 |  4104 | be currently as you know it.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4102.0) |
|    4104 |  4106 | Or you could try to define it,                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4104.0) |
|    4106 |  4110 | but it would probably be more effective to simply just say,                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4106.0) |
|    4110 |  4112 | multifamily is this big category.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4110.0) |
|    4112 |  4114 | Right now we're just trying to define missing middle                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4112.0) |
|    4114 |  4117 | so it isn't lumped in with the whole category.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4114.0) |
|    4117 |  4119 | And then you could just define missing middle                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4117.0) |
|    4119 |  4121 | in the ways that we're describing                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4119.0) |
|    4121 |  4123 | and the way we recommended in the scan.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4121.0) |
|    4123 |  4127 | Okay, so do we not define multifamily housing or things                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4123.0) |
|    4127 |  4130 | by like height, mass, fate, shape, form?                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4127.0) |
|    4130 |  4133 | Yeah, you do, but you can.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4130.0) |
|    4133 |  4138 | It's just that in order to not foreclose on possibilities,                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4133.0) |
|    4138 |  4140 | you're going to end up defining it                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4138.0) |
|    4140 |  4142 | as the maximum that it could be.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4140.0) |
|    4142 |  4146 | So, for example, if the max multifamily building                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4142.0) |
|    4146 |  4148 | you could have is a five-story building,                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4146.0) |
|    4148 |  4151 | you're going to say multifamily can be up to five stories tall                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4148.0) |
|    4151 |  4159 | and it's going to be, you could define it like that.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4151.0) |
|    4159 |  4165 | It'll be difficult to attach enough descriptive terms to it                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4159.0) |
|    4165 |  4169 | without cinching people into a certain outcome                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4165.0) |
|    4169 |  4172 | because there's so many varieties of multifamily housing                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4169.0) |
|    4172 |  4174 | after missing middle.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4172.0) |
|    4174 |  4177 | Okay, so I'm going to ask this last question                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4174.0) |
|    4177 |  4179 | and I'll turn myself off for a moment.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4177.0) |
|    4179 |  4183 | We don't define things in our code by number of stories.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4179.0) |
|    4183 |  4185 | We define things by height limit.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4183.0) |
|    4185 |  4190 | I believe 25, 35, 40, 45, I can't remember the exact numbers.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4185.0) |
|    4190 |  4194 | So is that not how other cities, is that not optimal?                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4190.0) |
|    4194 |  4196 | Is that not what you've seen in other cities?                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4194.0) |
|    4196 |  4200 | So multifamily is defined all over the map.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4196.0) |
|    4200 |  4204 | There's a wide variety of solutions                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4200.0) |
|    4204 |  4206 | of how people or cities define it.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4204.0) |
|    4207 |  4210 | That's why I'm suggesting that multifamily,                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4207.0) |
|    4210 |  4213 | that you only really define missing middle housing                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4210.0) |
|    4213 |  4216 | and let multifamily just rely on the standards                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4213.0) |
|    4216 |  4219 | and everything else because there's so many different varieties                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4216.0) |

|    4221 |  4226 | it'll be difficult to arrive at a definition                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4221.0) |

|    4228 |  4232 | Okay, so just for clarity, in our code we define                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4228.0) |

|    4236 |  4239 | and you have spoken in number of stories.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4236.0) |

|    4241 |  4243 | they'll be like, oh yeah, this is how many stories                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4241.0) |
|    4243 |  4245 | you get in this number of feet.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4243.0) |
|    4245 |  4247 | Are you saying, and in codes where you've worked                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4245.0) |

|    4251 |  4254 | Okay, so I'm sorry, I misunderstood                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4251.0) |
|    4254 |  4256 | how you were asking the question.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4254.0) |
|    4256 |  4258 | You were talking about defining, I thought you meant                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4256.0) |

|    4262 |  4263 | I might have asked you both.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4262.0) |
|    4263 |  4264 | Okay.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4263.0) |
|    4264 |  4266 | Now I'm asking you about stories versus feet.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4264.0) |
|    4266 |  4269 | Okay, so there's the written definition                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4266.0) |
|    4269 |  4272 | and that's what I was first responding to.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4269.0) |
|    4272 |  4276 | In terms of defining it in terms of standards,                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4272.0) |
|    4276 |  4281 | what we do, what we recommend is that you identify height                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4276.0) |
|    4281 |  4286 | but identify it to the eave and let the top of the roof                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4281.0) |
|    4286 |  4288 | be as tall as it needs to be.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4286.0) |
|    4288 |  4290 | They build more roof than they need to, right?                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4288.0) |
|    4290 |  4294 | Just let the roof be, let it be what it needs to be                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4290.0) |
|    4294 |  4298 | but regulate to the eave because that's what people                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4294.0) |
|    4298 |  4301 | perceive when it's too big is where's that eave,                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4298.0) |
|    4301 |  4303 | how tall are those two stories?                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4301.0) |
|    4303 |  4305 | That's when people say it's too big.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4303.0) |
|    4305 |  4308 | So you want to regulate the eave height.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4305.0) |
|    4308 |  4310 | That's what people are going to perceive.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4308.0) |
|    4310 |  4312 | And then if you want to regulate overall,                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4310.0) |
|    4312 |  4313 | you still can regulate it overall                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4312.0) |
|    4313 |  4315 | but the eave height is critical.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4313.0) |
|    4315 |  4318 | The other two things are the maximum width                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4315.0) |
|    4318 |  4321 | that the missing middle buildings can be on the street                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4318.0) |
|    4321 |  4324 | and the maximum depth down the side of the lot.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4321.0) |
|    4324 |  4326 | So today in talking with planning staff,                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4324.0) |
|    4326 |  4330 | we were talking about what that means in practical terms                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4326.0) |
|    4330 |  4333 | because most cities use lot coverage.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4330.0) |
|    4333 |  4337 | Lot coverage doesn't guarantee, and again,                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4333.0) |
|    4337 |  4339 | it's not your code only.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4337.0) |
|    4339 |  4342 | Every code that uses lot coverage has this issue.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4339.0) |
|    4342 |  4346 | Lot coverage does not prevent from a building being too long                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4342.0) |
|    4346 |  4348 | down one side yard and you're in your backyard                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4346.0) |
|    4348 |  4350 | and you say, wow, look at that thing.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4348.0) |
|    4350 |  4352 | It's like a cruise ship sitting next to me.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4350.0) |
|    4352 |  4353 | I live next to one of those.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4352.0) |
|    4353 |  4355 | Okay, so you know what I'm talking about                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4353.0) |
|    4355 |  4357 | but it complies with the standards.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4355.0) |
|    4357 |  4361 | The more effective thing is to regulate building footprint                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4357.0) |
|    4361 |  4365 | and just by the way, the missing middle building types                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4361.0) |
|    4365 |  4368 | don't need the same amount of lot coverage                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4365.0) |
|    4368 |  4371 | that most cities currently allow in their zoning.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4368.0) |
|    4371 |  4374 | Okay.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4371.0) |

|    4378 |  4380 | Thank you, Vice Mayor.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4378.0) |
|    4380 |  4384 | It was mentioned that the administration does not want to recreate                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4380.0) |
|    4384 |  4387 | the recode process                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4384.0) |
|    4387 |  4392 | but I do believe some expectations have been set                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4387.0) |
|    4392 |  4395 | going through that process.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4392.0) |
|    4395 |  4403 | What is the public engagement plan for whatever proposal                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4395.0) |
|    4403 |  4408 | that the administration plans to bring towards city council?                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4403.0) |
|    4408 |  4411 | So I think engagement starts today.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4408.0) |
|    4411 |  4418 | The mayor referenced our intention to think about housing a lot                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4411.0) |
|    4418 |  4423 | over the coming year and this is a big priority for our team.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4418.0) |
|    4423 |  4427 | Mr. Perez presented this morning at a great event                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4423.0) |

|    4430 |  4434 | and so again, we're very much in this engage and evaluate stage.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4430.0) |
|    4434 |  4436 | To the best practices that Tony presented,                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4434.0) |
|    4436 |  4439 | we really think that there's some education that we want to do                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4436.0) |
|    4439 |  4443 | in terms of broader community understanding of missing middle                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4439.0) |
|    4443 |  4445 | and the places in which it's most effective                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4443.0) |
|    4445 |  4448 | and why it can be beneficial to Knoxville.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4445.0) |
|    4448 |  4449 | When it comes to specific proposals,                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4448.0) |
|    4449 |  4452 | obviously there's a legislative process to change our zoning                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4449.0) |
|    4452 |  4457 | that's going to require just by default some points and checkpoints                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4452.0) |
|    4457 |  4460 | both with council as well as with planning.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4457.0) |
|    4460 |  4462 | So those would be part of the process.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4460.0) |
|    4462 |  4467 | I think that we are interested in wanting to be both nimble                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4462.0) |
|    4467 |  4471 | while also being intentional about bringing folks along                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4467.0) |
|    4471 |  4474 | so that folks are supportive of these strategies                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4471.0) |
|    4474 |  4477 | rather than feeling surprised and scared                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4474.0) |
|    4477 |  4480 | to see these types of opportunities emerge.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4477.0) |
|    4480 |  4482 | So again, we're at the beginning of a process,                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4480.0) |
|    4482 |  4485 | but we don't have any specific proposals for you today                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4482.0) |
|    4485 |  4487 | and so we'll be developing those as we move forward                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4485.0) |

|    4534 |  4538 | I encourage also other processes.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4534.0) |

|    4720 |  4725 | I really think I would encourage us to work hard to do that,                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4720.0) |

|    4727 |  4730 | I think when we talk about scale,                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4727.0) |

|    4736 |  4738 | what this missing metal looked like.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4736.0) |

|    4745 |  4747 | but maybe there are more units in it,                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4745.0) |
|    4747 |  4749 | I think that can be very helpful.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4747.0) |

|    4754 |  4761 | I do think it might entice more small homebuilders                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4754.0) |

|    4763 |  4766 | I lived through the recession of 2008 as a banker,                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4763.0) |
|    4766 |  4769 | and we didn't build houses in here after that.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4766.0) |
|    4769 |  4772 | So many small homebuilders went out of business.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4769.0) |

|    4781 |  4783 | a lot of money to get approved,                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4781.0) |
|    4783 |  4787 | I think you can entice more builders back into the market                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4783.0) |
|    4787 |  4789 | that will also increase supply.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4787.0) |
|    4789 |  4794 | So I like the idea of the pre-approved visual                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4789.0) |

|    4796 |  4800 | I think that will also help the community understand it.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4796.0) |

|    4802 |  4804 | Just a couple questions.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4802.0) |

|    4807 |  4811 | what's the thoughts on the best way to increase speed                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4807.0) |
|    4811 |  4813 | of conversion of those properties?                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4811.0) |

|    4818 |  4821 | but particularly related to blighted properties,                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4818.0) |

|    4823 |  4826 | What's the biggest barrier for that?                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4823.0) |
|    4826 |  4829 | I welcome insights from our housing and neighborhood team,                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4826.0) |
|    4829 |  4833 | but I think you all are oftentimes part of the process                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4829.0) |
|    4833 |  4836 | that it takes to acquire a blighted property,                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4833.0) |
|    4836 |  4840 | and I think we've had some not-so-distant past council discussions                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4836.0) |
|    4840 |  4841 | when it actually comes time.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4840.0) |
|    4841 |  4844 | I mean, there's a long process that the city must go through                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4841.0) |
|    4844 |  4848 | before we can acquire a chronic problem property, for example.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4844.0) |
|    4848 |  4850 | Homemakers is a little bit, you know,                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4848.0) |
|    4850 |  4852 | homemakers is the way we get rid of properties.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4850.0) |

|    4854 |  4856 | are the ways that we acquire properties.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4854.0) |
|    4856 |  4860 | So let me ask, does anyone want to kind of shed some light                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4856.0) |
|    4860 |  4861 | on this concept?                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4860.0) |
|    4861 |  4865 | But I think there's a couple ideas already kind of kicking around                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4861.0) |
|    4865 |  4869 | of ways that we can make sure people know about those opportunities                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4865.0) |
|    4869 |  4872 | and potentially even think about the Homemakers program                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4869.0) |

|    4879 |  4881 | really trying to make sure folks are aware of the opportunities,                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4879.0) |

|    4918 |  4921 | and getting them into the hands of developers.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4918.0) |
|    4921 |  4926 | But the idea of it in its inception was to create                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4921.0) |

|    4930 |  4935 | And so I recently had lunch with a developer who, you know, told me that.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4930.0) |
|    4935 |  4941 | He said, hey, we need to look at it with the lens of missing middle                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4935.0) |
|    4941 |  4945 | and see what modifications we need to make.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4941.0) |
|    4945 |  4946 | Okay.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4945.0) |
|    4946 |  4951 | And the other two questions I had, one was related to ADUs.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4946.0) |
|    4951 |  4961 | How many ADUs do we think have been built since we authorized that in the recode?                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4951.0) |

|    4974 |  4977 | To be honest with you, I don't know.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4974.0) |
|    4977 |  4980 | I honestly don't.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4977.0) |
|    4980 |  4981 | Okay.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4980.0) |
|    4981 |  4982 | Fair enough.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4981.0) |
|    4982 |  4983 | Sorry.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4982.0) |
|    4983 |  4985 | Thanks for taking a swing.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4983.0) |
|    4985 |  4989 | Maybe we can find that out as a follow-up for this.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4985.0) |
|    4989 |  4994 | The last question I had was related to pilots.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4989.0) |
|    4994 |  5000 | You know, I'm of the opinion that where pilots meet these key development                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=4994.0) |
|    5000 |  5005 | priorities for the administration, they should scale up and down.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5000.0) |
|    5005 |  5010 | So talk about any smaller pilots that have come through.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5005.0) |
|    5010 |  5013 | Ideally, those are coming through more frequently.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5010.0) |
|    5013 |  5020 | We've lowered the bar for what types of smaller developments can apply for a pilot.                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5013.0) |
|    5020 |  5021 | Is that right?                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5020.0) |
|    5021 |  5023 | And have we seen success in that?                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5021.0) |
|    5023 |  5024 | Yeah.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5023.0) |
|    5024 |  5027 | So I think I don't know that historically we would have said there was a bar,                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5024.0) |
|    5027 |  5031 | but certainly based on how we define the terms of the program,                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5027.0) |
|    5031 |  5036 | folks are seeing a pathway perhaps for some of those smaller projects that they didn't necessarily see before.                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5031.0) |
|    5036 |  5042 | So I don't know what's come before you already since we've really revised those pathways,                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5036.0) |
|    5042 |  5044 | but we do have several in the pipeline.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5042.0) |
|    5044 |  5048 | And, again, I want to emphasize here that we, to your point,                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5044.0) |
|    5048 |  5052 | this is a tool that should flex regardless of the size of the project.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5048.0) |
|    5052 |  5056 | And the fees scale, right, down with the value of the property?                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5052.0) |
|    5056 |  5057 | That's a good question.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5056.0) |
|    5057 |  5058 | I don't know if the fees scale.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5057.0) |
|    5058 |  5059 | They do, I'm being told.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5058.0) |
|    5059 |  5060 | Yes, they do.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5059.0) |
|    5060 |  5063 | So, again, really trying to make it something that can flex with the size of the project.                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5060.0) |
|    5063 |  5066 | Because that's one of the things I try to do when I talk to smaller developers                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5063.0) |
|    5066 |  5069 | is encourage them to apply for pilots just like big developers do.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5066.0) |
|    5069 |  5071 | We've got a process for that now.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5069.0) |
|    5071 |  5073 | We've scaled down the fees so that it's possible.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5071.0) |
|    5073 |  5076 | So anybody watching at home, I encourage you to give it a shot                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5073.0) |
|    5076 |  5078 | and let us know if it doesn't work out.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5076.0) |
|    5078 |  5084 | And I just want to, no question but comment, I think the South Bend case study,                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5078.0) |
|    5084 |  5087 | I think the Councilman Fugate's point,                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5084.0) |
|    5087 |  5092 | I think similar to the Urban League's efforts to involve minority-owned contractors                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5087.0) |
|    5092 |  5095 | in the multi-use stadium build,                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5092.0) |
|    5095 |  5101 | I think this seems like an opportunity to get a group together,                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5095.0) |
|    5101 |  5105 | narrowly focus on a repeatable process and make it easier, cheaper,                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5101.0) |
|    5105 |  5110 | and hopefully with better software, more efficient.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5105.0) |
|    5110 |  5111 | So that's all for me.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5110.0) |
|    5111 |  5112 | Thanks.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5111.0) |
|    5112 |  5113 | Thanks.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5112.0) |
|    5113 |  5114 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5113.0) |
|    5114 |  5115 | Councilmember Testerman.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5114.0) |
|    5115 |  5117 | Thank you, Vice Mayor.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5115.0) |
|    5117 |  5124 | Is there any way to go back to slide 11, page 11 in our hand, the pie chart,                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5117.0) |
|    5124 |  5129 | the next pie chart, that one.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5124.0) |
|    5129 |  5133 | And this just brought a thought to mind.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5129.0) |
|    5133 |  5138 | So it looks like just from the legend, the color code legend,                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5133.0) |
|    5139 |  5146 | and by the math there's roughly about 3% that should be RN5 in there in the infill.                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5139.0) |
|    5146 |  5149 | Oh, yep, we might have dropped that one, but I'll pass your math.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5146.0) |
|    5149 |  5151 | Yeah.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5149.0) |
|    5151 |  5156 | But it just sort of raised a thought for me on that.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5151.0) |
|    5156 |  5163 | And, again, I mean the infill overlay is such a small percentage of just the land in general.                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5156.0) |
|    5163 |  5177 | But on RN5 I know oftentimes when something is presented to us with a request to rezone to RN5,                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5163.0) |
|    5177 |  5181 | we kind of shudder thinking about the density of that.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5177.0) |
|    5181 |  5190 | But going, and there was a recent rezone before us recently that ended up being RN2                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5181.0) |
|    5190 |  5193 | with the proposal of duplexes.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5190.0) |
|    5193 |  5200 | But, you know, we'll take fourplexes, you know, within the presentation that was just done.                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5193.0) |
|    5200 |  5208 | And generally, if I'm not mistaking, that generally is going to require an RN5 zoning.                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5200.0) |
|    5208 |  5216 | And so I feel like sometimes, you know, which is a great opportunity to make meaningful impact, in my opinion.                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5208.0) |
|    5216 |  5224 | I mean, I think when we think RN5 we think about vast development and, you know, hundreds of units                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5216.0) |
|    5224 |  5230 | and just I think the visual of that.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5224.0) |
|    5230 |  5241 | And with that, however, I feel like we've pigeonholed our ability to really make that meaningful impact                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5230.0) |
|    5241 |  5246 | of being able to add a myriad of different types of housing.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5241.0) |
|    5246 |  5252 | So that would just be, I mean, I know that, you know, sometimes looking at that and it's like,                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5246.0) |
|    5252 |  5255 | well, okay, well, developers proposing that.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5252.0) |
|    5255 |  5260 | But, you know, once it's rezoned, then the fear is, well, they won't stick to this idea                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5255.0) |
|    5260 |  5268 | or they're going to max it out, which isn't, I really believe and know and feel like we've seen                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5260.0) |
|    5268 |  5277 | developers who are committed to and intentional about addressing this missing middle housing.                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5268.0) |
|    5277 |  5286 | And I just, you know, would encourage, you know, us to really think more broadly and thoughtfully                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5277.0) |
|    5286 |  5289 | and then, you know, win these opportunities.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5286.0) |
|    5290 |  5298 | And if it's a higher rezone to really look at the potential to address and make, you know,                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5290.0) |
|    5298 |  5305 | make the impact we need and make the inroads we need to be able to accommodate more units.                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5298.0) |
|    5305 |  5306 | So that's all.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5305.0) |
|    5306 |  5314 | I mean, just having seen some situations in the past where we did have a really good opportunity                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5306.0) |
|    5314 |  5322 | to add more housing in a consistent, you know, fourplex or multiplex way without doing a high rise                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5314.0) |
|    5322 |  5328 | or big apartment buildings that, you know, I think we've kind of missed some good opportunities.                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5322.0) |
|    5328 |  5332 | So I would just like to throw that out there.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5328.0) |

|    5338 |  5344 | We've talked about density a little bit earlier and density is not necessarily a bad thing.                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5338.0) |
|    5344 |  5348 | And, of course, in a lot of instances it's a really good thing.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5344.0) |
|    5348 |  5354 | Downtown, I don't know that it could be, you could have a problem with more density, you know.                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5348.0) |
|    5354 |  5362 | But density is important, but it's important inversely to infrastructure, you know.                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5354.0) |
|    5363 |  5374 | And what I see from your proposals is that you're proposing these missing middle units in places                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5363.0) |
|    5374 |  5382 | that have amenities already or can spur amenities relatively quickly.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5374.0) |
|    5382 |  5385 | Is that right, Tony?                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5382.0) |
|    5385 |  5387 | That's correct, Council Member.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5385.0) |
|    5387 |  5388 | Yes.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5387.0) |
|    5388 |  5389 | Okay.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5388.0) |
|    5389 |  5390 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5389.0) |
|    5390 |  5399 | And just to expand on that, often, and you'll get this question, so that's why I want to respond with this.                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5390.0) |
|    5399 |  5404 | People will ask you, wait a second, you're allowing a fourplex where a house is?                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5399.0) |
|    5404 |  5405 | Right.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5404.0) |
|    5405 |  5411 | And one of the things we've been told by infrastructure, out in California they have to do a bunch of reports about every project.          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5405.0) |
|    5411 |  5416 | And what the people told us over and over is they said, if you're putting in three or fourplexes,                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5411.0) |
|    5416 |  5422 | maybe even a fiveplex where a single family house is, chances are there are already three or four                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5416.0) |
|    5422 |  5424 | or five people living in that house anyway.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5422.0) |
|    5424 |  5429 | So the net change is not really significant about the impact on sewer or water.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5424.0) |
|    5429 |  5434 | You know, once you get above four or five, then that same case can't be made.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5429.0) |
|    5434 |  5435 | Right.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5434.0) |
|    5435 |  5436 | Yeah.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5435.0) |
|    5436 |  5442 | And I think if I understood you, you were saying that density just shouldn't be across the board the criteria.                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5436.0) |
|    5442 |  5443 | That's right.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5442.0) |
|    5443 |  5444 | Yeah.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5443.0) |
|    5444 |  5445 | It is.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5444.0) |
|    5445 |  5452 | It's site specific, you know, and so we have to constantly evaluate adding density to certain areas                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5445.0) |
|    5452 |  5458 | depending on whether or not the infrastructure is there, what impact it's going to have on the neighborhood, et cetera.                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5452.0) |
|    5458 |  5459 | Okay.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5458.0) |
|    5459 |  5460 | I understand.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5459.0) |
|    5460 |  5468 | The question I had is we're talking about the missing middle in RN areas.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5460.0) |
|    5468 |  5476 | Do you see a role in adding missing middle to basically the corridors, you know,                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5468.0) |
|    5476 |  5478 | the commercial areas of the corridors?                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5476.0) |
|    5478 |  5486 | Because that's something that I've always thought maybe we're not as a city in the past giving enough attention to                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5478.0) |
|    5486 |  5493 | because we've got what looks to me like a lot of underused space on the corridors.                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5486.0) |
|    5493 |  5495 | A lot of it is blighted.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5493.0) |
|    5496 |  5498 | And you have the infrastructure there.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5496.0) |
|    5498 |  5500 | You have the transportation there.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5498.0) |
|    5500 |  5504 | You have access to businesses.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5500.0) |
|    5504 |  5508 | Customers can, you know, the businesses can use those customers,                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5504.0) |
|    5508 |  5513 | and the residences also have employment opportunities there.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5508.0) |
|    5513 |  5523 | So since the discussion's all been in RN areas, do you see a place for missing middle on the corridors?                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5513.0) |
|    5523 |  5525 | Yes, certainly, Council Member.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5523.0) |
|    5525 |  5528 | I think there are two aspects to that.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5525.0) |
|    5528 |  5532 | You know, if you look at the missing middle palette that we've been talking about,                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5528.0) |
|    5532 |  5536 | there's a small and medium, which we're focusing on as a two-story variety, right?                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5532.0) |
|    5536 |  5543 | And then the large is the three-story variety, which you already have some here in the historic part of the city.                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5536.0) |
|    5543 |  5549 | So the corridors in between the centers, like what we often recommend to cities,                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5543.0) |
|    5549 |  5559 | ask them, where is your non-residential, you know, your commercial and your retail, where is it most vibrant?                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5549.0) |
|    5559 |  5568 | And then where it isn't, give those owners the opportunity to decide to do housing in between where it is vibrant in those segments, right? | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5559.0) |
|    5568 |  5575 | And so once you determine where that is, giving those owners that opportunity to do that is one thing.                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5568.0) |
|    5575 |  5583 | The second thing is then to say, where in those areas should it be this three-story large,                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5575.0) |
|    5583 |  5588 | or is it really the two-story variety that would work there,                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5583.0) |
|    5588 |  5594 | or is it that bigger five-story multifamily that, you know, is less defined?                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5588.0) |
|    5594 |  5599 | So one is finding those areas along corridors, which there are many areas,                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5594.0) |
|    5600 |  5607 | and then secondly, determining which part of the spectrum you're thinking about.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5600.0) |
|    5607 |  5615 | I would like for the conversation to be expanded or at least that to be part of the discussion about what we can do with those corridors.   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5607.0) |
|    5615 |  5624 | And then I guess another comment, I'm really glad to see some kind of middle option between what we've built in the past                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5615.0) |
|    5624 |  5631 | and something between single family and then the multi, you know, huge units that go in.                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5624.0) |
|    5631 |  5638 | And it's been my experience that most neighborhoods will accept reasonable growth.                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5631.0) |
|    5638 |  5648 | It's the big units, multi-units that have the power to really transform the ambience of a neighborhood                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5638.0) |
|    5648 |  5654 | and overwhelm the infrastructure there.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5648.0) |
|    5654 |  5659 | So this discussion is really very welcome, I think,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5654.0) |
|    5659 |  5667 | and at least the units that I've seen here, the scale of them and the surroundings,                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5659.0) |
|    5667 |  5676 | where you have more of a, I guess, quality of life, really, to where you have, you can get outside easier.                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5667.0) |
|    5676 |  5686 | You know, it's more consistent with kind of smaller units that people prefer to live in.                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5676.0) |
|    5686 |  5693 | And a lot of the people who live in the big, big multi-units, you know,                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5686.0) |
|    5693 |  5703 | their eventual goal is to move and move into a single family residence or move into housing that's of a smaller scale.                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5693.0) |
|    5703 |  5708 | And so I'm really glad we're having this discussion.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5703.0) |
|    5708 |  5716 | And so it sounds a lot more neighborhood friendly than the way we've been doing it in the past.                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5708.0) |
|    5716 |  5719 | So this is just the beginning.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5716.0) |
|    5719 |  5720 | We know that.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5719.0) |
|    5720 |  5722 | We'll have a lot more discussions.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5720.0) |
|    5722 |  5724 | But those are just my thoughts at the moment.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5722.0) |
|    5724 |  5726 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5724.0) |
|    5726 |  5731 | Council Member Parker.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5726.0) |
|    5731 |  5735 | Thank you, Vice Mayor.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5731.0) |
|    5735 |  5747 | Just going back to the plan moving forward, once the targeted area for zoning tweaks is identified,                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5735.0) |
|    5747 |  5754 | I think it's really important that a letter is sent to all impacted property owners,                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5747.0) |
|    5754 |  5764 | and that we have a workshop on the proposed changes with a public forum so that we can have input                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5754.0) |
|    5764 |  5770 | and an opportunity to be transparent about what's suggested,                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5764.0) |
|    5770 |  5777 | show all these beautiful pictures of these non-high-rise buildings that we're talking about,                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5770.0) |
|    5778 |  5782 | and hopefully, you know, quell some of the fear                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5778.0) |
|    5782 |  5791 | and some of the frustration that we've already just recently gone through a major rezoning process.                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5782.0) |
|    5791 |  5798 | And through that process, you know, I feel like a lot of promises were made that this was a big rezoning process,                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5791.0) |
|    5798 |  5804 | first in 50 years, and we weren't going to see another one like it anytime soon.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5798.0) |
|    5804 |  5810 | And to me, this feels like a big change following that process.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5804.0) |
|    5810 |  5819 | So I'm really encouraging that we notify those who will be directly impacted, bring them into the conversation,                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5810.0) |
|    5819 |  5828 | and hopefully move this forward with some excitement in the community and less concern.                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5819.0) |
|    5828 |  5831 | Council Member Ryder.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5828.0) |
|    5831 |  5836 | Yeah, so I have two questions at the moment.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5831.0) |
|    5836 |  5841 | This one may be, let's see, I don't know, Brian Berry may be able to answer me.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5836.0) |
|    5841 |  5843 | So you guys are on notice. Don't jump out of your chair.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5841.0) |
|    5843 |  5849 | Brian Berry, Mr. Welch, Liz Albertson, you guys might collectively be able to answer this question.                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5843.0) |
|    5849 |  5853 | We have pocket neighborhood in our zoning code.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5849.0) |
|    5853 |  5857 | To you guys' knowledge, has that ever been used?                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5853.0) |
|    5857 |  5859 | All shaking your heads. Okay, thanks.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5857.0) |
|    5859 |  5862 | Yeah, implemented into the code way before I was on council.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5859.0) |
|    5862 |  5864 | That was a pre-recode.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5862.0) |
|    5864 |  5866 | I don't remember if we moved it over.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5864.0) |
|    5866 |  5868 | I just remember a lot of conversation way back.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5866.0) |
|    5868 |  5869 | Okay, no one's ever used it.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5868.0) |

|    5871 |  5874 | I think I'm going to go in June and look at one in Atlanta.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5871.0) |
|    5874 |  5876 | All right, moving on.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5874.0) |
|    5876 |  5882 | Thank you to one of our constituents out here that taught me about that place.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5876.0) |
|    5882 |  5888 | So the next question, Ms. Gill, you mentioned updates to the one-year plan                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5882.0) |
|    5888 |  5891 | to provide greater opportunity for missing middle housing.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5888.0) |
|    5891 |  5893 | Tell me what you mean to that.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5891.0) |
|    5893 |  5899 | Do you mean like modifications to the one-year plan and the sector plan that are presented                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5893.0) |
|    5899 |  5905 | in the annual one-year plan that would show medium density?                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5899.0) |
|    5905 |  5907 | Clarify the statement.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5905.0) |
|    5907 |  5910 | Yeah, so first of all, I do want to differentiate.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5907.0) |
|    5910 |  5912 | The sector plans are a pretty big undertaking.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5910.0) |
|    5912 |  5914 | We're not talking about that.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5912.0) |
|    5914 |  5915 | You said one-year plan.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5914.0) |
|    5915 |  5916 | We did say one-year plan.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5915.0) |
|    5916 |  5921 | So I think this is an opportunity to, again, use some of the language that                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5916.0) |
|    5921 |  5924 | OptiCoast has identified as really beneficial to use.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5921.0) |
|    5924 |  5928 | So, again, thinking about whether it's just putting the term missing middle housing                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5924.0) |
|    5928 |  5931 | as a defined term so that people understand it.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5928.0) |
|    5931 |  5934 | We want to make sure that we're setting the stage at a pretty high level.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5931.0) |
|    5934 |  5938 | And so those one-year plans, and I'll look to maybe Ms. Crockett                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5934.0) |
|    5938 |  5943 | or some of the other folks on planning to think about some of the potential examples.                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5938.0) |
|    5943 |  5948 | But we recognize that, again, this is a construct that we don't define                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5943.0) |
|    5948 |  5950 | or speak to right now at all.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5948.0) |
|    5950 |  5953 | It's either single-family or it's multifamily, and we're talking about this space between.                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5950.0) |
|    5953 |  5959 | And so we want to make sure that that space between is reflected in our plans                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5953.0) |
|    5959 |  5964 | that then guide you all as a legislative body and our commissioners on planning                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5959.0) |
|    5964 |  5966 | when they're evaluating potential zoning decisions.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5964.0) |
|    5966 |  5969 | So does someone from planning want to speak to any more particular ideas                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5966.0) |
|    5969 |  5972 | that you might identify?                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5969.0) |
|    5972 |  5973 | Yeah.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5972.0) |
|    5973 |  5974 | Liz.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5973.0) |
|    5974 |  5975 | Liz can.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5974.0) |
|    5975 |  5980 | She's ready.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5975.0) |
|    5980 |  5981 | Hi.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5980.0) |
|    5981 |  5983 | Liz Albertson.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5981.0) |
|    5983 |  5986 | I just wanted to point out that in our one-year plan,                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5983.0) |
|    5986 |  5991 | an example of this would be the location criteria that we have for duplexes.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5986.0) |
|    5991 |  5996 | So you may have heard this brought up during the special use review process sometimes                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5991.0) |
|    5996 |  6001 | by constituents concerned about where duplexes would be permitted                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=5996.0) |
|    6001 |  6003 | within an existing neighborhood.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6001.0) |
|    6003 |  6009 | So in our current one-year plan, it says that they must be on a collector street,                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6003.0) |
|    6009 |  6013 | and there are several other.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6009.0) |
|    6013 |  6018 | They must not have gross density exceeding five dwelling units per acre.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6013.0) |
|    6019 |  6021 | So there are several other, you know,                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6019.0) |
|    6021 |  6026 | things noted under the location criteria within the one-year plan for duplexes                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6021.0) |
|    6026 |  6031 | that could be a barrier to some of the missing middle housing types                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6026.0) |
|    6031 |  6033 | that we've discussed.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6031.0) |
|    6033 |  6041 | So if I were to go pull a permit to put a duplex from the planning commission                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6033.0) |
|    6041 |  6047 | right now, how does that get triggered, that it be on whichever arterial?                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6041.0) |
|    6047 |  6053 | Well, it would only come to planning commission if it was a special use,                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6047.0) |
|    6053 |  6055 | if it was listed as that in the use matrix.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6053.0) |
|    6055 |  6056 | Okay.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6055.0) |
|    6056 |  6057 | Correct.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6056.0) |
|    6057 |  6058 | Okay.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6057.0) |
|    6058 |  6064 | So let's say I own a lot on Oklahoma Avenue, okay, and an empty lot.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6058.0) |
|    6064 |  6069 | And I came to you guys, it's in an RN2, and I came to you guys                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6064.0) |
|    6069 |  6072 | and I said, hey, I need to sign up for my special use.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6069.0) |
|    6072 |  6076 | I want to put a duplex on this lot, which actually I guess I couldn't                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6072.0) |
|    6076 |  6078 | because it's a 5,000-square-foot lot.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6076.0) |
|    6078 |  6081 | So let's pretend I have a 10,000-square-foot lot, okay?                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6078.0) |
|    6081 |  6085 | We're going to pretend that it's 10,000-square-foot, it's on Oklahoma Avenue.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6081.0) |
|    6085 |  6087 | You're familiar with that at where it is, Ms. Albertson?                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6085.0) |
|    6087 |  6088 | Yes.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6087.0) |
|    6088 |  6089 | Okay.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6088.0) |
|    6089 |  6090 | It's not a collector street.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6089.0) |
|    6090 |  6091 | It's not a collector street.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6090.0) |
|    6091 |  6095 | So you would say, deny, you can't file a special use and you can't do that.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6091.0) |
|    6095 |  6096 | Correct?                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6095.0) |
|    6096 |  6100 | I don't think that staff would be quite so harsh in that.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6096.0) |
|    6100 |  6104 | Oh, okay, they'd nicely say, sorry, ma'am, this doesn't comply.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6100.0) |
|    6104 |  6109 | I think that we would acknowledge that there are discrepancies between the plan,                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6104.0) |
|    6109 |  6115 | what the plan says, you know, and even if we think that, you know,                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6109.0) |
|    6115 |  6121 | oh, well, it does make sense because it's also within 250 feet of a bus line,                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6115.0) |
|    6121 |  6125 | you know, I think we would acknowledge that in the staff report                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6121.0) |
|    6125 |  6130 | and then also lean to the legislative bodies to sort of make those determinations.                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6125.0) |
|    6130 |  6133 | But then you will also hear from your constituents that will say,                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6130.0) |
|    6133 |  6136 | well, the one-year plan says this, so we should not allow it.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6133.0) |
|    6136 |  6138 | Okay.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6136.0) |
|    6138 |  6141 | All right, appreciate that clarification on the one-year plan.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6138.0) |
|    6141 |  6143 | I'll be quiet for now.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6141.0) |
|    6143 |  6146 | Oh, I just went, Mr. Berry walked out.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6143.0) |
|    6146 |  6151 | I will say the only knowledge of mine since RECODE passed of an ADU in the                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6146.0) |
|    6151 |  6157 | 4th District was in Holston Hills, and it's on Crestwood.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6151.0) |
|    6157 |  6160 | I might have gotten that street wrong, but, yeah.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6157.0) |

|    6163 |  6164 | Council Member Smith.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6163.0) |
|    6164 |  6165 | Thank you, Vice Mayor.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6164.0) |
|    6165 |  6167 | I just want to follow up on Council Member Parker's comments.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6165.0) |
|    6167 |  6173 | I think this is a great opportunity to go to neighborhoods directly as                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6167.0) |
|    6173 |  6176 | opposed to having a centralized location wherever one comes because                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6173.0) |
|    6176 |  6179 | they'll tell you, you know, the lots that they want.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6176.0) |
|    6179 |  6184 | So, I mean, trying to proceed with the least barrier,                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6179.0) |
|    6184 |  6186 | go to the neighborhoods and say where do you want,                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6184.0) |
|    6187 |  6194 | and I think that will take care of a lot of low-hanging fruit.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6187.0) |

|    6202 |  6207 | which I think could be added into the plan, absolutely.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6202.0) |
|    6207 |  6209 | But some of the projects that have come before us,                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6207.0) |
|    6209 |  6215 | the one that came before us and is on our agenda next Tuesday,                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6209.0) |
|    6216 |  6219 | is happening in an area where there's not a neighborhood group.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6216.0) |
|    6219 |  6222 | I think they're looking to form one, but there isn't one.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6219.0) |
|    6222 |  6233 | And so I don't want to miss having opportunities for input from                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6222.0) |
|    6233 |  6236 | neighbors who aren't included in a neighborhood group.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6233.0) |
|    6236 |  6242 | So I still would push for a workshop with public forum so that those                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6236.0) |
|    6242 |  6245 | who are interested, just like during the recode process,                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6242.0) |
|    6245 |  6249 | would be able to give feedback, lift up concerns,                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6245.0) |
|    6249 |  6254 | lift up their support of the plan, but be a part of that process.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6249.0) |
|    6254 |  6259 | I think that's certainly something we can evaluate.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6254.0) |
|    6259 |  6262 | All right, seeing no more lights on, I want to thank Mr. Perez,                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6259.0) |
|    6262 |  6265 | Deputy to the Mayor Gill, city and planning staff,                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6262.0) |
|    6265 |  6269 | who answered some questions for us for a very informative                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6265.0) |
|    6269 |  6272 | and good discussion on missing middle housing.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6269.0) |
|    6272 |  6274 | We appreciate your time.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230330?start=6272.0) |
