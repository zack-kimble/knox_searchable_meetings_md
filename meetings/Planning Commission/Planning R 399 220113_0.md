| 0:09:43| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| In regards to item 22, which is Michael Altman and the change of special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=584)|
| 0:09:54| I'm the property owner next door, and it was proposed that it should be delayed 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=594)|
| 0:10:00| But the reason was because you hadn't heard from me that we had been working with the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=600)|
| 0:10:07| And so I wanted to – there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| So I just wanted to have that – to say that so that it would not be postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| because I am the representative of the owners next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| and that was the main reason why the postponement was being requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| So we don't have 22 on the postponement list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=626)|

| 0:13:56| So I just want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=836)|

| 0:14:08| That was postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=848)|

| 0:14:31| I think he misspoke and it needs to be item 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| And I thought I listed fairly clear when you guys listed it off earlier that it was not 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=875)|
| 0:14:42| Item 23 is Turner Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=882)|

| 0:21:38| and is consistent with the northeast county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1298)|

| 0:21:58| The applicant on this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| we originally sought to rezone this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| to planned residential for up to 12 dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| because the sector plan specifically called for there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| to be considerations of medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| in this mixed-use special district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| and 12 units and acres is certainly within that range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| Staff's recommendation is to approve planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| at nine dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| and we have no objection to what staff has recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| Oftentimes when I'm here asking for a zoning change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| there's a corresponding sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| especially if you're looking at densities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| between six and 12 dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| which is medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| That's not required here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| The 2015 northeast county sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| specifically determined that this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| around the Harbison Crossroads should be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| for medium density residential because of the recent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| and planned improvements to the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| and because this would be a transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| between the commercial property adjacent to it on the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| and the lower density residential, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| on the west and lower density residential to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| That sector plan specifically incorporated the 23.49 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| that is this property within its boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| Medium density residential is defined as 612 dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| and nine is right in the middle of that range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| and as staff, Ms. Albertson pointed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| during the agenda review meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| there is other densities, other zoning with densities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| in the area that are consistent with this range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| specifically about 580 feet to the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| there is a significant amount of RB zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| which allows up to 12 dwelling units an acre as of right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| and can allow up to 24 dwelling units an acre on a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| A little further out, about 1,200 feet southwest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| is a zoning of planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| for up to nine dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| It's right above the Fairview Road portion on the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| If you go up beside the commercial, zoom in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| might have to zoom in a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| because there's no plan on it right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| Planned residential, nine dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| It was noted during Tuesday's agenda review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| that the sector plan in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| still remains low density residential and that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| There was an application to amend the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| for that piece of property in 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| to medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| I thought I heard Ms. Albertson say that that request was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| I went back and looked at the plan history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| for that particular request and it was not denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1494)|
| 0:24:59| It was withdrawn by the applicant before a vote was taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| But staff's recommendation at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| was to amend the North County sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| to medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| for the same reasons that the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| for Harbinson's Crossroad was rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| to mixed-use special district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| There are significant infrastructure improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| both with regard to potential traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| and to the new middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| that call for this area to be more of a transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| between commercial nodes and lower density residential nodes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| Whether or not that would have passed, we don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| because the applicant withdrew that application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| But staff did recommend NDR for that PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| 9 million units an acre at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1541)|
| 0:25:51| Also at that time, there was quite a bit of conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| for there to be a need for additional housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| Whenever you have a new school or improvement to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| then those will draw more of a residential need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| for increased housing and density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| That's what was both behind the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| that was sought in 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| and the 2015 amendments to Harbinson's Crossroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| And that need for affordable housing, for more housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| was true in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| It's even more true in 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| There was also some conversation about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| although the sector plan does allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| for medium-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| there's not been any medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| that has been actually rezoned or developed in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| And again, that is also true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| but someone has to be the first applicant to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| and take advantage of the plans as they are amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| Otherwise, we'd still be looking at low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| all across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| When there are improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| when there are road improvements, as they are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| when there are improvements to infrastructure in schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| as they are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| then that need is identified through the sector plan process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| We're often hearing neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| when they're opposing sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| we want the sector plan to be followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| and we want the sector plan to be upheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| And that's all we're asking here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| And again, non-dwelling units and acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| are certainly, I think, an appropriate compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| from what we originally asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| and what staff has recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| So I would ask that you approve this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| And any additional time I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| I don't know if I have any additional time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| but I would like to reserve to respond to any comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| Chair recognizes Mr. Adam Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| And you have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| Adam Thompson, 7423 Earl Greyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| Coragin, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| I actually live in that orange section there in Easton Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| And so the application that he referenced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| that had been withdrawn before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| had over 300 signatures on a petition opposing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| There was a lot of opposition to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| and there's a reason that the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| withdrew the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| The issues that we see here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| of course, you've received over 57 public comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| as of today against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| Some of the biggest ones, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| Beaver Creek Watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| Beaver Creek runs right through the middle of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| It is a protected watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| So anybody that goes in and tries to develop this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| there's a lot of red tape and a lot of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| they'll have to do to protect this watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| It does fall in the PRZ zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| So every child there will have to walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| or be taken to school by a parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| It's already congested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| Yes, there are improvements that have been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| to that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| There have been turn lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| There's been a traffic light put in, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| But it's right there at that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| Another thing is that it's already congested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| And I know staff recommendations say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| there's improvements to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| We can withstand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| We can withstand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| It's in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| It's in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| Well, there's already three subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| that have been approved that are under development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| but have not been fully built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| Nobody's moved into them yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| We haven't seen the implications of those new residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| in those subdivisions at this intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| because they will all use this intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| We haven't seen that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| We haven't seen that traffic congestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| and our schools are already full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| So those new families haven't even moved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| So to just approve another rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| just for sake of looking on paper and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| oh, this makes sense, it doesn't make sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| when we already have three that have been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| or being built out but haven't been completed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| The one thing that kind of struck me is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| there's no plan, there's no concept, and there's no buyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| The reason for this rezoning is to help market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| this piece of property for the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| It's zoned ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| To go ahead and get the PR zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| for up to nine dwelling units breaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| is great for a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| It's very marketable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| But the last time I checked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| it isn't MPC's responsibility to assist landowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| in marketing their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| And so I know we've all slept since then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| so let's take a trip down memory lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| In May of 2020, Mr. Mullins, on behalf of Ann Rowland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| file number 5J20RZ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| they were requesting a rezoning from ag to PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| up to three and a half dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| Same attorney, same request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| It's just a different day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| You all decided that day to say no and decline it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| because the only reason for the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| was to help Ms. Rowland, the landowner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| who I'm a fan of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| I've been on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| I know her very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| But the only reason was to help market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| The landowners here, it was an inheritance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| They received it from their father| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| who recently passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| But it was purchased as an investment property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| This is a marketing proposal for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| to help market it and increase the value of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| So we're asking you to stay true to your stance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| as not being a marketing tool for landowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| for unfounded rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| You rezone it today, we have to live with it forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| No matter what happens in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| they might not find a buyer for another 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| But if that rezoning is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| we have to abide by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| So as you did in 2020 without a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| a concept, or a buyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| we're asking you to stay true and say no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| and deny this rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| Thank you, Mr. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| Mr. Mullen, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| If I could have two minutes to rebut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| especially since they were referring to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| some previous zonings I was involved in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| I'd like to clarify the record for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| If we give you two minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| then we'll have to extend the same to Mr. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| No objection to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| I'll give you up to two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| They referred to the Ann Rowland rezoning back in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| That zoning was approved for up to three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| The only difference between staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| and what this planning commission did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| and ultimately what county commission did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| was a half dwelling unit an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| This commission approved 2.5 dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| and county commission increased that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| to three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| It is true that there was no buyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| for Ms. Rowland's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| That's not true here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| There is a buyer in line for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| East Tennessee Land Development is the potential buyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| I filed this application just before the rules changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| where that information needed to be disclosed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| so it wasn't part of the application itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| but we're not trying to hide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| There is a potential buyer in line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| but you don't have to have a buyer in line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| to approve a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| You don't have to have a concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| or anything lined up yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| That's not going to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| until we know what kind of density is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| Obviously the density comes before you can plan for the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| and this body will have an opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| because we're asking for it to be rezoned to planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| will have an opportunity to look at whatever plan is in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| That's going to have to address...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| It's going to have to be a traffic impact analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| It's going to have to be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1998)|
| 0:33:19| We're going to have to address the environmental concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| with Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| We understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| That's part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| This is step one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| They're asking about step two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| so we would ask that you follow staff's recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| stay consistent with the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| and approve this rezoning per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| Mr. Thomas, do you have any comments you'd like to make before we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| I just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| As far as the community and the neighbors around this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| I still go back to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| There are subdivisions and developments in this immediate area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| that have been approved that haven't been built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| We haven't seen the implications of those yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| And so to do a blanket...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| Just to do a default rezoning just because it was requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| without seeing a concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| I don't think it's unreasonable for the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| and the residents in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| because, yes, it is a rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| People move to Coryton because it is a rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| They love getting away from the hustle and bustle of West Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| and other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| We're a little rural town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| And if you'll look in the 2005 concept plan, the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2066)|
| 0:34:32| the reason one of the highlighted sections was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| we wanted to maintain the rural feel of Coryton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| And so it doesn't seem to me or any of the other residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| too much to ask to see a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| And why is it on the back of the current landowner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| to put forth a concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| to get the rezoning and not the buyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| Why can't the buyer apply for a rezoning and a concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| to see if it's worth their investment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| I mean, for the landowner to go ahead and go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| OK, I'll get the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| Now you come forth and see if it's worth your investment to do your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| If it's not, that owner walks away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| We're still stuck with the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| We're still living with the consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| Commissioners, we conclude public comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| Any comments from the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| One of the things I'm thinking as you were speaking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| the property and rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| people that own property do have a right to ask for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| Whether we approve it or not, that's another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| But anybody can ask to have their property rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| without giving a reason even,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| other than they want to have it rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| As far as the concept plan and that kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| under the plan residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| the concept plan has to come back to us at the point that they do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| And the reason it's not done now is that's expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| And without the applicant knowing what their density is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| it would be a colossal waste of money to come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| I don't disagree with you that maybe that process could be different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2175)|
| 0:36:21| but that's what the process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| You have to go through the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| and then you come back for the concept plan at a later time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| Having said that, I'd like to make a motion that we approve PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2188)|
| 0:36:35| up to nine dwelling units per acre per staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| We have a motion by Commissioner Roth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| seconded by Commissioner Graf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| to approve PR, planned residential zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| up to nine dwelling units per acre per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| You heard the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2219)|

| 0:37:11| This is a sector plan amendment and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| The applicant is Mark Ridenour, Veterinary Center Development Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| location east side of Lake Heritage Way due south of Westlands Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2240)|
| 0:37:27| Tract is 2.76 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| Present plan designation and zoning is office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| OB office medical and related services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| Proposed plan designation and zoning is neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| and general business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| Staff recommendation approve the southwest county sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| to mixed-use special district south side of Westlands Drive west of I-140| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2267)|

| 0:37:59| Staff recommendation on the rezoning is approve PC planned commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| because it complies with the recommended amendment to the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2284)|

| 0:38:18| Mitch Rosenzweig, CEO of Veterinary Center Development Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| Applicant, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| Your name and address, please, again, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| Mitch Rosenzweig, 10808 Thornton Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2311)|
| 0:38:38| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| Happy New Year to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| Just since I have five minutes, I can make a little bit of a speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| I don't know if you all are aware of this or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| but during COVID there was a 77% increase in the pet adoptions in the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2327)|
| 0:38:53| That has put a heck of a burden on our profession, not only the veterinary profession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| but also the entire industry involved in pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| And I know that many of you do have pets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| and you've met me before with other clinics we've built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| So our company has set out to build clinics around the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| especially in Knoxville where we live, to help fulfill this requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| And we've done several with you over the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| The zoning in this area has changed quite a bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| so it's a challenge to find properties that we can actually put veterinary centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| And when we find one we like, we fight very hard for zoning and your approval, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| At this specific property, we have spoken to Weigel's, the retail stores next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2374)|
| 0:39:42| We're right adjacent to the Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| There's a pet-friendly apartment complex with hundreds of apartments behind us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| and two big dog parks back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| And we're right next door to Rural Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| Actually, I was talking to Oliver, and I said we were talking with the Rural Metro guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| We were thinking about buying them a Dalmatian as a gift because they didn't have one for the fire truck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| so we thought that would be real nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| We thought when we originally found this property that OB would be acceptable for a veterinary hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2406)|
| 0:40:11| As it turns out, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| I think we used to do it through OB with use on review, but I think that that has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| Not only will we seek your approval, but if you know Oliver, he's pretty hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2418)|
| 0:40:23| He wants things a certain way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| So this will be a beautiful center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| You've approved one on Emory for us and one on Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| And if you've gone by, you see that we do build top-of-the-line, beautiful clinics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2430)|
| 0:40:37| that complement the community and the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| I also built the Animal Emergency and Specialty Center in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| If you've ever gone by there at Pellissippi, you'll see that we are building state-of-the-art facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2443)|
| 0:40:49| that the neighborhoods usually appreciate, and they look very nice, and they complement everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| So I think this will be a great addition to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| We originally had asked for CA zoning, because with CA zoning, we know what we're getting into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2458)|
| 0:41:04| We're happy to do PC zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| This board has always been very reasonable and fair, and we've met everything you've asked of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| We've already checked the setbacks, and we certainly can fit everything there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| And we would appreciate it if you were to grant us this, and we will meet your requirements, whatever you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2476)|
| 0:41:22| There will not be any outdoor runs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| We know that in Knoxville that's something, noises of a concern, especially to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| We always make sure that we do not leave animals outside barking and that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2489)|
| 0:41:35| And we're very cognitive about smell and cleanliness and everything else that you've required of us in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2495)|
| 0:41:41| So this will be no different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| But if you have any questions for me, I'd be happy to answer them at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2509)|

| 0:43:07| Present plan and zoning designation is NC Neighborhood Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| Proposed plan designation, MUSD mixed-use special district, MUCC 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2591)|
| 0:43:19| Staff recommendation on the sector plan is to approve the central city sector plan amendment to mixed-use special district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2599)|
| 0:43:27| because it is an extension of the land use classification and it's compatible with surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2607)|
| 0:43:36| Recommendation from staff on the one-year plan amendment is to approve mixed-use special district land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2616)|
| 0:43:43| because it is an extension of that land use classification and it's compatible with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2623)|
| 0:43:50| On the rezoning, staff recommends approve industrial mixed-use zoning because it is an extension of zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2630)|
| 0:43:57| and it's compatible with surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2640)|

| 0:44:22| Again, we feel that it's compatible use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| The reason for the rezoning is simply the uses that the applicant seeks to place in the mixed-use building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| So we're excited to bring some commercial activity to that sector of the Fort Sanders district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2670)|
| 0:44:36| Thank you, Mr. Danes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2676)|

| 0:47:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2830)|
| 0:47:11| Mr. Mullins, would you like to go first or would you like the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| I'll go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| We're not asking for-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| Five minutes, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| Five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2838)|
| 0:47:19| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, suite 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| Here for the applicant Perry Smith Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| We had filed a request to postpone this until the February 2022 meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2845)|
| 0:47:33| really to evaluate what staff's recommendations are and see what our options may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| My client, Perry Smith, and his in-house counsel have both had health issues and been out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2858)|
| 0:47:45| I just haven't had a chance to really sit down and digest this recommendation with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| and talk about what our options are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| So that's the reason we are postponing it, and we understand there is quite a bit of neighborhood opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| There's two very good attorneys behind me that are going to argue that we shouldn't postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| You should just go ahead and deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| But I don't think giving 30 days, which for an application, the first time it's been before the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2883)|
| 0:48:11| when no requests to postpone have been asked for or granted before, that's, I think, fairly typical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2891)|
| 0:48:17| I mean, you have the discretion one way or the other, but I think it is fairly typical to afford that postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2897)|
| 0:48:24| And if we're here in February and nothing's changed, then we can vote on it up or down at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2904)|
| 0:48:30| But given that I haven't had a chance to really digest this and talk to my clients about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| I am asking for a 30-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| And if there's another person desiring to speak, if you don't mind splitting that five minutes between the two of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2922)|
| 0:48:49| Is this just on the postponement issue or the overall issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| Well, right now the request is to put it on the agenda for consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| but Mr. Mullins is asking for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| And generally, now I'm not going to say what the commission might do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| but generally the commission will heavily consider the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| But, you know, proceed as you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| My name is Shelly Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| I am here on behalf of 53 homeowners in Joshua's Landing subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2950)|
| 0:49:15| which is opposite the other side of Tazewell Pike from this development or this property, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2955)|
| 0:49:23| We oppose the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2963)|
| 0:49:27| It was just filed at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| We have everybody, you know, on board here to argue this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| There's nothing that's going to change in the next 30 days that will change the situation right now that causes the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2974)|
| 0:49:43| I believe, what causes the staff and what causes us opposition to this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| We've got the sinkhole issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| and we've got traffic that is going to be increased at approximately 1,400 vehicles a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2990)|
| 0:49:58| if this development were to go through the way that they plan upon rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| Your Honor, I'm sorry, I'm so used to being in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| Let me just talk to you real quick about the 30-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| In 1988, let me start there, 1988, the government zoned that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3010)|
| 0:50:17| And in the 30-year plan in 2003, they adopted certain criteria for medium-density residences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3017)|
| 0:50:25| which is transitional area between commercial and low-density residence areas served by transit or sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3025)|
| 0:50:33| Neither of those are currently met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| You've heard all and you've seen the people that have proffered their comments online saying that the traffic is already so bad on Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3035)|
| 0:50:44| I'm not going to add to that general statement, but I'm going to tell you that according to the 2007 North City Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3044)|
| 0:50:52| there are numerous projects that are planned for Tazewell Pike, none of which have started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3052)|
| 0:50:58| So that tells you that back in 2007, our government already recognized the traffic problems on Tazewell Pike and the needs for some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3058)|
| 0:51:08| It's already increased, nothing has changed, and now they're going to throw another 1,400 cars a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3068)|
| 0:51:15| Not to say the number of students that would be impacted at Shenandoah Elementary School right around the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3075)|
| 0:51:21| So we are in opposition, and I believe Mr. Taylor wanted to speak as well on behalf of his clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| I'm Charles Taylor. I live at 4801 Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| There's one house between me and the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| I'm also the attorney for the Tazewell Pike-Beverly Station Neighborhood Coalition and Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3099)|
| 0:51:46| I'm only going to address the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| My clients and I have gone to a lot of expense and trouble getting ready for this meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| Just like has been previously said, there's nothing going to change between now and February 10th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3114)|
| 0:52:00| and we ask that you deny the postponement and go ahead and vote on the staff's recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| Thank you, Mr. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3126)|
| 0:52:12| If I could be brief, I'd be remiss not to point out that I guess Joshua's Landing that's opposing this rezoning is in a medium-density residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3132)|
| 0:52:23| But that aside, we haven't had a chance to talk to my clients about what their options are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3143)|
| 0:52:32| We are considering, and Mr. Harvey and I are going to talk to our clients about what converting this to a planned residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3152)|
| 0:52:42| and trying to stay within the sector plan would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| And that's where we need more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| We just don't want to have to necessarily go back through the entire process if that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3166)|
| 0:52:53| And if they are not in favor of it, then we will be here probably withdrawing this in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| But, again, 30 days is not going to change this one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| Staff's recommendation was to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| So I don't think the real preparation would be for us to try to contest that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3185)|
| 0:53:11| which at this point we're not prepared to do because I haven't even talked to my clients about all the other options that may be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3191)|
| 0:53:17| So, again, we're just asking for a 30-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| I'd be glad to talk to the neighborhood during that time to see if we can address some of their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3201)|
| 0:53:26| I know there's a lot of concerns about sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| Of course, that would have to be addressed in the site plan and permitting one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| So just another 30 days would give us a chance to look at this a little bit more intently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| I know normally we do give preference to or deference to someone who wants to postpone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3223)|
| 0:53:50| but I am compelled by the argument that nothing is going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| Like the sinkholes are not going to go away during this period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| and the traffic circumstances wouldn't be changing, which were the basis for the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3238)|
| 0:54:04| And the other question I have is there could have been a withdrawal or postponement request made prior to today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3244)|
| 0:54:14| which seems like we have pushed it to the very last minute to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3254)|
| 0:54:20| So just raising those additional points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3260)|
| 0:54:25| Chair recognizes Commissioner Raw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| Postponing something like this, and you said it earlier, normally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| I mean if somebody requests to have something postponed, it's a no harm, no foul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| I know that people have come up here today to hopefully have this heard and a decision be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3282)|
| 0:54:50| But effectively, a postponement doesn't allow them to move forward with anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3290)|
| 0:54:56| depending on what they come back in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| So I don't see the harm in postponing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| Chair recognizes Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| I agree with Commissioner Raw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| I think when somebody is trying to be innovative in this town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| and they're trying to develop something, build something, we need to give them the benefit of the doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3311)|
| 0:55:19| We need to let them have 30 days to see what they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3319)|
| 0:55:25| That's my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| Chair recognizes Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| This doesn't have anything to do with postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| but what do the sinkholes have to do with a sector plan amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3335)|
| 0:55:43| I guess that's a question of staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3343)|
| 0:55:48| Ms. Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| I guess I would lean on the previous governmental rezoning that occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3350)|
| 0:55:57| asking for this to go to RA zone district rather than an RB zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3357)|
| 0:56:03| particularly noting the increased density that could be built under RB zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3363)|
| 0:56:11| which, as we know, aligns with the medium density residential land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3371)|
| 0:56:20| I'm still lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| So the medium density residential land use classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| if we look at that in the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| says that densities above 12 dwelling units an acre should be within a fourth mile of transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3392)|
| 0:56:43| and they're also supposed to be served by sidewalks and on land with slopes less than 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3403)|
| 0:56:55| So, again, there's already a point to the topography issue as part of the location criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3415)|
| 0:57:03| for a medium density residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| The sinkholes are noted on the plats as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| So the RB zone district doesn't allow as much flexibility in creative environmental design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3430)|
| 0:57:18| So that's another reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3438)|
| 0:57:25| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| Okay. David Harbin, 4334 Paper Mill Drive here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| We got the staff recommendation, I guess, Thursday or Friday this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| but it was to deny for the RB in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| We respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| So what I'm asking for is 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| Let us go back and look at this and see if it makes economic sense for us to develop in the PR zone at five units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3462)|
| 0:57:49| which I think staff can recommend that that would be more in line with what they're saying is in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3469)|
| 0:57:55| So let us have 30 days to see if that makes sense that we can develop around the sinkholes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| and it still makes sense with us and our clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| So that's why we need the 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| I understand the RB zone is not something that staff wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| The sector plan change is something that staff does not want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| Okay. We understand that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| We're going to try to develop under the low density zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| So give me 30 days to look at that and to go over that with my client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| and then we'll either withdraw or come back next week or next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| Mr. Harbin, as an engineer, you can't build on top of the sinkhole anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| so I still didn't understand what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3510)|
| 0:58:35| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| Why would that be in the recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| I didn't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| I guess I won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| You can't build on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| That's a whole different matter, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| I move that we postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| Let me recognize Commissioner Selsota real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| I was going to make the motion to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3547)|
| 0:59:08| So we have a motion by Commissioner Graf, second by Commissioner Selsota,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| to postpone this item for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3558)|
| 0:59:19| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3559)|
| 0:59:20| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| Did you have anything you wanted to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| Well, I thought that it would be nice to be able to speak before a motion was to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| as this gentleman just got up and was able to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| Well, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| I mean, it doesn't hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3573)|
| 0:59:34| It doesn't hurt, but he wasn't come up here first, so I was up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| I'm not an attorney and I'm not a builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| I'm a resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| 5105 Catalina Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| Your name, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| Seth Grossman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| I live in a subdivision, Beverly Acres, long history in Fountain City in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3587)|
| 0:59:53| Over 100 homes in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| This property at the end of Tazewell or at the end of Shenandoah Road in Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| like the folks at Joshua Landing have been talking about, it's a very dangerous intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3600)|
| 1:00:07| I would invite anybody to come up there from 2 to 4 o'clock on any weekday and try it out for themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| and see if they would like to turn left on that road and adding an apartment complex like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| because obviously with sinkholes, the only way is to go up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| and there's nothing like that in this area or in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3621)|
| 1:00:26| So to say that this is something like Joshua's Landing would be a misrepresentation of what they're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3626)|
| 1:00:32| In this property, obviously there's nothing wrong with development and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| but to try to say that putting five or six dwellings on an acre is consistent with what is in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3637)|
| 1:00:45| I don't think that would be appropriate at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| So that would have been nice to be able to say before this was pushed on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| not to mention the accidents on Beverly Road in Tazewell Pike that you could add in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| not just on Shenandoah in there, in that area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| So I think you should strongly think about this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| I know you've already voted on it, but it would be nice as a citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| not an attorney or a builder, to be heard that represents over 100 homes in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| It's not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3669)|
| 1:01:10| There's no sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| It's just a bad place to think to put an apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3676)|
| 1:01:20| Next on the agenda is agenda item number 24, file 11SC21C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3680)|
| 1:01:26| This is a variance and concept plan subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3686)|
| 1:01:31| It's Ashton Point Subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| Applicant developer is Derek Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| Location, west side of Osdale Road, west of Buckingham Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| Acreage is 2.33 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| Zoning is RN1, single family residential neighborhood and HP hillside protection overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3704)|
| 1:01:52| Existing land use is a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| Number of lots, seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3715)|
| 1:01:56| We have one subdivision variance requiring planning commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3716)|
| 1:02:02| Staff recommendation, approve the variance because the site conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| restrict compliance with the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| and the proposed variances will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3729)|
| 1:02:14| The staff also recommends approval of the concept plan subject to six conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3734)|
| 1:02:20| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3740)|
| 1:02:24| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| Applicant, would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| Would you like opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| I think they go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| Come up to the podium, please, and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| And you have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3761)|
| 1:02:42| My name is Lee Hume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| I live at 6902 Haverhill Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3763)|
| 1:02:50| Actually, as far as opposition goes, we're not really opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| We've met several times now with the owner, Mr. Mentzer, and his engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3775)|
| 1:03:01| and we have had good conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3781)|
| 1:03:06| Our concern has been with stormwater management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| and the way the design will be to handle stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| that's going to be developed from the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| And then our other concern is with the intersection at Buckingham| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| and Van Ausdale, which is probably not this is in the setting maybe to address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3800)|
| 1:03:26| but maybe city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| But we do have a concern long-term with that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| and just want to be on the record that that does need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3811)|
| 1:03:37| And the other thing, the bigger issue, though, is the stormwater management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| It is part of the Ten Mile Creek watershed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| and the owner and the engineers are aware of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| and we know that it will be addressed later in the design phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| and we just want to be on record that they've agreed to work with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3833)|
| 1:03:58| during the design phase to protect the adjacent homeowners that are on the north side of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3838)|
| 1:04:04| as well as the West Hills Park and the watershed that goes past the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3844)|
| 1:04:12| and into the St. Andrews subdivision, which has experienced flooding over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3852)|
| 1:04:18| and it's a problem that does need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| And, again, that needs to be probably through city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| But we did want to be on the record that we are concerned about those two issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3864)|
| 1:04:29| but we're very happy to say that it's been a pleasure working with the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3869)|
| 1:04:35| and the owner, who is also a neighbor about a block away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| so he definitely has a direct impact on what he ends up doing as well as the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3879)|
| 1:04:46| So, again, maybe this sounds a little odd for us to be up here and saying that we don't really oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3886)|
| 1:04:53| We're happy to be able to work so well with our neighbor and the engineer on this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3893)|
| 1:04:59| and we're optimistic that this is going to end up being a good project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| and we'll be able to resolve any concerns we have with the stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3902)|
| 1:05:07| So that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| Thank you, Mr. Hamm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3909)|
| 1:05:16| I'm Derek Jones, 1020 William Blount Drive, Maryville, Tennessee, 37801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3916)|
| 1:05:22| I'm the project engineer, and as he mentioned, during the 30-day postponement period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3922)|
| 1:05:28| we met with the associations out there and had some good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| I know there are concerns with the storm drainage, and as he mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| I'll make sure they're involved as we go through the design process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| and try and eliminate any concerns that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| No other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=3947)|

| 1:06:41| These are three motions required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| We have variances, a concept plan, and a development plan with peripheral setback reductions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4003)|

| 1:08:09| Hi, I'm Matthew Brooks, 2306 Mission Hill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| I'm a resident of Massey Creek Subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| This will impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| Could you speak a little closer to the mic, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| Yes, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| Pull it to where you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| Or you can raise it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| You got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| You can raise the platform up a little bit if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4108)|
| 1:08:29| Can you hear me good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4109)|
| 1:08:30| Yeah, it's better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4110)|
| 1:08:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| This parcel was recently approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| I believe it was 18 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| There was opposition to that due to this section of Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| Road is two lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| It desperately needs to be widened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| Many years ago, it was planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| It was fought by the farmers in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| Unfortunately for everybody that's come to the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| that's now a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| Since that approval for 18 homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| they have bought a small strip of land between their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| and Mission Hill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| There was no use to that property unless he buys it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| and adds these five homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| So the problem we're having is his concept plan hasn't changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| except adding five homes and driveways and a detention pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4163)|
| 1:09:28| along Mission Hill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| There's zero creativity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| It has nothing to do with the original development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4172)|
| 1:09:40| He could go back and redo this plan to keep all the homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4180)|
| 1:09:45| within the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4185)|
| 1:09:46| There's absolutely no reason to add those five driveways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| on a boulevard entrance at Mission Hill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| The new homeowners, as you can tell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| will have to come into Mission Hill Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| turn around to enter their driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4198)|
| 1:10:03| Mission Hill Lane was specifically designed and built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| for Massey Creek Subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| It's boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| It was professionally sodded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| It's irrigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| It's lighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| The Massey Creek HOA pays for all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| It's a beautiful area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| It's what attracts people to Massey Creek Subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4221)|
| 1:10:26| Adding these homes and the detention pond right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4226)|
| 1:10:30| is going to severely impact that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| And he could easily change his design to keep it within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| his property and not on Mission Hill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4237)|
| 1:10:42| Other than that, there are 39 comments in opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| and there's very good comments in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| so I hope you've had time to look those over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| The other issue with this parcel is along Hardin Valley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4253)|
| 1:11:00| again, it needs to be widened, and asking for these setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4260)|
| 1:11:04| after he has purchased this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| there's no contingencies, so he knew what he was getting into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| You're asking for a setback on Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| and a setback on Mission Hill to jam-pack these homes into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| and I ask you to consider it and deny this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4277)|
| 1:11:22| pushing back to the 18 that were previously approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| and letting them start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4290)|
| 1:11:35| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, here for the applicant, S&E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| This zoning was approved back in February of 2021| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| for up to three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| It was approved previously for use on review in September of 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| a unanimous approval by this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| for the previous concept plan of 18 homes on six acres, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4316)|
| 1:12:04| 6.98 acres, almost seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| Since that time, he has added another 1.87 acres along Mission Hills Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4326)|
| 1:12:14| and this revised use on review and concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4334)|
| 1:12:18| contemplates developing that additional acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| It was already zoned planned residential three dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| so the overall density impact is the same as what was before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4344)|
| 1:12:31| The three variances they were asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| are the same variances that were approved previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| except that one of the variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| regarding the minimum intersection separation between Mission Hill Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| and the driveway that comes off of Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| is actually reduced from, we'd asked for 368, 343 feet before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4368)|
| 1:12:56| and now it's 368, so we've been able to improve that site distance by 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| The largest area of concern is the access off of the boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| and it strikes me that the boulevard entrance there in Mission Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4385)|
| 1:13:09| has a median that has a break in it about midway through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| There's no other reason to put a break in the median| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| unless there was some contemplation that there would be some access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4394)|
| 1:13:18| between the two to access the property to either the right or the left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4398)|
| 1:13:23| of Mission Hills Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| Otherwise, the median would not be needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| so they were thinking ahead with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| Now, accessing private driveways off of a boulevard entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| is not prohibited by the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| It doesn't require a variance or any type of special approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4418)|
| 1:13:42| other than the use on review approval we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| And I think Mr. Reynolds was asked this question directly on Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4424)|
| 1:13:49| and answered it from his experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| It's not uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| You do see private driveways that are accessed off of boulevard entrances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4433)|
| 1:13:59| where they have to either cross the median| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| or they have to go back up and come back down to be able to enter their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| Just quickly looking around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| I was able to locate two very prominent examples of this for Westmoreland State| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4448)|
| 1:14:14| and Sequoia Hills where you have very high-end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| very prominent homes that have their access off of a boulevard entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4457)|
| 1:14:23| where they have to access it the same way that's proposed in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| So that may be something that many people haven't considered before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4467)|
| 1:14:33| but it's not uncommon and it's certainly allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| So we respect staff's recommendation on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| The impact, any additional impact is minimal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| given the density was already allowed at three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| And I would ask that you approve this per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| You have an additional comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4495)|
| 1:14:56| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| So the subject properties he's brought up with Westmoreland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| about this as being uncommon, that is correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| but those neighborhoods are built for that setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4503)|
| 1:15:07| This was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| As you can see, they're putting houses back-to-back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| and jamming those into that property to get the most out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| It's not designed like Westmoreland and the others that look well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4516)|
| 1:15:22| This does not look well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| It's a piece, it's right at the exit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| and the bricked sign for Massey Creek subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4527)|
| 1:15:31| is right there in the median at Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4531)|
| 1:15:35| And then there's a long drive up to the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4535)|
| 1:15:39| It's lighted, maintained, everything by the HOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4539)|
| 1:15:44| Even though it's a public road, we get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| It was still designed and approved for Massey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| And if he can redo his subdivision to stay within his property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4551)|
| 1:15:55| it would easily be possible to allow a tree buffer line to separate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4555)|
| 1:16:00| There's no reason not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4565)|
| 1:16:09| I was struck by the number of persons commenting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4569)|
| 1:16:16| that they really weren't commenting on the houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| or the number of new houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| They were really commenting on the lack of elegance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4582)|
| 1:16:29| to how the driveways are intersecting with Mission Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4589)|
| 1:16:35| And I think it's a reasonable request as part of our review of this concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4595)|
| 1:16:41| to say, you know, could we do something here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4601)|
| 1:16:45| It's a small ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| and I think that it would be helpful for traffic patterns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| for the residents, and for the desire of the existing residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| to maintain the look of their division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| to allow the developer to take another crack at how does that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4623)|
| 1:17:08| how do those five driveways actually function?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| And I am not the person to decide what that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| nor do I feel like it's good for this body to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| and quickly put that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| We tried to do that last month with a playground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| and that didn't go over so well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| So I would like to propose that we send this back to the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4645)|
| 1:17:31| to rework those five driveways in a manner that does not put them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| coming out directly onto Mission Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4656)|
| 1:17:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| Chair recognizes Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4661)|
| 1:17:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| An observation and a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| If you follow Mission, I'm looking at overall right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| if you follow Mission Hill Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| there are several houses on up the road that actually do have driveways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| that come out onto Mission Hill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| I don't see a huge problem with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| but my question would be, my fellow Commissioner said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4687)|
| 1:18:14| Mr. Mullins, would there be a way to have those five houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4694)|
| 1:18:21| with one access to Mission Hill Lane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| Would that be something that's possible to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4703)|
| 1:18:29| I think we have someone here from the applicants engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| that has looked at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| and there's a reason why that can't be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| Aaron, if you want to comment on that, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4716)|
| 1:18:45| Aaron Gray, 10330 Hardin Valley Road, Suite 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| We're with the Fulgham McIndoe Engineering Firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| We've been involved with the owner on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| So one of the original asks that we got involved with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| with the engineering staff and with the MPC staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| was looking at the access coming off of Mission Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| The problem with the access off of Mission Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| is that elevation is about 30 feet lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| than the Mission Hills property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| So in order to actually get the road up onto this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4750)|
| 1:19:15| you would basically have to carve the entire property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| down to the Mission Hills elevation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| which would effectively make the property useless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| I mean, you would have to cut the whole property down 20 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| which would make then the properties on the back side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| on the south or the west side of the property ineffective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4770)|
| 1:19:34| You couldn't build those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4774)|
| 1:19:35| because they would have enormous slopes on the back of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| So that was the hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| When we did look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| when we were going through the design process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4781)|
| 1:19:45| But you'll still have that same issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| if you put in five driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| They'll still be very steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| So the way that we've got it designed right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| is that those properties would be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| flat down to the elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4796)|
| 1:19:57| So you can see the grading there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| We've tried to minimize the amount of cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| that we would have to do on those five properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| in order to maintain the ability to have the lots above it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| and the lots below it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4808)|
| 1:20:09| Otherwise, we would have had to cut it even deeper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| than we already are on the current grading plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| that we've submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| Is there an alternate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| Is there any other consideration that you could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| in maintaining your density here between the properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| without driveways on the Mission Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| You would not be able to maintain the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| in keeping those five units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| You wouldn't be able to keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| So effectively, the five units would go away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| if you don't have driveways going out on the Mission Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| So what is the elevation of the five lots there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| and the elevation of Mission Hills Lane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| I have to look at my elevations on my map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4857)|
| 1:21:06| So the elevation of Mission Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| obviously it drains from Hardin Valley down toward the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4868)|
| 1:21:13| It starts out at about 867, finishing at about 860| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4873)|
| 1:21:17| as it goes down the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| So those lots would be relative to the road elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| So we would cut them down generally to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| I mean, they would be obviously, the house seats would be above it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| but the lots would be cut down to that elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| Then the elevation of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| the new road that comes in off of Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| it peaks out at about 892, so it's about 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| Would you be able to put like a frontage road in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| I mean, I'm not saying a road, but a drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| like a 10-foot drive that would serve those five lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4908)|
| 1:21:51| that would come out at the median break there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4911)|
| 1:21:57| At the cut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4917)|
| 1:21:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| So from a horizontal standpoint, I guess you could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| but you would run into the same problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| is in order to put the frontage road there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| you would continue to push the house seats further back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| and just deepen that cut as it moved to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| But how much right-of-way do you have in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| between the lots and the road of Mission Hills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4937)|
| 1:22:23| How much right-of-way, the existing right-of-way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| Yes, the existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4946)|
| 1:22:27| I don't know what the dimension is on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| Probably currently it sits at about maybe 80 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4950)|
| 1:22:34| and it would be part of the reason that the houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| or the lots are offset in the manner that you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| is just based on the configuration of the other lots on the new Road A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4960)|
| 1:22:46| We just staggered them in order to get depth on those lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4966)|
| 1:22:50| in order to create a house seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| So the total lots themselves will range from 125 total to 150 total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4974)|
| 1:23:00| something like that, 130 total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4980)|
| 1:23:04| Chair recognizes Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| Commissioner Del Sol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| In looking at the PR text,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4992)|
| 1:23:17| I don't see this as an imaginative solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| to an environmental design problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| just placing the lots right there on Mission Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5003)|
| 1:23:27| I'm not a fan of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| I'm not a fan of the lots on Mission Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| all of their driveway access being on that same road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5013)|
| 1:23:37| Chair recognizes Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| I actually have a little bit of contrasting thoughts on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5020)|
| 1:23:45| because when I look at this without those houses on Mission Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5025)|
| 1:23:51| and looking at the topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| I'm seeing I don't know how many houses are in that row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5033)|
| 1:23:57| but those houses are facing the opposite direction of Mission Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5037)|
| 1:24:01| and they're up on a hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| And I think from an aesthetic standpoint, if that's a concern here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5043)|
| 1:24:07| it's going to be a lot less aesthetically appealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| when you're driving in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5051)|
| 1:24:12| to be looking up at the backside of these houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5052)|
| 1:24:16| A lot of times they'll put more detail on the front of the houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5056)|
| 1:24:21| whereas the back will have less detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| and you'll see fences and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| So I know that a lot of the discussion is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| the actual driveway entrances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| and I think that entering on the driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5071)|
| 1:24:34| like there was some reference to other neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| and really I think that the individual driveways are fitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5077)|
| 1:24:42| But I think from an aesthetic standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| having front facades facing Mission Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5084)|
| 1:24:48| is going to be a lot more appealing to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| as they're coming through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| rather than seeing the backside of the houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| that are on the cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5097)|
| 1:25:02| Chair recognizes Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5102)|
| 1:25:05| That's exactly what I was going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| that if you bring everything inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| and don't have access off Mission Hill Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| you're probably going to be looking at the back of the houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| So do you want to look at the back of the houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| or do you want to look at the front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| The other thing is I think we're proving once again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5127)|
| 1:25:31| we don't need to be designing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| We need to let them take a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| and figure out what they want to do with it, if anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| and hear it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| I move we postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| Commissioner Hagan, do you have your lights on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5150)|
| 1:25:54| We have a motion by Commissioner Graf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| seconded by Commissioner Adams to postpone item 26| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5156)|
| 1:26:01| for 30 days until the February meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5164)|

| 1:26:14| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5176)|

| 1:26:29| The applicant is S. Derrick Jones, Sterling Engineering, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5189)|
| 1:26:35| Location, southwest side of Everett Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| southeast of Yarnell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| Size of tract, 15.668 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5200)|
| 1:26:44| Zoning is PR planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| with up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| Proposed use, multifamily development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5209)|
| 1:26:53| Staff recommendation, approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| for a multifamily development with up to 224 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5215)|
| 1:27:00| subject to seven conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5220)|

| 1:27:26| Matthew Weaver?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| You're all good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5249)|
| 1:27:30| So your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5250)|

| 1:27:35| Maryville, Tennessee, 37801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5255)|
| 1:27:39| Again, I'm with Sterling Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| I'm the project engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| Really, the only discussion that I have is in the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5264)|
| 1:27:48| there were some recent changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5268)|
| 1:27:50| I think item number seven, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| if my memory serves me right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| which is the addition of the pedestrian access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| along Everett Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5278)|
| 1:28:03| In going through the, I think that came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| maybe a couple of days ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| hadn't had a great deal of time to look through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| but this project is for TDK Construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5290)|
| 1:28:14| who's out of Murfreesboro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| I think they've done several projects here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| one on Emory Road, a vintage Emory, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5298)|
| 1:28:22| They're very amenity and pedestrian intensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5302)|
| 1:28:30| I guess you might say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5310)|
| 1:28:31| They like to do things in a heavy way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| so any time we can do pedestrian access or sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5313)|
| 1:28:37| or things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5317)|
| 1:28:38| typically they're the ones that request that we do them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| whether they're required or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| In this particular case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5322)|
| 1:28:45| the ordinance that's referenced in item number seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5325)|
| 1:28:50| also has a section in there that references,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| it's actually D2, that references topographical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5333)|
| 1:28:58| there's a number of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| several of which we actually meet without question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5340)|
| 1:29:04| That area's got a, we've got about 2,300,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5344)|
| 1:29:08| nearly half a mile of frontage down Everett Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| which goes completely off of this page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| into things that we're not developing at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| So about half a mile of development area there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| you can see the long run of Everett Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5360)|
| 1:29:24| Steep topography, you know, we've got walls in this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| that are running 25, 26 feet to get the site in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| as far as height goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| We've got a pipe dumping off the interstate, 36 inch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5374)|
| 1:29:38| with all the interstate water that we're creating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| more defining the roadside ditch down Everett Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5381)|
| 1:29:44| There's a gas line there, power poles there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5384)|
| 1:29:46| all of the things that you would normally have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| but to try and create an access down that drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5388)|
| 1:29:52| for that length of drive is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| to say it's costly would be an understatement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| I think maybe not even possible, I'm not sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5398)|
| 1:30:02| but, you know, in talking with the owner, the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5402)|
| 1:30:07| certainly granting an easement, he's open to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| if anybody ever wants to build it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| the other side is maybe a better place to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| but that's not his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5414)|
| 1:30:17| But with that being said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| I wanted to kind of address the number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5419)|
| 1:30:20| I know it just came up a couple of days ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| I think it got added yesterday or today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| to the report when it was revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| It's just, that's a difficult, difficult thing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5429)|
| 1:30:34| for anybody that's passed that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| just purely from a topographical standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| And looking through the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| we've submitted some preliminary drawings to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| and had a review by Leo at Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| That didn't come up, and I suspect it probably didn't come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5447)|
| 1:30:51| because he realized that the drainage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| and the topography in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| was going to make that quite tricky to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| So I would just ask that some consideration be given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| to item number seven as it's discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| Obviously, as we go through permitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| that can be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5468)|
| 1:31:09| I just would prefer not to, if possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| not to be locked into any specific thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5477)|
| 1:31:18| Yes, I'll just say a couple words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| and I'll probably ask my colleagues at EPW to weigh in as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| As you noted, there is a section D in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| that does state that the Director of Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| may modify the requirements of this section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| under certain circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| And so I'm sure that that would be a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| that could be had in the next phase of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5499)|
| 1:31:43| But Aaron, I believe, is on Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5503)|
| 1:31:47| I don't think we have anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| Unless, Mr. Elliott, can you speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5509)|
| 1:31:56| Yes, Steve Elliott, 205 West Baxter, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5516)|
| 1:32:00| One thing that I was texting with Jim here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5520)|
| 1:32:03| we could maybe ask is they could talk with TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5523)|
| 1:32:06| and maybe try to put their greenway up in TDOT's right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| to avoid the Topo along Everett Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5533)|
| 1:32:14| We could just put the condition in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| and then work with them at permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5536)|
| 1:32:17| on where the greenway is located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| and if it is a hardship, eliminate it at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5539)|
| 1:32:24| Thank you, Mr. Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5544)|
| 1:32:28| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| I have a question about the TDOT right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5550)|
| 1:32:34| Directing that to Mr. Elliott?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5554)|
| 1:32:35| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5555)|
| 1:32:36| I have a quick question about the TDOT right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| that you were referencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| If it was to run along the TDOT right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5560)|
| 1:32:44| how far is the TDOT right-of-way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| I think if you look on the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| you can see their property is kind of pie-shaped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| and then the right-of-way from TDOT steps out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| and goes over to and maybe even incorporates Everett Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5575)|
| 1:33:00| the other way on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| I'm trying to follow you on the screen above you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| Their property ends there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5585)|
| 1:33:06| and then all of that is TDOT right-of-way there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5586)|
| 1:33:10| Whoever's got the cursor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5590)|
| 1:33:11| if you can kind of put it where the TDOT right-of-way is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| Yeah, right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5594)|
| 1:33:15| That's all right-of-way for TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| And then the greenway we're trying to access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| is on up underneath the bridge in the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5599)|
| 1:33:25| So the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5605)|
| 1:33:26| The greenway, there's the greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5606)|
| 1:33:27| that we're trying to access with the trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5607)|
| 1:33:32| So would the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| If we utilize the TDOT right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| would it essentially be in a similar position as the greenway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| Yes, I would think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| As you can see, the greenway on the other side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| is in the right-of-way of TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| Everett Road, the topo is very steep, I agree with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5628)|
| 1:33:51| and it would be difficult to put it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5631)|
| 1:33:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5638)|
| 1:33:59| Do you have any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5639)|
| 1:34:00| Well, yeah, I guess I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5640)|
| 1:34:03| Just to kind of keep the order of business straight in my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5643)|
| 1:34:07| Farragut has said yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| that they are doing their portion of this greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5649)|
| 1:34:15| All entities have said yes except for the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| The developer is saying he's concerned about the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5658)|
| 1:34:22| and the topography, but there's an option that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5662)|
| 1:34:27| once it actually gets to the point of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| TDOT easement or TDOT right-of-way could solve that problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5671)|
| 1:34:36| and so there still would be a greenway pieced together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| for all three entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| Did I track correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| Potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| There's some things that obviously would need to be worked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| and TDOT's not been part of the conversation yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5688)|
| 1:34:51| So let's just go down that path for a quick second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| TDOT says no, you cannot use our right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5694)|
| 1:35:00| What then happens for the developer's responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| for this greenway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| Well, I think there is a mechanism in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| where the county can say it's just not practical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| and we're not going to obligate you to installing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5712)|
| 1:35:16| and I think that's the problem on Everett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| Is that correct, Mr. Elliott?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| Just topography just doesn't work to put a greenway along that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5720)|
| 1:35:24| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5724)|
| 1:35:25| They would have to grade way back up into their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| to get the topo to install the greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| because it would have to meet ADA requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| So, you know, could language in item number seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5733)|
| 1:35:38| maybe eliminating the frontage of property adjacent to Everett Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5738)|
| 1:35:43| and just put a pedestrian facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| as required by county commission ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| and not specifically eliminate the reference to Everett Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| I guess that's just a comment for you and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| If Everett Road is that much of a challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| then we probably need to eliminate that from consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5760)|
| 1:36:04| I'm just throwing it up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5764)|
| 1:36:09| I think it would be appropriate if you wanted to strike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| along the frontage of the property adjacent to Everett Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| and leave it more open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| Yes, and you could put language of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5776)|
| 1:36:19| location determined by county permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| Sorry, I'm thinking about more solutions or ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| but if there's a clause in there that basically excises one little portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5789)|
| 1:36:36| because of the difficult terrain, can there still be an easement there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5796)|
| 1:36:43| so that while it may not be a codified greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5803)|
| 1:36:49| there's still some type of trail or method for a mountain bike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5809)|
| 1:36:55| or something to get through there, or is it just blocked off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| So you still end up with just no passage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5818)|
| 1:37:04| My understanding of what we're trying to accomplish is still get the connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5824)|
| 1:37:08| for the greenway for the town of Farragut, but not along Everett Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5828)|
| 1:37:14| because it's just that it doesn't sound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| based on what we're hearing from the engineer and from Mr. Elliott,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| it's not practical based on the topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5839)|
| 1:37:24| And we're totally fine with putting an easement on all of the drawings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5844)|
| 1:37:28| and doing an easement that can be recorded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| that would be for a future greenway if that can ever be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5851)|
| 1:37:36| I mean, maybe at some point there may be road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| or something along Everett that would allow that to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| and the developer is totally fine with dedicating that easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5861)|
| 1:37:45| plenty of an easement, that would allow for that in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| without having to obtain right-of-way or easements at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| I mean, that's not a problem at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5871)|
| 1:37:57| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5877)|
| 1:37:58| I'll try to be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5878)|
| 1:38:01| I left before this meeting was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| I probably need to turn my button off so I can pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5883)|
| 1:38:08| My question is actually kind of a legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5888)|
| 1:38:12| Can we take Item 7 out legally because it's required by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5892)|
| 1:38:20| ordinance, the county commission ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| So it seems to me like we can't take it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5903)|
| 1:38:27| We're not taking it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| But there's also in the ordinance, she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5909)|
| 1:38:34| that engineering can actually modify this during the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5914)|
| 1:38:39| So effectively, even if we left it just like it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5919)|
| 1:38:46| engineering can come back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| well, they can't build it that way under ADA rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5928)|
| 1:38:52| And real quick with your talking about the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5932)|
| 1:38:56| I think right-of-way is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| I don't think we can approve something that's not ADA compliant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5938)|
| 1:39:03| today on anything like that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5946)|
| 1:39:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5947)|
| 1:39:13| Is there a motion by a member of the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5953)|
| 1:39:17| If there can still be qualifier language, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| put into Number 7, it can still be adapted to allow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5960)|
| 1:39:25| to recognize that ability by engineering to make that adjustment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5965)|
| 1:39:31| rather than an affirmative requirement that these go across the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5971)|
| 1:39:34| of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5976)|
| 1:39:37| I can read out what was stated and you all can modify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5977)|
| 1:39:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5981)|
| 1:39:42| Installation of pedestrian facilities to be determined during permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| as required by County Commission Ordinance Chapter 54,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| Article 4, Section 5481.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5989)|
| 1:39:56| I think just that would need to be part of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=5996)|
| 1:40:00| I'd like to make a motion that we approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6000)|
| 1:40:02| for both family development up to 224 development units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6002)|
| 1:40:05| subject to the seven conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| and modifying condition Number 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6007)|
| 1:40:10| taking out the requirement that the improvements be along Everett Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6010)|
| 1:40:15| Is that sufficient?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6015)|
| 1:40:16| Determined by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6016)|
| 1:40:17| To be determined by engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6023)|
| 1:40:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| All right, we have a motion by Commissioner Roth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| second by Commissioner Celsio to approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6027)|
| 1:40:31| for 224 dwelling units subject to seven conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6031)|
| 1:40:36| as modified per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6040)|
| 1:40:41| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6041)|
| 1:40:42| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6044)|
| 1:40:45| Thank you, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6045)|
| 1:40:46| Thank you, Mr. Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| Next is Agenda Item Number 35, File 1D22-SU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6048)|
| 1:40:53| This is a vehicle repair service establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| Staff is recommending a 30-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6056)|
| 1:41:01| The applicant is Stella Blue Ventures, LLC, Civil Logistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6061)|
| 1:41:08| Location, east side of Chapman Highway, south of East Young High Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6068)|
| 1:41:13| north of Woodlawn Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6073)|

| 1:41:25| Staff recommendation, postpone the request until the February 10, 2022| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| Planning Commission meeting as recommended by staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| pending additional information from the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| Is the applicant present, Mr. Mullins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6100)|
| 1:41:41| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6103)|
| 1:41:44| Mr. Mullins, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6106)|
| 1:41:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6109)|
| 1:41:51| This is a use on review for a Take 5 oil change at 4420-4418 Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6111)|
| 1:42:00| I understand, in working with Mr. Reynolds and staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6120)|
| 1:42:04| that the only outstanding issue to be addressed is the issue of access along the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6124)|
| 1:42:11| There is the neighboring property actually kind of wraps around our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6131)|
| 1:42:17| and we are showing on our plan part of that property be graded and to be used for access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6137)|
| 1:42:23| and queuing for the Take 5 service station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6143)|
| 1:42:29| There is an old easement that was reserved in the deeds from 1975| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6149)|
| 1:42:34| that reserves an easement for ingress and egress over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6154)|
| 1:42:38| and this is the exact language of the deed, the paved portion of Track 2A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6158)|
| 1:42:42| which is that area that wraps around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| It was not very clearly defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| There is an old, looks to be a plaid, although I don't think it's to scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6166)|
| 1:42:51| that has an arrow and a line drawn across the top, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6171)|
| 1:42:55| presumably to reflect where that easement is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| If you look at the historical aerials, that area of pavement probably has changed a little bit over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6178)|
| 1:43:04| so it's not very clearly defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| But I understand other than the issue of whether or not we have permission from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6186)|
| 1:43:11| and there's no opposition from the adjoining property owner to use this property in that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6191)|
| 1:43:16| that this otherwise would meet the requirements for approval for the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6196)|
| 1:43:21| Mr. Zuckerman is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6201)|
| 1:43:22| He is the, I guess, the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6202)|
| 1:43:25| It's owned by a general partnership, but a representative of the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6205)|
| 1:43:29| We are working on finalizing a specific agreement that would allow us to use it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6209)|
| 1:43:34| That hasn't been completely memorialized, and there's still some outstanding details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6214)|
| 1:43:39| He can confirm that with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| But what we're asking today, since there's no other issues to hold up approval for use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6221)|
| 1:43:47| we have some due diligence periods that are expiring quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6227)|
| 1:43:52| we'd like to ask you to approve this contingent upon there being some memorialization of an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6232)|
| 1:43:59| or there's no objection from the property owner prior to any permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6239)|
| 1:44:03| That way we would have assurances we can move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| we can continue to work with Mr. Zuckerman and nail down exactly what this looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6246)|
| 1:44:11| But he knows more about the negotiations than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6251)|
| 1:44:14| He can confirm that we're pretty close and just a few things to nail down beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6254)|
| 1:44:20| So if Mr. Zuckerman wants to comment on any of that, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6260)|
| 1:44:26| Hi, my name is Benjamin Zuckerman, 860 Johnson Ferry Road, number 140, Atlanta, Georgia, 303242.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6266)|
| 1:44:34| I represent Bayside TN Partnership, who's the owner of the bank building and the property right behind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6274)|
| 1:44:42| that's correct, and all the property behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6282)|
| 1:44:46| I just wanted to confirm that I have spoken to the applicant and we have verbally agreed to terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6286)|
| 1:44:54| and we're just going to finalize our paperwork with us and the bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6294)|
| 1:45:00| who has also agreed, who I've had discussions with previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6300)|
| 1:45:05| So all of that has been agreed to verbally, all we're now going to be doing is doing the paperwork for easement and memorialization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6305)|
| 1:45:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6315)|
| 1:45:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6316)|
| 1:45:20| With that, I'd ask for approval subject to that one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6323)|
| 1:45:27| I guess one of the questions I have for, I guess, our attorney is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6327)|
| 1:45:32| what legal document would we need in order to satisfy concerns of staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220113?start=6332)|
