| 0:00:29| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=29)|
| 0:00:36| I call to order this zoning meeting of the Knox County Commission for June 27 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=36)|
| 0:00:43| Madam Clerk, would you please call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=43)|

| 0:01:07| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=67)|
| 0:01:09| Commissioners, unless there is objection from the body, I would like to move item 75 to the front of the agenda, which is the ordinance on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=69)|
| 0:01:23| If there is no objection, Madam Clerk, please read item 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=83)|
| 0:01:25| It's O-22-6-104, amending the Knox County Code Appendix A, Zoning, Article 6, entitled Administration, Enforcement, and Interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=85)|
| 0:01:36| by amending subsection 6.40.01 and 6.50.07,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=96)|
| 0:01:43| and adding a new subsection 6.50.08 to provide for development plan appeals to a court of competent jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=103)|
| 0:01:53| This amends Ordinance O-9E-9-130, adopted September 10, 1990. This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=113)|
| 0:02:02| Thank you, Madam Clerk. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=122)|
| 0:02:05| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=125)|
| 0:02:07| Motion to approve by Commissioner Smith. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=127)|
| 0:02:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=129)|
| 0:02:10| Second by Commissioner Biggs. We have two individuals signed up to speak in public forum on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=130)|
| 0:02:15| I'd like to call Mr. Robert Thompson to the podium first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=135)|
| 0:02:20| Mr. Thompson, if you'll just state your name and county of residence, you have five minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=140)|
| 0:02:27| Yes, thank you. Robert Thompson, 8136 Jonesboro Road, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=147)|
| 0:02:34| I would like to be followed by Mr. Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| I appreciate the opportunity to speak against this proposal to reduce the BZA's appeal jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=159)|
| 0:02:46| I have three points. I'll try to be very quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=166)|
| 0:02:49| Point number one is I ask you to see this proposal for what it really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=169)|
| 0:02:53| It's a move to avoid appeals by citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| It's designed to reduce your constituents' voices in how our community is developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=177)|
| 0:03:03| Mayor Jacobs basically admitted as much in the May 16th work session when he said he doesn't even want to allow the two months that an appeal to BZA takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=183)|
| 0:03:13| In that same work session, the law director claimed it's just as easy for citizens to go to a chancellery court to appeal as it would be to go to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=193)|
| 0:03:23| But that is just not real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| And if it was true, then you would be saying, if you support that, that you prefer that appeals take years to resolve in court instead of a few months at BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=205)|
| 0:03:35| So I ask, are you really looking for more lawsuits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| You know, the existing rules and procedures are already a pretty high wall limiting your constituents' rights to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=219)|
| 0:03:48| In this proposal, it would add a really big brick to that existing wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=228)|
| 0:03:54| Point number two, why? It would be an unnecessary brick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=234)|
| 0:04:00| There has not been any real discussion, either at Planning Commission or here, of any actual justification for this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=240)|
| 0:04:08| Mayor Jacobs claimed that even two months being a problem to development, you know, that's purely speculative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=248)|
| 0:04:15| There's been no showing, no testimony at all, that BZA has ever really been a significant obstacle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=255)|
| 0:04:22| So this proposal is not based on any facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| And so what happens? So the law department has been tasked with coming up with a justification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=265)|
| 0:04:31| Point number three, let's look at that justification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| The law department's May 20 memo tries to argue that development plan review is a different thing from use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=276)|
| 0:04:44| and that all these years we've been mistakenly handling them under the same process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| Mr. Morey has kept using the word conflation to claim that we have failed to distinguish between these two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=289)|
| 0:04:56| But this argument has a, it's a fatal problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| It totally fails to mention the one clear provision in the PR zoning code that goes directly against that argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=299)|
| 0:05:08| It's in 5.13.15. It's up there on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| Now there's two highlighted sections there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| The first highlighted section is what Mr. Moyer cited in his memo, that there has to be an application for review of development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=315)|
| 0:05:24| The second highlighted section is what he did not discuss. He consciously omitted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=324)|
| 0:05:30| It says the application shall be in conformity with section 6.50, uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| I mean there it is. It's in black and white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| And this is actually, this is fundamental to the whole idea of how commission has intended all along for PR review to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=339)|
| 0:05:47| You know, PR, it's not your standard use permitted by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=347)|
| 0:05:53| It's a special thing. It requires this review. It goes under use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| So why in the world, why did the May 20 memo not get into this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=359)|
| 0:06:05| And I'm a lawyer myself, and I think that this is one of those memos that lawyers struggle to write when they know the answer their client wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=365)|
| 0:06:16| but the law and the facts are against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| It does happen, I understand it, but it's not right, and it's not a valid basis for you to take away your citizen's rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=379)|
| 0:06:26| So in conclusion, I ask, why would you slam the door on your citizen like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| What is the rush? Why are you doing this now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| Thank you, Mr. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| Next we have Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| Mr. Murphy, please state your name and county of residence. You have five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| Commissioner Smith, did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| Okay. Mr. Murphy, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| I'm speaking on behalf of the Knox County Planning Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| We oppose the proposed zoning ordinance resolution as it's currently written, and we ask that you vote no on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=414)|
| 0:07:01| Amending the zoning ordinance should only be done if there's a strong rationale for ending a longstanding practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=421)|
| 0:07:07| and for many reasons, Planning Commission decisions for use on review and development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| should remain locally appealable to the BZA rather than going to chancery court as proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| So what's the problem we're trying to solve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| And this is something that we ask, you know, what's the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| How do we get a good outcome?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| You know, how do we simplify and improve things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| So our understanding was that this is crafted and written with the perception that, first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| BZA isn't doing its job because they can't get a quorum or there aren't enough people there to get five affirmative votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=450)|
| 0:07:36| Secondly, BZA only approves everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| It's only overturned something once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| Third, everything gets appealed to court anyway, so BZA is kind of like an unnecessary step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| And then finally, that BZA isn't really trained or qualified to hear these types of appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| But unpacking that quickly, yes, BZA seems like they do have some challenges getting those five votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=469)|
| 0:07:56| and, you know, this resolution doesn't address getting them there for the other types of matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=476)|
| 0:08:03| like a variance that they hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| So we're missing that core problem that's being fixed first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| Secondly, BZA's upheld planning commission for 50% of the items since 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=491)|
| 0:08:19| So BZA affirmed 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| They modified a planning commission recommendation 31%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| That's five times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| And then twice, 12.5%, did BZA actually overrule the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=505)|
| 0:08:30| So BZA is 50% agrees with planning commission, but the other 50%, they take some other actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=510)|
| 0:08:37| Third, these don't always get appealed to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| There's been 16 appeals filed since 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| There's been five that were appealed to court, so that's 31%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| The other 69% were resolved at BZA and did not proceed any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| And that's a lot faster than going to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| All the ones that went to court took more than a year to resolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| The only thing this resolution would do to make things faster is if fewer appeals were filed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| because the appeals option to court is more cost prohibitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| And I hope that's not the driver to make it more expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| but that's certainly the perception of some people looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| And finally, on training and qualifications, the BZA members, they receive good training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| They get an agenda review meeting where they get good guidance from the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| It's similar guidance that the planning commissioners get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| The BZA members have full access to all the staff reports the planning commission has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| They have planning commission staff at their agenda review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| They have planning commission staff at the BZA meeting to actually give them advice on the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| So they've got all that advice and expertise available to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| So in front of you is a proposal that development plans should go to court, appeals should go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=584)|
| 0:09:50| And appeals to court is much more costly than an appeal to BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| and it simply makes it unaffordable to citizens and neighborhood groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| and thus, in effect, would probably end citizens' ability to appeal development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| We think it would be an unnecessary and poor policy choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| and it really sends a terrible message to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| An appeal to BZA, it takes less time than an appeal to chancery court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| and less time spent is both good for the applicant and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| And finally, BZA operates with broader authority to reweigh the factual evidence and arguments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=616)|
| 0:10:23| KCPA, one of the things that we hope that we do is we focus on simplifying and improving the processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=623)|
| 0:10:31| There's three root causes we think could be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| First is zoning ordinance language, particularly around the planned residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| and that's what planning commission focused on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| and that's what their resolution was about was development plans and planned residential particularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| We think PR, they started that process last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| and KCPA would really like to see that restarted because it's got vague language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| You can read it in the handout that I gave you if you look in the PR section, but that's problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=656)|
| 0:11:02| And that is where you see almost all the zoning items come to you for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| so if you update PR, that will solve a lot of our issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| The second root cause that we see is the short six-day window| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| between when a development plan is made available to the public on the planning commission site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| and then when the planning commission meeting happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| That's the six days that you've got to jump, run through a lot of hoops, coordinate, digest it, and do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| and it's just not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| And that is, you say that, well, you get six days, and then planning commission hears it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=688)|
| 0:11:34| and then your only avenue is to appeal to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| That further reinforces that this is a processing rig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| And finally, maybe we should consider minimum attendance requirements for appointees to any boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=701)|
| 0:11:48| because one of your challenges is BZA commissioner attendance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| and maybe there needs to be something that would actually set up grounds for removing an appointee to a board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| if they didn't attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| So thank you for your time, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| Commissioner Smith, your line is on, and then Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| I have three people I want to ask questions of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| First, I want to start with Director Snowden from EPW.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| Director Snowden, can you enlighten us a little bit about zoning, use by right, use by review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=737)|
| 0:12:24| what's wrong with the current ordinance, what changes this change to the ordinance makes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=744)|
| 0:12:32| and EPW's position on the ordinance that's before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| Yeah, I'll be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| I'll try to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| We, for many years, have struggled with, I guess, the interpretation of the PRs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=761)|
| 0:12:47| talking about PR zones specifically, because single-family homes are uses by right in that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=767)|
| 0:12:55| So I think we've always kind of struggled with why the use on review process was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| This process obviously clarifies that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| There's nine zones in the zoning ordinance that contemplate development plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| and I think that's another thing, because you've kind of got uses by right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| uses on review and development plans, and all that kind of gets jumbled up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=792)|
| 0:13:18| And I think for us, after reading what Mr. Moyers has stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| that it gives really clarity for us, if that's the language this body chooses to adopt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=802)|
| 0:13:29| that we can have a better understanding of what is a development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| what is it appropriate for use on review or use by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=815)|
| 0:13:42| So from my perspective, from our department's perspective, we've looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| and we think it clarifies the zoning ordinance to the extent that we've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=827)|
| 0:13:56| Director Brooks with MPC, Knoxville Not Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| Same series of questions for you. Do you remember them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| That's questionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| Zoning, use by right, use by review, current ordinance, what's wrong with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=850)|
| 0:14:16| how you feel about the new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| And I also would like you to address the six days in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| When is this stuff actually available for the public to see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| Is it literally six days all you've got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| No, it's not. I'll start with your first set of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| I'll concur with Director Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| You know, the way that we have struggled at planning with the PR residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| and how it's been interpreted over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| I think that it's one of the zoning districts that has been amended over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=883)|
| 0:14:49| and maybe all the language hasn't been addressed to make it clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| you know, related to permitted uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| and it's very clear that there are uses that are not permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| and that are uses permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| So, again, I would concur with everything that Director Snowden stated about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| In terms of notice, we require applications to be submitted 45 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=903)|
| 0:15:09| before the planning commissioners meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| Our public notice goes out 30 days out from that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| Sometimes we do do a second add if we need to make any clarifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| That goes out 15 days in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| And then three weeks out we release what's called a preliminary agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| So it's what is going to be on the agenda, the order of the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| and anything that's been submitted by the applicant is available online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| And at that time most things that are relevant have been submitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| And for concept plans, development plans, there is a back and forth that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| So planning staff and Knox County staff review that, review it internally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| review it with the applicants, and so sometimes there are requests for revisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| and so we are waiting for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| Those are required 12 days out from the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| so staff has enough time to draft their staff reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| In addition to the preliminary agenda, we also send out postcards two weeks in advance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| and then there's signs that are posted on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| and those are required a minimum 12 days out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| And the Knox County, Knoxville Planning, I got that backwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=972)|
| 0:16:20| their position on this ordinance as written?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| They did recommend approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| They did have a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| That was MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| I'm sorry, Knoxville, Knox County Planning, the staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| Staff recommended, well, staff didn't send forward a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| We provided some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| We tried to provide our planning commissioners with enough information to make an informed decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| Okay, and could you try to explain a zoning happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1008)|
| 0:16:54| there are certain things that are by right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| and then there are certain things that can be done by review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| Could you try to explain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| I can try, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| So there are uses that are permitted by right in all the zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| There are some uses that can be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1027)|
| 0:17:10| and those need to go through an additional level of review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| to make sure that they are compatible with the surrounding development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| and they make sense in that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| So that is addressed on a location-by-location basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| Staff provides a recommendation that goes forward to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| and the final decision rests with the planning commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| So these development plans that come back, what they call use on review, to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1049)|
| 0:17:37| are really there to make sure they fit the subdivision regs and all the codes, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1057)|
| 0:17:44| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| Law department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| Sir, can you try to explain this the best way you can, why we have brought this forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| and what is flawed with the one we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| and how it will be enforced if this doesn't pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| I guess it's important to talk about what this ordinance does not do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| When this was first proposed, as I understand it, by the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| what was suggested was that the Board of Zoning Appeals be cut out of the use on review process entirely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1098)|
| 0:18:25| And in researching that and in looking and sort of doing a deep dive into the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1105)|
| 0:18:32| what I noticed, and frankly what I was surprised about when I found out what was happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1112)|
| 0:18:39| because in my previous incarnation in this job, the BZA normally did not hear these kinds of appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1119)|
| 0:18:46| The BZA was pretty much limited to doing variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1126)|
| 0:18:52| Actually, the county commission was doing a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| But in any event, when I looked into it, I realized that there was a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1134)|
| 0:19:02| with the way I believe this ordinance had been read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| that there are uses, as of right, as has been explained, uses on review in each zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1146)|
| 0:19:13| and then there are development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| So, for example, using PR again as the example, because it's the one that's on everybody's mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1155)|
| 0:19:21| under 5.1, 3.02, you have a list of permitted uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1161)|
| 0:19:27| permitted meaning if you can do these without any other permission normally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| So there's accessory buildings, commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| Am I in the right zone? I may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| But then there's uses permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| Group daycare homes, assisted living facilities, adult daycare centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| These are things that have to have an extra level of scrutiny, as Director Brooks has pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| But then you have Section 5.13.15, which talks in terms of development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1191)|
| 0:19:58| Now, I don't want to go through all this again, because you all have had my memo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| and I'm happy to do it, but am I on? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| You've all seen my memo and what I've said about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| The Board of Zoning Appeals and the sections that talk about their powers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1211)|
| 0:20:20| reviewing development plans is not included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| The sections that talk about procedures for authorizing uses permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1223)|
| 0:20:36| That's 6.50. Let me start by saying this is sort of inside baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1236)|
| 0:20:41| We don't write these headings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| The headings for these ordinances are actually written by Metropolitan Code Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| So had I been writing this, I would have said procedures for authorizing uses permitted on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| and or development plans, because when you go into it, the second paragraph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| it talks about these development plans and the uses on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1257)|
| 0:21:03| shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| So obviously the drafters of this thought that these were two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| Otherwise, you'd just say uses on review. You wouldn't say development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| And then you go to 6.50.06, and it says the Planning Commission may approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| a development plan or use permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| Again, there's a distinction drawn between these two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| But when you go down to 6.50.07, where it talks about Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| review of actions of commission, the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| any person, firm, or corporation agreed by any decision of the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| relative to uses permitted on review may petition to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| So development plans are not included in that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| And one of the primary rules of statutory construction is you do not add things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| just because you think they ought to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| You have to assume that the drafters of the ordinance said what they meant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| and meant what they said. It's a matter of statutory construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| something I'm a little familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| So in looking at the code closely, my feeling was, and the reason I wrote the memo was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1322)|
| 0:22:08| that I believe that to achieve what I understood later that the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| was attempting to achieve, which was to streamline the subdivision process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| their goal really wasn't to remove, as I understood it, all uses on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| from the Board of Zoning Appeals purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| It was only really the subdivision process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| And the only place where you find that is in these development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| A subdivision concept plan currently goes straight to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1355)|
| 0:22:42| There's no intervening level of scrutiny anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| It goes directly to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| A concept plan is probably superfluous, but it's required in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1368)|
| 0:22:56| My reading of this code is that's what it does already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| And so this ordinance that's before you substantially reduces the reach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| of the original ordinance that was presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| It does not remove from the BZA the purview over all uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| In any zone where you see uses on review, you've got your permitted uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| and uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| Those uses on review will still go to the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| under this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| The only thing this ordinance does is clear up the distinction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| between development plans and uses on review and how they're dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| The only other thing it does is takes into consideration that in 1990,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1411)|
| 0:23:37| I think, the Tennessee Supreme Court said in a case dealing with Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| that the Knox County Commission did not have appellate authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| over planning commission decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| It was a case called BFI Industries versus Knox County Board of Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| And so my initial thought was, well, let's not do this thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1431)|
| 0:23:58| because it's still in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| 6.40 of the code still talks about appeals to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1439)|
| 0:24:05| Director Brooks pointed out to me that under current planning commission guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1445)|
| 0:24:12| if an applicant applies for rezoning and it's turned down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| they must appeal that to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| And the only place where that procedure is found is 6.40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| So this ordinance also amends that language to take out anything that would suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| that you could appeal a use on review to this county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| which I think is not legal under the current law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| but still allows for a party who's seeking a change in zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| an amendment to the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| There's one other instance to bring that to county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| which is what happens with every one of these things we're about to consider tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| I intend to have some more conversations with Director Brooks about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| because, frankly, I'm not sure that it's appropriate for the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1496)|
| 0:25:02| to be able to stop a rezoning request by voting against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| That's a legislative action, but we're going to work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| But in the meantime, all this does, this ordinance does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| is clarify the distinction between uses on review and development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| and sets forth how those things are reviewed once they're dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| I hope that answers any questions anybody has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1520)|
| 0:25:27| Thank you, Commissioner Smith, Mr. Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| Mr. Moyers, as a chancellor, judge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| Former.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| Former.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| Retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| Retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| Is that one in the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| Retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| I'm drawing a penchant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| I know, but is that a retired chancellor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| Retired chancellor, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| Can you help us better understand the court process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| Because that's been brought up several times of things getting appealed to the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| the price, the timeline, how those things are submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| Do you need a lawyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| Do you not need a lawyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| Can you help us kind of walk through and then how long does that take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| and how complicated is it, et cetera, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Ordinarily, if you're talking about appealing the actions of a body that's acting in a quasi-judicial capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1574)|
| 0:26:21| that means you've got a set of rules and regulations, you've got a set of facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1581)|
| 0:26:28| and the body is applying those facts to the preexisting rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| So, for example, if I want to build a subdivision, there are subdivision regulations set forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1592)|
| 0:26:38| When I bring my subdivision concept plan to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| they are applying the facts, my concept plan, to the preexisting rules, the subdivision regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1601)|
| 0:26:48| That is when a body is acting in a quasi-judicial fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| When that is the case, it goes up by what's called certiorari review to the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1613)|
| 0:26:59| The court is limited in its review to looking at the record that was developed in front of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1619)|
| 0:27:06| and determining whether or not the board acted arbitrarily and capriciously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1626)|
| 0:27:13| or without material evidence to support what it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| It's a very low bar, frankly, to overcome, or a very high bar for somebody who's seeking to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1636)|
| 0:27:23| because the idea is that body has already heard all the evidence, it's already had everything before it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| and it is not the place of the courts to substitute their view of what's appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1649)|
| 0:27:38| for that of the quasi-judicial body that is established to look at these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| So what happens is when a certiorari is appealed, we put together a transcript,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1664)|
| 0:27:51| or the MPC does, depending on who it's appealed from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| puts together a transcript of what happened in front of the body that's being appealed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1675)|
| 0:28:02| a transcript of the proceedings, all of the exhibits that were put before the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| and that is certified to the court within, I think, 60 days of the certiorari being filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1687)|
| 0:28:14| Then the parties have 30 days to file answers, and at that point the case should go to court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1694)|
| 0:28:21| because there's no further evidence that is to be adduced, there's no discovery to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1701)|
| 0:28:28| there are no depositions to take, it's basically judged, here's what happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| did the body have material evidence sufficient to support what it did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| And the court will look at that and go, yes it did, or no it didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| So to give you an example from a past life, this is when I was here, not when I was on the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| we had an appeal of an attempt to build a demolition landfill in East Knox County, as I recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1727)|
| 0:28:57| many, many, many years ago, and there were folks in the neighborhood who were against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1737)|
| 0:29:06| and they spoke very passionately against it, but what was not produced at the hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1746)|
| 0:29:14| was any evidence that the landfill did not meet the previously existing requirements for a landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1754)|
| 0:29:22| And so the county commission, I think, heard that appeal, they denied the landfill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| and when I went to court, and it was Judge Wimberly, as I recall, I lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| I lost because the body had no material evidence to support the action that it had taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1774)|
| 0:29:41| You don't have unlimited discretion to turn down a use when it meets the rules and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1781)|
| 0:29:50| that have already been put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| So normally a certiorari process is quick, but it depends on how much the court is backed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1792)|
| 0:30:01| it depends on how expeditiously the parties act to get it done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| and then of course if you go to the appellate process, if you're not satisfied with what the court does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1805)|
| 0:30:11| and you go to the court of appeals, then that slows down the process even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| We had a very nice lady who was here the first time this came up who talked about her five-year sojourn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| through the court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| That can happen, but it happened because this case went all the way, I think, to the Supreme Court on appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| and that takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| Thank you, Mr. Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| Mr. Murphy, you have a question, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1831)|
| 0:30:37| When this first came before commission, and I'm just going to say it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1837)|
| 0:30:43| this is really in the weeds government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| It's as dense as it gets when it gets to planning, land use, this appeal, that appeal, ordinances, courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1846)|
| 0:30:55| When it came to us the first time, I was a supporter of sending it to the planning commission to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1855)|
| 0:31:01| These are our subject matter experts, our staff, these are folks that deal with this every single day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1861)|
| 0:31:08| versus this commission that obviously has a different level of bandwidth and focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1868)|
| 0:31:14| My understanding is that that was a good process, and it was a good debate, it was good dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1874)|
| 0:31:22| What didn't come out of there that, I mean, I guess I'm asking what was not good about that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1882)|
| 0:31:31| that led to today that you're still in opposition of kind of where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| even after sending it down, hashing through it, having all parties at the table, planning experts, etc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| and then coming back to us with, you know, we really vetted this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| That's actually a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| So they looked at it and they vetted it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| and they focused on the development plans related to planned residential district or zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1913)|
| 0:32:01| The ordinance in front of you actually deals with development plans for a number of different zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| So the resolution in front of you is different than what planning commission resolved for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| So that's one discrepancy we've got in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| So they did one out of seven things, not all seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| Okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| That's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| The other thing is there wasn't really a robust discussion about, in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1940)|
| 0:32:27| I'm going to go back to that planned residential zone because that's the one that causes all the tension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| and that's the one that we see over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| And if you look at what a planned residential zone requires for a development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| it says, you know, showing the use dimensions of, like, proposed streets, parks, playgrounds, school sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| other spaces to determine if the arrangement makes it desirable to apply the regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| requirements different from those ordinarily applicable because planned residential gives you some latitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1970)|
| 0:32:57| But there is nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| And then it says, you know, you'll look at the proposed development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| and recognize good principles of civic design, land use planning, and landscape architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1982)|
| 0:33:08| That is wide open, and that is why there is all this discussion that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| between applicants, staff, planning commissioners, and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| And we are all, you know, there's so much room for opinion there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| And that's the root of the issue is the development plan requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| When you have a development plan in planned residential, it's so vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| It doesn't say, do you have to have a park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| Do you have to provide a park if you aren't within a mile of a park or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| And that's why there's a lot of disagreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| And it takes, you know, and that's why there's a lot of, you know, there wasn't a discussion about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2019)|
| 0:33:45| and there wasn't really a lot of discussion, too, about that short time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| And I do want to say, so the preliminary agenda is out for the July planning commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| and I just pulled up a concept on Beeler Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| So there's an application in there that says I want to subdivide it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| and how many lots there are and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| And there is a traffic study, but there's no site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| so I can't tell is there a park or are there sidewalks, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| So now I'm going to have to go contact, you know, staff and try and get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| So it's going to take some time, and there's going to be a little bit more back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| between now and then, so really, you know, and then we don't know what issue staff is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| So there's still they didn't talk about that, and that's one of the key things, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| that really gets the community excited is it's really six days where you see that staff report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| and you understand what staff is thinking and what they kind of lay out the issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| and the community's got six days to try and digest that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| I ask the question because I struggle with a little bit of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| On everything we do as a commission, my first question usually is it legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| Are there rules and regulations that we're following the law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| People have a right to build, they have a right to their land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| and yet the community also has a right to have their say, but it doesn't always balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2095)|
| 0:35:02| You know, we're not the taste police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| I've said that so many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| It's not my job to determine if you want to buy that kind of house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| That's your choice in the free market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| So I struggle with this because I see both sides, but I ultimately always go back to, okay, what is the law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2112)|
| 0:35:19| What does the law say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| What do the rules say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| And less ambiguity is better, in my opinion, because opinions are not the same as rights, property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2123)|
| 0:35:30| So I'm struggling a little bit here, but I appreciate the conversation and the information, Mr. Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| Thank you, Commissioner Jay, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| This question is for Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| You provided a copy of this that was presented by Mr. Murphy at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2147)|
| 0:35:56| Did you give her, Mr. Murphy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| Yes, there's one sitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| I haven't had a chance to review it, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| If you follow along down where it says how to improve, number one, planned residential ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2162)|
| 0:36:08| is this something that would be handled through advanced NOCs within this next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2168)|
| 0:36:17| I don't think it's going to be handled through the advanced NOCs process, but it should be an outcome of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| So the next step after you have updated a land use and transportation plan is then you look at your codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| to make sure that they are positioned to actually implement the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| So that would be the next step is to look at your zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| And then number two, the short six-day window, on a typical NOCs planning agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2196)|
| 0:36:43| have you guys analyzed how many of those filings are missing the final development plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2203)|
| 0:36:51| I'll just tell you, I just looked up the Beeler Road one, and it's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| It's on our preliminary agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| So I just pulled up the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| In terms of analyzing which ones are missing, I know we haven't done that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| but I just checked a couple of them, and they came up for me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| So is there a percentage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| I mean, are 25% of the filings missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| What would your guesstimate be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| I would be shocked if that was the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| I'm happy to go back and talk to my staff, but they should be out three weeks in advance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| what was submitted by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| And then as they are revised, they are uploaded to our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| I will say that there's typically not significant revisions on what they're proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| and if they are, they're usually postponed to the next agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| And then my last question is to Director Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| If you'll look into number three on the agenda there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| there's nine district commissioners that are responsible for the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2264)|
| 0:37:51| representatives that represent each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| And since you're the ultimate director of the codes department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| it would help us to know that if somebody that is our district representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2280)|
| 0:38:06| on the Board of Zoning Appeals is not attending the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| Otherwise, we have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| Because there is nothing that comes back from the manager of the BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| or the codes department that says District 7 is never showing up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| District 9 is never showing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| But we need to know that because then we need to take action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| and get someone in that spot within the next 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| And we've actually discussed that exact topic at a recent BZA meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| and it's my understanding the chair of the current BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| is going to be sending a letter to this body about some absence of particular members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2319)|
| 0:38:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| We do have a proper motion before us to approve this ordinance on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| That motion is by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| The second is by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| It's an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=2343)|

| 1:02:05| planned residential PR zoning for it. The tract does have some challenges to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=3725)|
| 1:02:13| namely topography. It also has some streams on it and as such we came in requesting PR3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=3733)|
| 1:02:21| three units an acre zoning, despite three and even four being precedent all around the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=3741)|

| 1:03:26| at planning commission we decided to agree to staff's recommendation of two units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=3806)|

| 1:06:52| but it was developed over a significant amount of time and effort and energy and study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4012)|
| 1:06:59| to allow the developers and the commission to allow that to guide their policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4019)|
| 1:07:07| It includes a green infrastructure plan that quotes, that directs the planners to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4027)|
| 1:07:13| balance development and conservation and to preserve open space and natural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4033)|
| 1:07:21| A significant portion of this property, over 34 acres of the 59 acres is governed or is covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4041)|
| 1:07:29| by the hillside overlay, the hillside protection overlay. That plan calls for, quote, development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4049)|
| 1:07:35| policies to encourage low density residential development on steeper slopes. And the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4055)|
| 1:07:41| is to reduce density, not increase it. The land use clarification for rural residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4061)|
| 1:07:49| is areas characterized as forested or tree covered, especially on moderate and steep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4069)|
| 1:07:55| slopes, end quote, and that's exactly what this property is. And the recommended zoning density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4075)|
| 1:08:01| for that type of property is densities of one dwelling unit per acre. So when people talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4081)|
| 1:08:09| about the comparison or the current development of Hardin Valley, there's a significant difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4089)|
| 1:08:15| between what is on the south side of Hardin Valley Road and what's on the north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| And if you look at the map, all the areas on the south side of Hardin Valley Road where this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4100)|
| 1:08:25| property is located remain primarily rural residential or agricultural because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4105)|
| 1:08:31| topographical constraints. And that's identified in the case that's brought before you. The areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4111)|
| 1:08:38| on the north side of Hardin Valley Road, there's significant higher density because that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| the plan calls for. The plan allows for areas to be higher density because the topography allows it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4122)|
| 1:08:48| and there's areas that are already designated for higher density that is not being utilized yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4128)|
| 1:08:54| And so it does not make good policy to increase the density on a piece-by-piece basis when it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4134)|
| 1:09:04| throws the entire plan of the northwest sector out of balance, when there's already areas that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4144)|
| 1:09:09| are designated for a higher density development. I would like to point out some specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4149)|
| 1:09:17| items that are conditions that are required to be met before an amendment to the zoning can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4157)|
| 1:09:26| accomplished. And that's included in the case that's before you. The proposed amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| must meet all of these requirements. It shall be necessary because this has substantially changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4171)|
| 1:09:39| or changing conditions in the area. And it's identified here that the forested steep slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4179)|

| 1:09:55| the development in this area have occurred primarily on the north side of the section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4195)|
| 1:09:58| of Hardin Valley Road because the topography is not challenged. And that is what was presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4198)|
| 1:10:03| to you by the Planning Commission recommendations. I do want you to hear us clear. We're not opposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4203)|

| 1:10:35| what the commission would prefer to do, then I would request a motion that would change it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4235)|
| 1:10:41| planned residential but limit the density to one dwelling unit per acre consistent with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4241)|

| 1:11:04| speak to you all this evening. As a citizen of Knoxville and resident of Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4264)|
| 1:11:09| like I said, my name is Leah. I've got a husband named Daniel and a four and six-year-old little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| boy is Colton and Carson. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention our 11-year-old Sadie dog that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4273)|
| 1:11:19| likes to hang around our cul-de-sac as well. We've lived in Knoxville for about 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4279)|
| 1:11:26| Our property line will be directly impacted by this proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4286)|
| 1:11:32| A couple of considerations I would ask you guys to think about. Some of them echo what Daniel said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| but land can only be developed once. It can only be developed once, so it's a critical moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4297)|
| 1:11:43| in any community when decisions are made regarding that land. It not only affects the folks in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4303)|
| 1:11:51| room, the folks in Hardin Valley, but it affects our generations to come, many of which that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4311)|
| 1:11:56| raising, our grandkids, our legacy, if you will, is affected by the way the decisions we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4316)|
| 1:12:02| I believe that's probably why there was a lot of thought and consideration in the Northwest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| Sector Plan that Daniel talked about. When you look at West Knox, one of the areas that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4327)|
| 1:12:14| stands out for its beauty and for being very well planned would be Farragut. I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4334)|
| 1:12:21| when you look at that, you say, well, what makes it pretty, driving through Farragut? It's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| greenways. You see people walking. You see people running. You see dogs out. You see that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4345)|
| 1:12:31| neighborhoods were built with very community-centric, if you will, with the community in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4351)|
| 1:12:37| With yards large enough for a pickup football game or soccer game or whatever it is that inspires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4357)|
| 1:12:44| family in each of those homes. The Northwest Sector Plan should be followed to preserve our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4364)|
| 1:12:50| community so that we too in Hardin Valley can inspire that same feeling. That is what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4370)|
| 1:12:58| community members and the residents of Hardin Valley want. We want to feel community-centric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4378)|
| 1:13:05| The area in question should remain zoned as rural at a maximum density of one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4385)|
| 1:13:14| As Daniel talked about, this is consistent with the majority of the property that borders that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4394)|
| 1:13:20| area. We've lived in our home for about two years, and we specifically looked and bought that home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4400)|
| 1:13:26| for that reason. You know, continually adding higher density requests piece by piece or ad hoc| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4406)|
| 1:13:34| seems to negate the validity of the Northwest Sector Plan as it would not be followed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4414)|
| 1:13:41| especially when, as Daniel said, there are already provisions in the plan for other areas that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| zoned for higher density. So I ask that you let the voice of the community and the voice of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4426)|
| 1:13:54| Hardin Valley community and the Northwest Sector Plan guide this process. Keep the land zoned at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| rural one unit per acre. If the zoning change is approved as the developer has requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4439)|
| 1:14:08| then I would request a motion to include the following. Preserve the natural forests and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| not clear-cut homes or not clear-cut the area to build homes. Plant enhanced vegetative barriers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4453)|
| 1:14:20| that match the current flora and fauna of the area. Offer a buffer area between the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4460)|
| 1:14:28| neighborhoods at a minimum of 100 feet, and add a neighborhood green space of at least five acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4468)|
| 1:14:35| to what is being built. That is also reflective of the surrounding area, as that is approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4475)|
| 1:14:42| what we have in community green space in our neighborhood, which we use every year to meet up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| and as a community to create community, right? We have Easter egg hunts. We have Halloween hay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4487)|
| 1:14:56| rides. We have movie nights. We have a pool. I mean, it's the definition of a community because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| we have this space. Because many, many years ago, our developers, 30, 40 years ago, that was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4501)|
| 1:15:07| priority to them. And they built that space, and now generations later, my kids and I are able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4507)|
| 1:15:13| use it because of their foresight. You know, just one final comment. My mom's actually here with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4513)|
| 1:15:22| So I've lived all over the country. I was born in Colorado, North Carolina, Michigan, Kentucky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4522)|
| 1:15:27| Washington, Tennessee, a quick stint in New Zealand. So I've seen communities all over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4527)|
| 1:15:34| country and all over the world. And I can't really think of an area I've seen with so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4534)|
| 1:15:41| potential. We have so much potential in Hardin Valley to make it what is just going to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4541)|
| 1:15:48| blessing for years and years to come. But these decisions are critical for that. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4548)|
| 1:15:55| I wasn't able to be at the last hearing. My husband was. But one person said, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4555)|
| 1:16:04| it, I've heard it, I've heard the same thing tonight, is it's not your responsibility to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4564)|
| 1:16:10| tell private citizens what you can do with their land. And that's true. I agree with that. But it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| is up to you all, as members of the community as well as our neighbors, to help know the strategic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4575)|
| 1:16:24| plan and be sure that that's followed and listen to the voice of the community or have the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4584)|
| 1:16:33| in mind so we can pave the way for generations to come because we have a beautiful, beautiful area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4593)|
| 1:16:39| Thank you for your time. Thank you, Ms. Beckworth. I want to give the applicant an opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| respond and then obviously open the floor for commissioners to ask questions or make comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4604)|
| 1:16:51| Thank you. So just to respond to a couple of points, the Northwest Sector Plan, I do have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4611)|
| 1:16:58| copy of it here and other zoning to consider. It does say that PR zoning and the growth plan's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4618)|
| 1:17:06| rural area with densities up to three units per acre or less have clustered in one portion of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4626)|
| 1:17:11| subdivision. And I think a point to make on that is that this property does sit on Hardin Valley Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4631)|
| 1:17:16| and it sits on Hardin Valley Road with several hundred feet of frontage. It is a very present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4636)|
| 1:17:23| piece of property right there directly in the center of the community. The other thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| I'll say is if you look at historical aerials of this property back as early as the 1980s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4647)|
| 1:17:33| there was over 30 acres of this property that was cleared and open and farmed. It was a working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| farm. And so, you know, those 30 acres that were farmed at one point are really where we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4658)|
| 1:17:45| concentrate our effort because it's the area that makes most sense to develop. But we have to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4665)|
| 1:17:50| with today's realities, which is land is expensive and development is expensive and density helps to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4670)|
| 1:17:57| mitigate some of those costs and helps to create some affordable or more affordable lots. That is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4677)|
| 1:18:05| what is needed. The other comment that was made was that a property is only developed once. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4685)|
| 1:18:10| I think there's some truth to that in that, you know, the development cycle is long. So once a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| property is subdivided or developed, it takes many years for it to change uses. And with that being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4694)|
| 1:18:21| the case, I think we, being a grown community and with so many people moving to this area from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4701)|
| 1:18:27| other places, there is a very real need for housing. And if we're going to develop a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4707)|
| 1:18:35| and start that process by rezoning, you know, areas and properties that warrant the growth and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4715)|
| 1:18:42| the develop need to be used wisely. And we need to use the areas, the land assets that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4722)|
| 1:18:48| that are developable, that are near center points of our community well because it will take many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4728)|
| 1:18:55| many decades for that property to be reused. Farragut was mentioned as a community, as a model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4735)|
| 1:19:02| community. Interestingly enough, we have close to 400 lots there as a company that we're currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4742)|
| 1:19:08| working on. We've developed probably more property in Farragut, Homestead Land Holdings, than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4748)|
| 1:19:14| anybody. So we understand, you know, the process. We understand what people want and what people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4754)|
| 1:19:21| need. And we want to keep creating that, not only in Farragut, but in Hardin Valley and other parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4761)|
| 1:19:28| of the county. So with that being said, those are just some responses to the points that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4768)|
| 1:19:34| brought up. Thank you, sir. Commissioner Jay, your line is up. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Kijewski,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4774)|
| 1:19:42| I'm noticing on the application and documentation presented by planning that there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4782)|
| 1:19:51| significant amount of this property that is 40 percent slope, 25 to 40 percent. I mean, it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4791)|
| 1:19:59| significant portion. And when I look at the aerials and I look at the maps, I mean, it seems to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4799)|
| 1:20:05| the wooded, you know, upper area. Is your intent with this development, I know we're not in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4805)|
| 1:20:11| use on review or, you know, the next step, but is the intent of this development to not go into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4811)|
| 1:20:20| that hillside? That's correct. Actually, there's 38.6 acres that are 25 percent slope or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4820)|
| 1:20:29| So of the 58 acres, 38.6 acres are 25 percent or less. And that's really where development should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4829)|
| 1:20:36| occur in that area. And so that's what we've been looking at. And even then, it's not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4836)|
| 1:20:42| throughout that entire 38 acres, but that is what we've been concentrating on. And can you address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4842)|
| 1:20:48| any of the, I know this happens more and more, the discussion of buffers and vegetation buffers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4848)|
| 1:20:55| between existing neighborhoods and or connectivity or green space. Can you, is there any plans for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4855)|
| 1:21:01| any of that? You know, that will really be designed at concept. And with planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4861)|
| 1:21:09| there is a periphery buffer around the development that is a piece of planned residential. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4869)|
| 1:21:16| you know, I think that's somewhat ingrained in the process, but being mindful of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4876)|
| 1:21:23| the concerns of the thoughts, you know, we would obviously consider doing vegetative buffers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| you know. But again, that's a concept and design element, not necessarily a zoning element.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4888)|
| 1:21:35| Thank you, Mr. Kujewski. Ms. Brooks, planned, traditional planned residential is up to three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4895)|
| 1:21:43| units, correct? Or is that a standard or is that just... No, it can be one, two, three, up to five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4903)|
| 1:21:51| or greater than that. Oh, okay. So it doesn't have a set... No, it's guided by the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4911)|
| 1:21:56| designation. Okay. So it's been on the second plan. Okay. So this particular sector plan sort of has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4916)|
| 1:22:03| the up to three, but the recommendation is two. Yes, that's correct. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4923)|
| 1:22:11| Those are my questions. Thank you, Commissioner Jay. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4931)|
| 1:22:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Snowden, have you had a chance to look at this track of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4937)|
| 1:22:24| as far as access to Hardin Valley with potentially of 115 homes? Would this tie in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4944)|
| 1:22:33| to like Brighton Farms Boulevard? So down in the future, you could do a traffic light there. Where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4953)|
| 1:22:39| do you guys envision the access to this property is? We haven't looked at it really close. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4959)|
| 1:22:47| obviously want to eliminate conflict points where left turns, you know, interlock potentially. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4967)|
| 1:22:53| I think the entrance to the Glen, is that near your home's property? There are two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4973)|
| 1:23:00| entrances on the opposite side of Hardin Valley Road, two different entrances that line up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4980)|
| 1:23:06| this property. So I think that from a design standpoint, we would consider trying to line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4986)|
| 1:23:12| up with those entrances, if at all possible. Yeah, so it sounds like they're kind of headed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| down the same path we would want. There's currently left turn lanes at both those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=4996)|
| 1:23:22| intersections. It's a three-lane section through there. So we would definitely want them to line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5002)|
| 1:23:28| up with one of those, if not both. Okay. All right, and then the other question I had just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5008)|
| 1:23:38| for the members of the public. Do most of you all live in the Chestnut Grove subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5018)|
| 1:23:45| Yes. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5025)|

| 1:31:07| last month I made comment that we did not need the close to five units an acre on that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5467)|
| 1:31:14| and so that we would acquiesce to PR at 4.5 units an acre. And so that's what the Commission decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5474)|
| 1:31:23| on. This particular property is adjacent to and will be developed as part of, or our plan is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5483)|
| 1:31:30| to develop the properties together as one project. And as such, the zoning discrepancy brings up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5490)|
| 1:31:37| some challenges for us. Namely, in design, as our engineer has been working on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5497)|
| 1:31:44| there will be lots that straddle what is the existing property line that will then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5504)|
| 1:31:50| in the future, go away. And so our challenge is, how do we design this if we have two different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5510)|
| 1:31:56| zonings, one on each property? So we've been working through it. Our engineer has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5516)|
| 1:32:01| working on design. We're not finished, to my knowledge, with it yet, but we've been working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5521)|
| 1:32:06| through it. This property, from a slope analysis standpoint, it warrants a 4.78 density, 4.78| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5526)|
| 1:32:16| units an acre. Our initial request was PR five units an acre. Again, we do not need five units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5536)|
| 1:32:25| an acre on this property, nor do we really need 4.78 based on what our engineer has told us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5545)|
| 1:32:31| So we would be willing to accept a PR at four units an acre, or PR less than four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5551)|
| 1:32:39| would be acceptable. We believe that the overall design of this property and kind of the limitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5559)|
| 1:32:45| of it would probably be less than that, even. But in order to help design the two properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5565)|
| 1:32:54| together, we are requesting a PR of less than four zoning on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5574)|
| 1:33:04| Thank you, sir. Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd say my 30 some odd years of doing this, I have never seen this happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5587)|
| 1:33:13| where we've got two pieces of property with two different zonings. So I thought, and Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5593)|
| 1:33:19| Brooks corrected me, and I didn't believe her. So I went to the wherever he's at, the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5599)|
| 1:33:27| and he confirmed what Director Brooks corrected me on. This line will never go away. It will be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5607)|
| 1:33:33| imaginary line there. So lot 58, parcel 58 will have the 4.50, parcel 58.06 will be what we decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5613)|
| 1:33:46| tonight. And talking with Tom and others, I can understand until the concept plan or the plan is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5626)|
| 1:33:59| developed, they don't know how far that law will extend over. So will that take away part of their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5639)|
| 1:34:07| say we approve tonight at 3.9, less than four. Will that 3.9 help when that on lot 58| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5647)|
| 1:34:18| is pushed over onto lot 58.06? Do you understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5658)|
| 1:34:23| So it's, I've never seen it. Have you ever seen it, Amy, that like this before, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5663)|
| 1:34:29| we have that imaginary line and two different zonings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5669)|
| 1:34:32| Yes, our staff had to deal with this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| The simplest way to do it is just go ahead, and I'm going to make the request at 4.9. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5675)|
| 1:34:44| think, or I'm sorry, 3.9, because I don't believe after it's all said and done, like Tom said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5684)|
| 1:34:52| I'm not going to say your last name, but I don't want to butcher it. But I don't think it's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5692)|
| 1:34:58| to be that high a density at all. I really don't. But until that plan gets together where that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5698)|
| 1:35:02| imaginary line is, they show this plan to the Planning Commission, we don't know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5702)|
| 1:35:10| So I will make a motion to approve at 3.9 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5710)|
| 1:35:24| I have a motion by Commissioner Daley to approve this rezoning at a density of 3.9 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5724)|
| 1:35:29| A second by Commissioner Durrett. Commissioner Skinner, your light is on, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5729)|
| 1:35:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5734)|
| 1:35:39| when we have back-to-back rezonings that first come through your agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5739)|
| 1:35:47| do you all have any rules, regulations that said, hey, this needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| done at one time so all the factors can be considered? Because, you know, here we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5751)|
| 1:36:00| have something where we've approved one track at six units an acre, and the next track comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5760)|
| 1:36:06| at two units an acre, and then in this case, the developer comes and says, well, wait a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5766)|
| 1:36:11| I need five dwelling units an acre to balance everything out when they're identical side by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5771)|
| 1:36:18| side, not identical, but side by side tracks. That's a good question, Commissioner. In this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5778)|
| 1:36:22| instance, I believe the previous applicant was under the name Jerry Price. This is Homestead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5782)|
| 1:36:28| Landholding, so we wouldn't have known when they were submitting. Like, if we don't know that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5788)|
| 1:36:33| going to end up being one development, then no. I mean, we, and even if it, yeah, there's nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5793)|
| 1:36:38| that we have in sort of administrative rules or regulations associated with that, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5798)|
| 1:36:43| we might not know that that's the plan, or maybe the property owners at the time don't know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| that's the ultimate plan. Because, you know, face value, it kind of looks like there's this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5808)|
| 1:36:54| perception of, hey, I got my one deal now, so I'm going to now, next month, do my next deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5814)|
| 1:37:02| I'm sorry. So I've got one deal now at the, what is it, what did we approve last month, 4.7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5822)|
| 1:37:08| 4.5? And then now you guys say three based on a staff recommendation, and the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5828)|
| 1:37:16| votes for three, and now they say they can't live with that, because they own the other track of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5836)|
| 1:37:22| land. It just doesn't, it doesn't, I hate to say it doesn't pass the smell test, but there's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5842)|
| 1:37:29| something's not right there. May I address the Commission on that subject? Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5849)|
| 1:37:34| So this scenario, we're, it's not an ideal scenario for us either. We really would prefer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5854)|
| 1:37:41| to go through all of the property at once. In this case, as Mrs. Brooks mentioned, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5861)|
| 1:37:48| landowner applied for rezoning prior to us being the option holder on the property. So he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5868)|
| 1:37:54| applied for the rezoning at PR5, and we shortly thereafter were able to negotiate a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5874)|
| 1:38:02| with him. And so his process was in motion, and we had a contract that reflected his efforts on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5882)|
| 1:38:08| the front end. And then the second property became available shortly thereafter, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5888)|
| 1:38:15| missed the application deadline for them to be on the same schedule. And so we then, as the option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5895)|
| 1:38:22| holder, were the applicant for the second property to take it through. And ideally, we would want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5902)|
| 1:38:28| take them through at the same time, because until we know zoning, it's hard to really design a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| property. And so we would prefer to know where we stand on a project as a whole. But in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5912)|
| 1:38:38| case, because the applicant, or excuse me, the first landowner applied for rezoning himself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5918)|
| 1:38:45| it just, it was a really unique circumstance. Did you make this, just a minute, did you make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5925)|
| 1:38:54| this comment to the Planning Commission on this track of land? What comment is that, sir? Meaning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5934)|
| 1:38:59| that you already own the other property, now you needed more than three to make everything balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5939)|
| 1:39:04| out based on your engineering studies? Or did you guys just let it roll through and let the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5944)|
| 1:39:12| recommend the three? Well, the first landowner applied for PR5 zoning. Correct. And so then when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5952)|
| 1:39:19| we took the second property through, we requested the same to match it. And then as we got further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5959)|
| 1:39:26| into the process, our engineer pointed out that there were some differences between the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5966)|
| 1:39:34| And so that's where we were able to lower the zoning on the first property, but why we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5974)|
| 1:39:39| requesting an increase in this one. Thank you. I need to call on...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5979)|
| 1:39:45| I'm sorry, you just had a follow-up. The follow-up to the same topic as him. Okay, if you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5985)|
| 1:39:52| ask the applicant. Thank you for the consideration. He made this comment to us last month when he was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5992)|
| 1:39:57| here. What he just explained, from what my recollection is, he explained the exact same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=5997)|
| 1:40:02| thing last month. He even said, this is coming next month. So I'm not trying to defend him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6002)|
| 1:40:08| but at the same time, he has been forthcoming and honest with us from the beginning before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6008)|
| 1:40:12| we even passed the last zoning last month, that this is the whole package deal they're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6012)|
| 1:40:18| execute on. Thank you, Commissioner Ward. Commissioner Bussler. Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6018)|
| 1:40:24| Let me ask you this. If they have two pieces of property which are titled differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6024)|
| 1:40:33| which is what they're going to have, it's about one property under this title and another property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6033)|
| 1:40:39| under this title. How's that going to affect when they start building on that if they have a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6039)|
| 1:40:45| kind of over the line of the other property line to sell it? What legal thing will that occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6045)|
| 1:40:56| Commissioner, my understanding would be that they would subdivide the property. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| they would combine the whole property, but I will defer to the applicant of what they intend to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6059)|
| 1:41:03| So that's what they're going to do, is they're going to combine both of them after you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6063)|
| 1:41:08| both of them bought. Is that another process, or does that just go through yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| Yes, that would be another process. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6072)|
| 1:41:17| Commissioner Daly. Yeah, that will be a combined lot, but that imaginary line is still going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6077)|
| 1:41:22| be there. So that's why they're going to be two different zonings. I will say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6082)|
| 1:41:29| Tom has been up front. Both property owners have been up front. This has been going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6089)|
| 1:41:34| with me for four months, five months, something like that. So believe me, if there was any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6094)|
| 1:41:40| hanky-panky going on, Carson wouldn't be happy right now. I can promise you that. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6100)|
| 1:41:45| no, everything's been above board. I really appreciate developers that come to a sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6105)|
| 1:41:53| commissioner, all of us, and say, hey, I want to do this project here. What do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6113)|
| 1:41:58| And this process started, I want to say, five months, six months ago. And if this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6118)|
| 1:42:05| owner would have made the decision, it would all have been at one time. But this property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6125)|
| 1:42:11| delayed his decision. That's why it's two separate ones. So I'm still sticking behind the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6131)|
| 1:42:18| Thank you, Commissioner Daly. We have a proper motion and a second before us. The motion is by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6138)|
| 1:42:24| Commissioner Daly, seconded by Commissioner Durrett to approve this rezoning with a density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6144)|
| 1:42:28| of up to 3.9 dwelling units per acre. Is there any further discussion? All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6148)|
| 1:42:36| No. Any no's? Okay, I'm a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6156)|

| 1:54:43| neighborhoods with a mix of housing types, parks, schools, et cetera. And so tonight, you've got two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6883)|
| 1:54:47| choices. You can make a legislative decision that you want to change the sector plan for this 108| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6887)|
| 1:54:52| acres from agricultural to rural residential, and then, you know, that sector plan will actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6892)|
| 1:54:59| Northeast Sector Plan says rural residential is PR up to one unit per acre, so you're going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6899)|
| 1:55:05| this is going to be like a very, very, very low-density sprawl out over 108 acres there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6905)|
| 1:55:11| You know, and if you did a fiscal analysis of what this would be at one, two, maybe even three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6911)|
| 1:55:15| units an acre, I'm going to guess that fiscal analysis doesn't pencil out, but this actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6915)|
| 1:55:20| loses money for the counties, my guess. Or your other option tonight is you can hold off, and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6920)|
| 1:55:26| is a tough decision, but Advanced Knox is going to take, I think, in the Gibbs area, a big look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6926)|
| 1:55:32| and try and help define that and define what transportation projects need to be put into place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6932)|
| 1:55:36| and what kind of infrastructure is, you know, needs to be there. And this, you know, 108 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6936)|
| 1:55:43| if it's not, you know, if they wait about a year on it and sit on it, once you have the Advanced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6943)|
| 1:55:48| Knox, you know, once that is done, I think it will give you a lot of context to make a much more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6948)|
| 1:55:52| interesting and potentially higher use land decision there, or to know that this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6952)|
| 1:55:58| that's really valuable and that needs to be preserved. So we don't know what that's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6958)|
| 1:56:02| look like, but hopefully within about a year from now we will. So this is a tough one, but this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6962)|
| 1:56:08| one that is so critical. It's a big piece, and right now a precedent is being set to do in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6968)|
| 1:56:16| Gibbs area this very low density rural sprawl out there. And you have an opportunity tonight to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6976)|
| 1:56:23| we're going to wait and, you know, not try and do that to the Gibbs area. We know we look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6983)|
| 1:56:28| Hardin Valley and that's kind of like a poster child for it's not good. So I think you have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6988)|
| 1:56:33| interesting choice in front of you, but a real opportunity to say, no, we want to support the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6993)|
| 1:56:37| Advanced Knox process and to get that vision for this area. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=6997)|
| 1:56:43| Mr. Foerster, did you want to respond? I believe there's more opposition. I'll wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7003)|
| 1:56:49| for the opposition. Mr. Murphy's the only one signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7009)|
| 1:56:56| Yeah, he's good if you're ready to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7016)|
| 1:57:09| If you have any questions, feel free to turn your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7029)|
| 1:57:11| Certainly. I have a question for Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7031)|
| 1:57:27| Can you pull up this file, the electronic file for tonight's meeting, go to page 7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7047)|
| 1:57:35| I wish I had it memorized off the top of my head. Well, no, you're going to have to look at the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7055)|
| 1:57:40| Okay, yes. I'll need just a second to pull that up. Sure, sure. They're still in discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7060)|
| 1:57:47| Commissioner Schoonmaker, can I jump in with a quick question for Mr. Snowden while he's doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7067)|
| 1:57:51| that? Sure. Mr. Snowden, with Thompson School Road, have you done sort of a look at the roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7071)|
| 1:58:01| and will this, obviously the traffic study seems to be something of this scope would absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7081)|
| 1:58:07| have to have one, but help me better understand the condition of Thompson School Road. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7087)|
| 1:58:12| not a major, it's not a minor, it's a little bit in between. Yeah, Thompson School Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7092)|
| 1:58:18| we've kind of measured in, it's probably 18-20 foot wide, center and edge lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7098)|
| 1:58:22| but it's what we would consider in the county, you know, a pretty good road as far as capacity-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7102)|
| 1:58:29| The report of the traffic letter that they did, there will be another traffic, more in-depth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7109)|
| 1:58:37| traffic analysis that's completed. They did this traffic analysis due to the rule requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7117)|
| 1:58:43| above two dwelling units NACA proposed. One of the concerns we had, and we've kind of been talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7123)|
| 1:58:50| to some community members about it, is actually Carnes Drive, which is another nearby road that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7130)|
| 1:58:55| would potentially see some cut-through traffic. So it is narrow in some areas, so there is some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7135)|
| 1:59:03| concern there that we would need to work with the applicant on a little bit further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7143)|
| 1:59:07| as the process moved forward and they did that more robust traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7147)|
| 1:59:11| Thank you, Mr. Stone. Thank you, Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Schoonmaker. You have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7154)|
| 1:59:17| Thank you. Mr. Murphy, were you able to pull up page seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7157)|
| 1:59:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7161)|
| 1:59:24| You see the developments in white to the south of the property on the first part of the zoning map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7164)|
| 1:59:31| where it says four DUs an acre? Yes, yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7171)|
| 1:59:34| And then you look at your presentation that you gave us and those developments are in the planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7174)|
| 1:59:40| growth and yet this 108 acres is in the rule. That's correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7180)|
| 1:59:48| So how do you, you know, how does somebody sitting in this seat, when you look at two adjoining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7188)|
| 1:59:55| properties and because of a line that was made in, what was this made back in, you said 2015?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7195)|
| 2:00:06| The rural growth boundary was set by the growth plan in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7206)|
| 2:00:10| Okay. How do you say that this property owner that owns 108 doesn't get to do four dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7210)|
| 2:00:17| units an acre because the adjoining property to the south and the southeast, those are all four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7217)|
| 2:00:24| dwelling units per acre and he's only asking for, what is it, 2.9. So how does someone in our position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7224)|
| 2:00:32| not say he's got a valid point to increase the number of dwelling units on the 108 acre track?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7232)|
| 2:00:44| It is a, I think it is actually, it's a tough decision to make. The pattern that has led us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7244)|
| 2:00:52| that we've been operating under for a number of years has been we rezone something at a particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7252)|
| 2:00:59| density and then we sprawl out to the next parcel at maybe a slightly lower density or equivalent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7259)|
| 2:01:05| you know, lower and we continue to justify that sprawl, you know, that continued sprawl pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7265)|
| 2:01:10| out this way. If we applied that same line of thinking to this parcel, sure, you could say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7270)|
| 2:01:17| well, that makes sense, it's next to something that's planned residential, this is only three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7277)|
| 2:01:22| there's a road going out to it, we think we can rejigger some things. But if we take a bigger view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7282)|
| 2:01:27| of, you know, we're actually, I think the Gibbs area is going to see more interest in the, through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7287)|
| 2:01:33| advanced NOx process than a lot of other areas because this is the one that is primed to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7293)|
| 2:01:39| but there's a lot of desire to, you know, figure out how to preserve that area out there. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7299)|
| 2:01:45| this is where there is a real opportunity to apply a little bit of discretion, say, maybe, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7305)|
| 2:01:52| it's okay to wait a year. We are so close to having an updated vision and land use and guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7312)|
| 2:01:58| and everything that will actually, you know, work for that community. Because right now we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7318)|
| 2:02:03| have great choices, you're right. But we do have a line that was set and it was set very deliberately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7323)|
| 2:02:09| by the community. Also, Ms. Harrell reminded me that she had submitted a petition from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7329)|
| 2:02:15| and that was in your inbox. I think Commissioner Buehler has the original copy of that, so there are a number of signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7335)|
| 2:02:19| We have. Thank you. Mr. Biggs. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman. So, Mr. Murphy, if I'm hearing you correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7339)|
| 2:02:26| what you're implying is, is the growth plan area that was set 20 years ago that you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7346)|
| 2:02:34| not going to the outlying parcels like Commissioner Schoonmaker was saying for the specific amount that they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7354)|
| 2:02:42| you suggest those parcels actually go at a higher density so we don't have to build up because of the housing shortage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7362)|
| 2:02:48| Or is that kind of what you're saying? Well, inside the plan growth area, it's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7368)|
| 2:02:53| Inside the plan growth area, we've got opportunity for more density. And there's actually on East Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7373)|
| 2:02:59| about three, four months ago, we had a rezoning request. Originally, it came in at 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7379)|
| 2:03:04| It was right at Emory Road and Tazeville Pike. The applicant later lowered it to about four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7384)|
| 2:03:09| But it's actually on the sector plan, it's allowed for 12 units an acre. And that's right where we want to do dense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7389)|
| 2:03:14| because there's potential for sidewalk access to shopping, to park, to schools and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7394)|
| 2:03:20| That was there. And that's actually an interesting one because the applicant had the opportunity to do higher density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7400)|
| 2:03:26| and they reverted back to their standard single family residential three, four units an acre model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7406)|
| 2:03:31| And I was kind of disappointed personally. If I remember correctly, they wanted apartments and we got houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7411)|
| 2:03:36| Correct. Yeah, they were thinking like an apartment, you know, multifamily type unit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7416)|
| 2:03:40| So where I'm going with that is if we went by your strategy, the parcels, because we heard tonight somebody said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7420)|
| 2:03:48| which a statement that I actually don't agree with, they said once it's zoned a certain way, you can't rebuild.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7428)|
| 2:03:54| I don't agree. I believe once you build, you can always come back and you can increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7434)|
| 2:03:59| But what about the people that desire Gibbs and they do want the schools and they do want to raise their children in those specific areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7439)|
| 2:04:09| There's not a huge housing opportunity out there. I've looked on housing websites myself to see what's out in that specific area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7449)|
| 2:04:16| So that's my question to you. Inside those areas, do you think we should go back and increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7456)|
| 2:04:22| And in those areas outside of that, what do you suggest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7462)|
| 2:04:26| So I really actually want the advanced NOx process to be done two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7466)|
| 2:04:33| And I really want that updated because I think we're actually in plain growth, probably we're developing not dense enough inside the plain growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7473)|
| 2:04:46| Our challenge has always been in the plain growth area has a map, but we haven't had the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7486)|
| 2:04:52| It's on the map, but we haven't piped up the infrastructure to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7492)|
| 2:04:56| So in my opinion, what if the plain growth area that we're talking about now, since we haven't touched it in 20 years, is actually the area that we're talking about tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7496)|
| 2:05:02| It could be. And my point there is it would really, I think, respect the community and the planners and transportation and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7502)|
| 2:05:12| if we said let's get that one year down the road from now. We'll know a lot more in 12 months when advanced NOx wraps up than we will tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7512)|
| 2:05:21| And I think that's so important because there are a lot of other large parcels that are right out there that could just go like that over the next 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7521)|
| 2:05:31| And we could just low density sprawl. Or we could call a pause and we could say this is so close to having advanced NOx done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7531)|
| 2:05:39| We really want that vision out there and we want to see where should that line be and what infrastructure and how can we build this community to be better out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7539)|
| 2:05:46| How can we do a really good job and not harden valley what we have out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7546)|
| 2:05:52| I wouldn't want you to postpone that for years and years, but we have something very much in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7552)|
| 2:06:01| It was well attended, the session out there, and you've got a lot of feedback already from round one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7561)|
| 2:06:06| Thank you, Mr. Murphy. Commissioners, may I look at you one second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7566)|
| 2:06:10| I have one question for Mr. Brooks and I want to give Ms. Brooks, then I want to give Mr. Forster an opportunity to respond and also take questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7570)|
| 2:06:19| Ms. Brooks, I wanted to clarify, is Mr. Murphy's assertion correct that a rural residential in a rural area is recommended at one unit per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7579)|
| 2:06:31| The recommendation in this sector plan does speak to that for the northeast county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7591)|
| 2:06:38| But I would bring to your attention the growth policy plan, which I think is the controlling plan in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7598)|
| 2:06:46| And if you look at section 3.5, extensions of low density residential development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7606)|
| 2:06:53| densities of one to three dwelling units per acre into the rural area shall be limited to certain conditions, which is zoned planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7613)|
| 2:07:00| have sewer and public water services and connecting via collector arterial rolls to the urban growth boundary or planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7620)|
| 2:07:08| Okay, thank you, Ms. Brooks. Commissioner Smith, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7628)|
| 2:07:14| Mr. Forster, did you want to respond to any of Mr. Murphy's comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7634)|
| 2:07:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7638)|
| 2:07:24| First, I'm amazed that Mr. Murphy's here talking about higher density, which is great because I think everybody's starting to get on the same page with what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7644)|
| 2:07:36| I think the problem with the strategy of let's pause a year is we don't know what this landowner's circumstances are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7656)|
| 2:07:46| They may need this money. Are we going to guarantee them if we make them wait a year they're going to get the same money they can get next year they got this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7666)|
| 2:07:54| That's all I really wanted to say. We need to also bear in mind the owner's property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7674)|
| 2:08:04| Thank you, Commissioner Smith. Mr. Forster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7684)|
| 2:08:08| My comments are going to echo exactly what Commissioner Smith said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7688)|
| 2:08:13| You're tying up a lady's property. We say a year, but that's the best case scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7693)|
| 2:08:19| As for the sector plan and the up to one units per density, I completely agree with Executive Director Brooks that the growth policy plan does control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7699)|
| 2:08:31| and that based on the language of the growth policy plan that up to three is in fact permissible here. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7711)|
| 2:08:37| Thank you, Mr. Forster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7717)|
| 2:08:40| Yeah, I have a few comments. This has been on my radar for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7720)|
| 2:08:45| I knew this farm on Thompson School Road was coming up for contract and it was going to be before us at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7725)|
| 2:08:54| I appreciate the compassionate look at the property owner's situation financially, just like we sometimes are willing to look at a developer's bottom line financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7734)|
| 2:09:08| To me, that's similar to the emotional argument that we've heard from folks like Ms. Harrell that say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7748)|
| 2:09:15| I loved the horses that were on that farm and I've worked on that farm as a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7755)|
| 2:09:20| There are tons of emotional arguments on both sides, is my point, that may or may not have anything to do with this body following the letter of the law and how the plans work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7760)|
| 2:09:32| In my view, we are being asked to make an exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7772)|
| 2:09:36| It's been there a while, yes, but it is the line that we've tried to go by for as long as I've been on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7776)|
| 2:09:41| and that is the line that demarcates between the planned growth area and the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7781)|
| 2:09:48| We have a process in process right now to potentially redraw those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7788)|
| 2:09:57| In the meantime, we seem to keep moving those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7797)|
| 2:10:01| Sometimes there are reasons to move those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7801)|
| 2:10:04| There was one tonight where it just made sense to move the line a little bit to get a commercial piece of property in a commercial corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7804)|
| 2:10:14| I think there are a couple of developments that I've gotten wind of coming to the 8th District that I actually think probably check the boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7814)|
| 2:10:22| I will support moving that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7822)|
| 2:10:25| I'm not sure I do on this one, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7825)|
| 2:10:29| It's very easy to say, well, we need to move the line because we want to go one more subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7829)|
| 2:10:36| We could keep doing that all the way out on Thompson School Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7836)|
| 2:10:40| That argument would hold more water with me if we were moving to the south of these parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7840)|
| 2:10:45| If we were moving to the south of these parcels into those agricultural properties, I could see staying at 4 or 3.5 or whatever, but we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7845)|
| 2:10:53| We're actually moving away from development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7853)|
| 2:10:55| You're intimately familiar with this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| You are moving, as we would say out in Gibbs, back into the ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7857)|
| 2:11:02| That's where Thompson School Road goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7862)|
| 2:11:04| It goes back into the ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7864)|
| 2:11:06| If you've not driven it, you should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7866)|
| 2:11:09| That's the direction you're going from the parcels that are zoned at 4 and 4.25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7869)|
| 2:11:16| This is a big parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7876)|
| 2:11:18| It's a lot of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7878)|
| 2:11:20| It's going to be a lot of houses, regardless of what we zone it at, if we amend the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7880)|
| 2:11:25| I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| We need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7887)|
| 2:11:29| But I think we've got a community that's really nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7889)|
| 2:11:35| They're looking at Hardin Valley, and they're thinking, good grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7895)|
| 2:11:38| Is the same thing coming here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7898)|
| 2:11:41| Are we going to make the same decisions all over the county that we made in Hardin Valley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7901)|
| 2:11:48| I'm not saying this parcel is never going to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7908)|
| 2:11:50| We may come back from Advanced Knox and say, absolutely, yeah, this needs to be residential rather than agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7910)|
| 2:11:58| But how the Gibbs area is dealt with by Advanced Knox is going to be crucial in how we plan and develop the rest of the developable land in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7918)|
| 2:12:13| That's where growth is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7933)|
| 2:12:15| And Gibbs has a long history of being a rural community with a potential town center in Harbison's Crossroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7935)|
| 2:12:24| And I'm all for that town center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7944)|
| 2:12:26| I want to see that town center develop with some small-town type amenities and retail and several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7946)|
| 2:12:33| I don't want to see it be just a red light and four roads forever, and it's not now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7953)|
| 2:12:37| It's way different than it was when I was a kid, and I'm glad it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7957)|
| 2:12:40| It's going to need to be different 20 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7960)|
| 2:12:42| But that doesn't mean there's no stopping point as we go back into the ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7962)|
| 2:12:49| So that's my two cents, and I'm actually prepared to make a motion to deny this sector plan amendment based on the criteria I just laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7969)|
| 2:12:56| So I'll allow Commissioner Smith to speak before I do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7976)|
| 2:13:02| I may be confused, Amy. Maybe you can straighten me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7982)|
| 2:13:06| But we're talking about moving a line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7986)|
| 2:13:09| I guess this is in reference to moving the rural and the growth line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7989)|
| 2:13:16| But in rural, under our growth plan policy, two units an acre in the rural area, three of the utilities are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=7996)|
| 2:13:25| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8005)|
| 2:13:28| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8008)|
| 2:13:29| You wouldn't technically be moving that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8009)|
| 2:13:32| You would be changing the designation from rural area to planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8012)|
| 2:13:37| Well, we wouldn't be changing it from rural to planned growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8017)|
| 2:13:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8021)|
| 2:13:42| We'd just be doing what's allowed in the rural area according to the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8022)|
| 2:13:48| Can you repeat that, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8028)|
| 2:13:51| I have a question about that. Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8031)|
| 2:13:54| In the rural area, under the growth policy plan, you can develop PR at two units an acre, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8034)|
| 2:14:03| That is correct if I meet certain criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8043)|
| 2:14:06| And if there's utilities available, it can go up to three units an acre if water and sewer is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8046)|
| 2:14:11| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8051)|
| 2:14:13| If there's water and sewer available and it connects to the urban growth area or planned growth area via collector or arterial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8053)|
| 2:14:21| And that's exactly what this piece of property does, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8061)|
| 2:14:27| It does meet that criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8067)|
| 2:14:29| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8069)|
| 2:14:35| I guess my question was if we don't amend the sector plan and it remains under the agricultural designation under the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8075)|
| 2:14:42| does that still allow for up to three units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8082)|
| 2:14:45| I'm sorry, how many did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8085)|
| 2:14:47| Would that still allow up to three units per acre if it remained under the agricultural?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8087)|
| 2:14:51| If it remains agricultural, it's up to one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8091)|
| 2:14:53| Right. That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8093)|
| 2:14:55| That's the reason for the sector plan amendment that's being asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8095)|
| 2:14:57| Okay. Mr. Busley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8097)|
| 2:15:00| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8100)|
| 2:15:03| Years ago, when I first got on commission, we had a problem of getting a school to Gibbs Middle School, which was taken away out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8103)|
| 2:15:11| And I did a lot of talking with the people out there in your district, Commissioner Beeler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8111)|
| 2:15:19| and I warned them, well, once you put that school in out there, people are going to demand to be in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8119)|
| 2:15:25| They want to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8125)|
| 2:15:29| And it's a beautiful place out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8129)|
| 2:15:33| Not as good as the 7th District, but it's a beautiful place out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8133)|
| 2:15:38| And we see growth growing all over the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8138)|
| 2:15:43| And we have an opportunity here to kind of guide the growth in that area a little bit with this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8143)|
| 2:15:52| because it's going to add, it's going to have people that really want to move to that area, to build in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8152)|
| 2:15:59| and cause other things to come to that area, like the town center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8159)|
| 2:16:06| But if you don't have that out there, you're not going to get the town center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8166)|
| 2:16:10| And you're going to get the growth that only can go out there and probably make a problem in the future, a future growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8170)|
| 2:16:20| To me, we can control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8180)|
| 2:16:24| This thing about sprawl, sprawl doesn't occur until the demand is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8184)|
| 2:16:30| And the demand is getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8190)|
| 2:16:33| And Tennessee is really being pushed for demand for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8193)|
| 2:16:37| And that is such a pretty piece of property living out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8197)|
| 2:16:40| So I want to say right now, I can't go with your recommendation with what you're doing out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8200)|
| 2:16:48| And I think what you need to do is have the 2.9, which is a lot less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8208)|
| 2:16:54| and the planned residential makes it to where it has to be done at a certain level instead of leaving it agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8214)|
| 2:17:02| And that will also protect the other property values out in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8222)|
| 2:17:06| So I'd like to make a substitute motion to do the second plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8226)|
| 2:17:11| We don't have a motion yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8231)|
| 2:17:13| You don't have a motion yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8233)|
| 2:17:15| No second yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| Well, I didn't really offer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8237)|
| 2:17:18| I yielded to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8238)|
| 2:17:20| Would you like me to offer my motion first so you can make a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8240)|
| 2:17:25| You can make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8245)|
| 2:17:26| Whatever you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8246)|
| 2:17:29| Well, I want to make a motion that we do the sector plan, the 2.9, and change it from agricultural to planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8249)|
| 2:17:38| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8258)|
| 2:17:40| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8260)|
| 2:17:41| We're not on zoning yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8261)|
| 2:17:42| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8262)|
| 2:17:43| Never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8263)|
| 2:17:44| Make the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8264)|
| 2:17:45| Yeah, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8265)|
| 2:17:46| You approve the sector plan first, then we can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8266)|
| 2:17:48| So you're making a motion to do the sector plan amendment as recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8268)|
| 2:17:51| And again, I hate to step across the boundaries, but we need to look for that growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8271)|
| 2:17:57| and this is not going way beyond what would normally be out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8277)|
| 2:18:01| That's our job, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8281)|
| 2:18:04| No offense taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8284)|
| 2:18:06| Is there a second to Commissioner Busser's motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8286)|
| 2:18:08| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8288)|
| 2:18:09| Seconded by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8289)|
| 2:18:10| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8290)|
| 2:18:13| Commissioner Daly, you don't want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8293)|
| 2:18:16| I was going to make sure that the motions as approved sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8296)|
| 2:18:21| are our rural residential hillside protection and stream protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8301)|
| 2:18:25| Is that correct, Commissioner Busser?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8305)|
| 2:18:28| Second go with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8308)|
| 2:18:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8309)|
| 2:18:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8310)|
| 2:18:31| Well, I'll offer a substitute motion that we deny the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8311)|
| 2:18:35| and keep it agricultural hillside protection and stream protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8315)|
| 2:18:39| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8319)|
| 2:18:44| Hearing none, that motion fails for lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| We're back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8326)|
| 2:18:49| That motion is to approve per the Planning Commission recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8329)|
| 2:18:54| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8334)|
| 2:18:56| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8336)|
| 2:18:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8338)|
| 2:18:59| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8339)|

| 2:19:17| It's a request of I-75 Land Partners, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8357)|
| 2:19:20| for rezoning from A, agricultural, to PR plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8360)|
| 2:19:24| up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8364)|

| 2:19:41| Again, just to reiterate, we'd ask that this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8381)|
| 2:19:45| rezone the property to plan residential up to 2.9 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8385)|

| 2:20:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8403)|

| 2:20:13| Thank you, Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8413)|
| 2:20:14| Mr. Forrester, did you need any further comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8414)|
| 2:20:17| I'll submit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8417)|
| 2:20:18| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8418)|
| 2:20:19| Mr. Murphy, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8419)|
| 2:20:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8420)|
| 2:20:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8421)|
| 2:20:22| First, I want to address, there was a point that was just brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8422)|
| 2:20:25| in the sector plan discussion, and it's relevant to zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8425)|
| 2:20:28| When you're looking at plan amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8428)|
| 2:20:30| and you're looking at rezoning requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8430)|
| 2:20:32| those are legislative actions that don't represent property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8432)|
| 2:20:38| A sector plan amendment is a property owner requesting a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8438)|
| 2:20:42| in the land use designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8442)|
| 2:20:44| and the rezoning request is a property owner requesting a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8444)|
| 2:20:49| It is up to this body to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8449)|
| 2:20:51| if you think those are appropriate or not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8451)|
| 2:20:54| The rights that they have are vested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8454)|
| 2:20:56| in whatever their current existing zoning is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8456)|
| 2:21:00| This is something I hear from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8460)|
| 2:21:02| and I want to get that one off my chest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8462)|
| 2:21:05| Related to the rezoning, I did give in your handout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8465)|
| 2:21:10| there's three pages past that map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8470)|
| 2:21:12| The first one is the text of Zoning Ordinance 6.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8472)|
| 2:21:16| which deals with amendments to the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8476)|
| 2:21:19| 6.301 gives standards for all text and map amendments that have to be met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8479)|
| 2:21:24| and item D, which is in bold, says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8484)|
| 2:21:26| The proposed amendment shall be consistent with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8486)|
| 2:21:28| and not in conflict with, the general plan of Knoxville and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8488)|
| 2:21:31| including any of its elements, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8491)|
| 2:21:35| The Northeast County Sector Plan is an element of the County General Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8495)|
| 2:21:40| and therefore zoning and text map amendments for the Northeast sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8500)|
| 2:21:44| must be consistent with the Northeast County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8504)|
| 2:21:48| And then in the next two pages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8508)|
| 2:21:50| you have the 2015 Sector Plan title page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8510)|
| 2:21:53| showing it was adopted in January 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8513)|
| 2:21:56| and then Table 55, which deals with the Land Use Classification Table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8516)|
| 2:22:01| In that, there's a section for the Rural Residential Land Use Pattern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8521)|
| 2:22:05| or Sector Plan, which is what you just adopted for this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8525)|
| 2:22:12| And there's a table of recommended zoning programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8532)|
| 2:22:15| which say for the county's rural area, open space, estate, rural residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8535)|
| 2:22:21| which I don't think actually exists as a zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8541)|
| 2:22:23| I couldn't find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8543)|
| 2:22:24| And then it says planned residential at densities of one dwelling unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8544)|
| 2:22:28| where dwellings may be clustered in a portion of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8548)|
| 2:22:31| It says you may also, other zonings to consider are A in the growth plans area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8551)|
| 2:22:35| So rezoning does need to comply with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8555)|
| 2:22:39| Now, I just heard the argument brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8559)|
| 2:22:41| well, the growth plan says you can, if you meet certain criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8561)|
| 2:22:44| which this parcel does, allow up to three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8564)|
| 2:22:49| And it does say, yes, extensions of low-density residential development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8569)|
| 2:22:53| densities of one to three dwelling units per acre can be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8573)|
| 2:22:56| So the growth plan, which is your high, overarching one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8576)|
| 2:22:59| and gives out your general things, that says it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8579)|
| 2:23:02| And that same type of language is also, in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8582)|
| 2:23:05| followed over into the general plan development policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8585)|
| 2:23:08| I think that's 6.10 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8588)|
| 2:23:11| But then we get, you know, so the plans, you know, they're a funnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8591)|
| 2:23:14| You start with the growth plan at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8594)|
| 2:23:16| That's your most general policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8596)|
| 2:23:18| Your next level is the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8598)|
| 2:23:20| Finally, you get to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8600)|
| 2:23:21| And that's where, in the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8601)|
| 2:23:23| it says that there's a conscious choice here to actually limit to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8603)|
| 2:23:26| You could, the sector plan could allow up to three, you know, for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8606)|
| 2:23:30| But here there's a choice that said we actually want to go on the low end of the scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8610)|
| 2:23:34| that's allowed for low-density of one to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8614)|
| 2:23:36| So you can read it in, you know, there's, I guess this is how you interpret it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8616)|
| 2:23:41| But I always go from most general down to most specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8621)|
| 2:23:46| And the sector plan doesn't conflict with what the general plan and the growth plan say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8626)|
| 2:23:51| The sector plan says up to one is what we allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8631)|
| 2:23:55| The general plan and growth plan allow up to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8635)|
| 2:23:58| But this sector plan, which is the most specific that applies here, says up to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8638)|
| 2:24:02| So I think for your rezoning, you actually have a requirement in the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8642)|
| 2:24:08| that to be consistent, it needs to follow that land use classification table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8648)|
| 2:24:15| And so I would, you know, argue that anything that's not open space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8655)|
| 2:24:21| estate or PR at one dwelling unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8661)|
| 2:24:23| your rezoning won't be consistent with the northeast county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8663)|
| 2:24:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8667)|
| 2:24:28| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8668)|
| 2:24:30| Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8670)|
| 2:24:32| Yeah, my response would be that this isn't inconsistent what we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8672)|
| 2:24:37| What he cited to are general recommendations in a sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8677)|
| 2:24:42| not attributed to one specific piece of property or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8682)|
| 2:24:46| It is general in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8686)|
| 2:24:49| And, again, the growth policy plan is the overarching document that controls here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8689)|
| 2:24:55| and that's one that tells us that we can go up to three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8695)|
| 2:24:59| Again, rezoning, sector plan amendments, each property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8699)|
| 2:25:03| and this comes up all the time, is considered on an individual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8703)|
| 2:25:07| No two properties are the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8707)|
| 2:25:08| And that's why you have the flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8708)|
| 2:25:10| That's why we have recommendations and not requirements that blanket this entire area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8710)|
| 2:25:15| because this body, here's from the applicant, here's from the opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8715)|
| 2:25:21| considers the needs of the community and uses their discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8721)|
| 2:25:27| and their wisdom in making proper rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8727)|
| 2:25:32| And we think that 2.9 is appropriate and proper and is needed for housing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8732)|
| 2:25:38| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8738)|
| 2:25:39| Thank you, Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8739)|
| 2:25:40| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8740)|
| 2:25:41| Mr. Forrester, I've got a quick question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8741)|
| 2:25:43| You just, what you basically just spoke of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8743)|
| 2:25:47| if this property was five units per acre, you would still be requesting 2.9 units per acre, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8747)|
| 2:25:52| I'm sorry, say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8752)|
| 2:25:53| If this property was just five acres, you would still be requesting the 2.9 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8753)|
| 2:25:56| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8756)|
| 2:25:57| So my question to you is, is if we do wait a year and it does come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8757)|
| 2:26:01| and this is part of the growth plan and you could request the 4.25 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8761)|
| 2:26:06| would you feel comfortable that your client would do so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8766)|
| 2:26:11| You know, I guess if the advanced NOCs came back and said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8771)|
| 2:26:15| we haven't looked at this in over 20 years, we need housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8775)|
| 2:26:20| this is a good piece of property in this area, let's plan growth up to five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8780)|
| 2:26:24| then, you know, I think if my client had the property under contract or owned it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8784)|
| 2:26:29| then it would get a different look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8789)|
| 2:26:31| It may be a higher density then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8791)|
| 2:26:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8793)|
| 2:26:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8794)|
| 2:26:36| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8796)|
| 2:26:38| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8798)|
| 2:26:40| Director Brooks, what was the staff recommendation on density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8800)|
| 2:26:48| Staff recommendation was, one moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8808)|
| 2:26:55| 2.9 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8815)|
| 2:26:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8817)|
| 2:26:58| That's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8818)|
| 2:26:59| I move we approve this as a density of two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8819)|
| 2:27:03| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8823)|
| 2:27:08| Can you repeat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8828)|
| 2:27:10| I said I move that we approve this rezoning as stated at a density of two units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8830)|
| 2:27:16| per acre, which was the recommendation of the planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8836)|
| 2:27:20| Planning staff, not commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8840)|
| 2:27:22| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8842)|
| 2:27:23| Planning commission, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8843)|
| 2:27:25| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8845)|
| 2:27:27| Hearing none, that motion fails for lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8847)|
| 2:27:30| We're back to the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8850)|
| 2:27:32| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8852)|
| 2:27:33| I make a motion that we approve planned residential zoning up to 2.9 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8853)|
| 2:27:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8860)|
| 2:27:41| I have a motion by Commissioner Daly with a second by Commissioner Bussler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8861)|
| 2:27:44| to approve this rezoning at a density of up to 2.9 dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8864)|
| 2:27:49| as recommended by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8869)|
| 2:27:51| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8871)|
| 2:27:53| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8873)|

| 2:27:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8876)|
| 2:28:00| Motion of the vote is 9-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8880)|
| 2:28:02| That item passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-zoning?start=8882)|
