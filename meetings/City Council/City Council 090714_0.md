| 0:11:05| Councilman Huckleston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| I think some council members are probably everybody is aware that the joint task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=667)|
| 0:11:13| city county task force on ridgetop and hillside protection, that's abbreviated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| The name is abbreviated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| I can't remember it all the time, the entire description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| But that task force has done a lot of work over more than a year, estimated more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=682)|
| 0:11:28| 5,000 volunteer and staff hours have gone into that effort so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=688)|
| 0:11:34| And there are a series of public meetings going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| There's one going on even as we speak in halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| There was one last night in South Dole Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| There are eight total so that after tonight there will be six obviously if you do the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| And I'm not going to go through all the locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| There's one tomorrow night and there's one on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| If people want more information, they can go to the MPC, the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=714)|
| 0:12:00| website and look at it there and get the schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| The one tomorrow night is, I will just say, is at the L.T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| Ross building here in the heart of the city on Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| So that I think is an effort that's noteworthy and I would encourage people to go and attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| those meetings if at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| Also a reminder to council and anyone else that's interested, the Transportation Mobility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| will be meeting on Thursday at three at the chamber to talk about the Charlotte trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| And I believe, oh yes, on Monday the 20th, there's a briefing next door at 530 in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=754)|
| 0:12:44| small assembly room on the sustainable development program that Trey Benefeld at MPC headed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=764)|
| 0:12:53| that task force or committee or whatever it's called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| So there's some interesting ideas there in terms of how to pursue sustainable development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| And I believe that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| Any other reports of council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| 8A is a resolution confirming the reappointments of David Dewhurst and John Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| and the appointment of Carol Montgomery to the Downtown Design Review Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=792)|
| 0:13:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| Item 9A is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Section 19-63 to prohibit impeding sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=803)|
| 0:13:29| access in the Downtown North redevelopment zone and the Central Business Improvement District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=809)|
| 0:13:38| There are several folks signed up to speak, and we can proceed to that if that would be council's desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=818)|
| 0:13:48| Dr. Lyons, do you want to talk about, or I guess Bob Wetzel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| do you want to talk about kind of how we got to this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| I'd be happy to, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| There's several things on how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| We started back last fall having a discussion of internal meetings with the Department of Policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=844)|
| 0:14:10| the Law Department, Police Department, Economic Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| on how we could enhance economic development in both the Downtown area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| and the Central Business Improvement District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| In doing that, in light of the fact that we have a number of shelters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| and support agencies that also need to serve the people out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=866)|
| 0:14:32| That also started back in the Fifth and Broadway Task Force three years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| when deciding the Med Bella first began,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| starting to discuss what are some of the ways we can do to help folks coexist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| in the Central Business District and the Downtown North area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| So those discussions have moved forward to the ordinance that you have in front of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| or in front of you, which basically would add, and one other thing I should add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=890)|
| 0:14:56| the current ordinance we have for sidewalk loitering is not enforceable in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| It has a few flaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| So we're trying to amend that to give it some teeth, make it more enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| And the teeth it's given is to prohibit the sitting in the line on city sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| in the Central Business District or the Downtown North Improvement Area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| And that's all it prohibits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| It doesn't prohibit standing, walking, running, protesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| All those things are still available to be done on city sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| but it does prohibit sitting in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| And if that happens, it does give our police officers an opportunity to talk to folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| and get them to move along to certain places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| The question I've heard come up so much over the last two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| since this has had some discussion, is where are the folks going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| Where are people going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| And I think the answer to that is two- or three-fold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| One is we have a great array of support services in this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| We have the CARM, Crossroads Day Care, Crossroads Welcome Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| which if somebody seriously wants to get their life in the right direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| and get off the street, they can get them in touch with the services that they need to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| and give them a place to stay during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| We have been working with TDOT and CARM over the last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| to make sure that we could expand the outdoor space that these folks could stay during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| Obviously, everybody would like to have a place to sit in the sunshine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| and not have to sit inside all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| And we've been working so CARM will be able to move their staff parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| and visitor parking up underneath the new freeway project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| and there will be more space outside for folks to sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| I've noticed Bart Rosen is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| You might want to ask him some questions on that in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| So we've worked with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| So they have a place where folks can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| You know, VMC has got their new facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| They have a place for folks to go during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| But you have to be committed to finding housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| You know, you can't just come there because you want to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| You have to be committed to taking the right steps to get in the right direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| and go towards finding solutions to your problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| So with all that, and then with the housing going on at Menvella,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| the housing at the Salvation Army, the Salvation Army Thrift Store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| the Granning Paint Store, Harb's Carpet, a number of other places there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| these folks have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| could you give us some help on clearing the sidewalks in front of our businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| so that we can do a normal type business in this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| It's been kind of frustrating for those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| So when I first started this job a year and a half ago downtown north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| the first thing was, what can we do about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| What can we do about some of these issues here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| No matter how many facades you do, how many road diets you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| we've got to deal with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| So this is a small step in starting to deal with this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| to try to keep things moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| What's going on there is not good for anybody at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| There are places for folks to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| and we think this is a small step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| So with that said, I'll answer some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| Yeah, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| So the way people are sitting on the sidewalks now is not against the law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1067)|
| 0:17:56| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| That is my understanding of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| Right now the sidewalk has to be blocked before our officers can take any action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| The sidewalk would have to be physically blocked before they could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| So we don't have an element to deal with people that are sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| or laying there all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| And at times we have folks that lay there all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| And those folks need help, and there's places close by for those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| So from their point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| what they're doing is what they've been allowed to do for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| And so has there been any conversation with the people on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1104)|
| 0:18:29| as to what this culture change might mean to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| No direct conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| That's why there is a 90-day kind of warning period written into this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| where there will be a 90-day education and training period with the KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| to try to bring this into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| What will that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| Try to change that culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| What will that education period look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| Well, it will look like, I would assume, we don't have all the details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| and the Chief might speak to this just a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| but his officers will be trained to go up and talk to people about the new ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| tell them what it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| and tell them what their options are to where they might go during the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| if they're sitting or lying on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| So they will offer clear options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| That will be part of it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| Who will take those options and who won't will be individual choices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| but there will be options given as to what you can do with yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| It's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| I think our ordinance has created some unintentional consequences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1162)|
| 0:19:28| as you've alluded to, with people needing a place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| The people at Old Gray Cemetery, for example, are very upset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| because they've had problems all along with people who come into the cemetery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| and drink and do drugs and litter and turn over tombstones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| and do other destructive things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| So they're concerned that this ordinance will lead to more of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| And I guess my concern is just how committed is CARM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| and other agencies to making a facility outside available to these people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1199)|
| 0:20:08| They can't hang around the day rooms all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| They like to be outside where they can smoke cigarettes or do whatever, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| And I just wonder how committed they are to building this park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| recreation area, or whatever you might call it, where these people might go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| It would be an outdoor sitting area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| My understanding, and Burt's right behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| I'll turn to him in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| It's my understanding that they're very committed to have an outside sitting area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| where people can stay during the day if they come onto their premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| If you come onto somebody's premises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| you have to agree to go by their rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| And that's part of the issue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| What are the rules and regulations that are coming on those premises for support and help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| Burt, would you like to say anything about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1248)|
| 0:21:00| If you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| Burt Rosen, 5308 Winding Brook Lane, Knoxville 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1262)|
| 0:21:08| And Burt's the Executive Director of Knox Area Rescue Mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| Just in response to your question, Councilman Booker, in terms of how committed CARM is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| we have been committed to this for the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| And we've been trying to accomplish a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| One, in concert with the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| when Volunteer Ministry Center pursued permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| there was a need for someone to pick up the daytime services that VMC was previously offering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| We elected to go ahead and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| And with the help of the city and the 10-year plan office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| we were to fund the first year of that operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| And what began as another version of the day room evolved into the Crossroads Welcome Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1303)|
| 0:21:49| where we now have 21 different agencies within the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| all who are utilizing space there, which allows us to immediately assess an individual's needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| get them into the HMIS system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| and move them along to the services that will best support the needs that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| Part of that plan from the outset was to convert some indoor space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| and then, as funds permitted, convert the outdoor parking lot into something that would be a nice sitting area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1330)|
| 0:22:17| trying to give KPD and law enforcement an option so that if people were being asked to move along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| at least there was a nicer place for them to be able to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| And the beauty of this is that the setback was far enough off Broadway, the way we designed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| that it would move people off of Broadway, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| And number two, if you're traveling on Gate Street, it's far enough down to where it's not visible there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| So to create a comfortable space, one that is welcoming and inviting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| would give us an opportunity to offer that alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| And we have remained committed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| I don't think when we went into this anybody expected the economy to be doing what it is it's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| And so we're still committed to doing that as the resources permit us to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| but we're laying all the groundwork and the plans to continue moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| The first piece of that was being able to access the parking underneath the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| which is very, very close to being ready for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| Now we have the ordinance that we'll be getting people off the streets soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| How soon are you talking about in getting this facility ready for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1392)|
| 0:23:20| I'm not sure that I know the exact answer to that, but what I can tell you is that the space is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1400)|
| 0:23:26| And while it may not be immediately designed as nice as we would like it to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| we already have an average of 175 people a day who are coming through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| taking advantage of those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| What we're hoping is that that space will allow us to continue to do that in a better fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| But if we had to start creating the space today, we could create makeshift space there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| Again, it may not be as aesthetically pleasing as we would like it to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| it may not be as comfortable as we would like it to be, but it would be ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| You know, when this problem first came to my attention, I went out and looked at some spots, potential spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1436)|
| 0:24:03| And, of course, there's a place on Cooper Street just next door to the Salvation Army under the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1443)|
| 0:24:11| That's out of the weather if needs be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| Maybe people might want to be in open spaces with some trees planted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| But it seems to me that there might be an alternative for some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| In the wintertime, would that be a place to be under the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| where they're away from the elements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| It's a big problem, and I think it's going to get bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| And I'm just looking for answers as to how we treat these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| Well, I'm certainly not an expert on the subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| But what I can tell you is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| When we send our staff and volunteers out into the streets to do the outreach effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| what we find is that a number of people do not want to come inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| They don't want to be confined inside a small setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| They much prefer to be outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| And so our strategy has been if we could create that welcoming outdoor space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| it might be appealing enough for people to come and sit over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| And if one looks at the research that Dr. Roger Noe has done over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| that talks about how important it is to engage someone as a first step of moving out of homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| this gives us an opportunity to engage people that otherwise we might not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| We can only give it our best shot, but I don't think there's any guarantees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| I think Councilman Booker has asked a couple of questions that concern me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| the timing, the scheduling, knowing that this was in the works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| and yet I haven't seen anything concrete in terms of just where to direct folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1544)|
| 0:25:51| who need to find another place to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| And then I've had a number of calls, as a matter of fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| and e-mails with concerns about the element situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1558)|
| 0:26:05| not being able to get away from the rain or the cold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| which will be coming upon us before we know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| So I guess I'm a little concerned about scheduling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| although you indicate that open space is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| Well, it is, Congresswoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| I'm a congressman, woman, so forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| Oh, well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| That's quite a – that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| Say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| If one goes back before Crossroads was open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| and Volunteer Ministry Center was operating their day room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| whenever the temperatures hit a certain point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| both on the hot side and on the cold side, when it hits freezing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| our chapel opens up, Salvation Army opens its doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| And so if we talk about the danger to the elements, none of that would actually change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| That will still be –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| Except that there has been a change in the sense that VMC is no longer –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1613)|
| 0:26:59| the day room is no longer open, the courtyard there is no longer available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| And knowing that, because I've been involved with that over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| that was where my concerns lie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| that we have lost what I consider to be a very nice, comfortable space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1632)|
| 0:27:19| Well, and if you look at the current level of cooperation amongst the three agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1639)|
| 0:27:26| what we've all concluded is that when white flag goes into effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| and that's when the temperatures and the weather creates that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| all three agencies, meaning us, VMC, and Salvation Army, will make their space available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| Salvation Army Gym, CARM in the chapel and in the Welcome Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| and VMC, where they have space as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| All three agencies have talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| When the weather hits that point, no one wants to see people outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| And that's reassuring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| Back to Councilman Booker's comments or question about Cooper Street there under the overpass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1675)|
| 0:28:02| Is that a possibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| I would have to go look at that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| Mr. Wetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| Just a quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| On the other side of Cooper Street, there's two large tracts of property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| One between Cooper Street back to the interstate is a very large tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| That's railroad right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| That property that's underneath the interstate would be TDOT right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| We haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| We don't have an agreement on that section of the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| and we don't have a section on the railroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| We have talked, in fact, with the railroad about that property in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| and they're just content with the way it is at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| Mr. Rosen, so I understand right now you all can accommodate approximately 175 people today, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1719)|
| 0:28:47| Not at any one given time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| But that's how many we have coming through our doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| Generally, when we open in the morning, 125 to 150 people are waiting to come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| So at this point, CARM is supportive of this ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| Let me clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| Supportive of the spirit of the intent of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| If you look at who it's going to impact, and I think Mr. Wetzel added a clarification there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| we, like everybody else in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| does not like seeing people setting out lounge chairs on the sidewalk and setting up camp for the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| Anything that would keep that from happening, we would indeed be in favor of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| As I've looked at some of the sanctions that are associated with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| it has caused me to wonder whether there may be other alternatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| such as a community service program that might offer alternatives to citations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| and ultimately perhaps spending a night or two in jail as a result of nonpayment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Chief Owen, a year and a half, two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| we passed an ordinance concerning aggressive panhandling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| Do you recall that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| And at the time, there were some very legitimate concerns that it was going to be very punitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1795)|
| 0:30:03| that people were going to be going to have their rights infringed upon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| that they were going to be hustled and hassled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| Do you know, I mean, how has implementation of that gone so far, Chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| I think it's gone very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| First of all, the people who were getting hassled, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| were the people who were saying that the panhandlers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| and whatnot were aggressively bothering them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| They were trying to eat at Market Square, things of this nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| and people were coming up and bothering them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| Once the ordinance was put into place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| and our officers went out and spoke with the individuals who were being accused of the panhandling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| or the aggressive panhandling, we've had very, very few instances that have created any problems at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| It was an education process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| Once they were educated, everyone knew what the rules were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| On average, if you know, how many people are cited for violating that ordinance every month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| If you'd give me a heads up, I would have gotten those stats for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| But I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| But I would say it's minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| Now, you talk about there is the educational process, which is proposed with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1864)|
| 0:31:10| And we've had educational processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| or time frames to go through for whether it's parking in front yards or traffic cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1872)|
| 0:31:20| Have those proven to be beneficial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| I mean, do you think that educational process will be beneficial in this circumstance as well, Chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| Well, I think it's like anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| When you talk to your children, if they're willing to listen, then there's a doggone good chance it will be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| Now, we're dealing with a specific group of individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| They will be informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| We have a 90-day period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| We intend to go out and be, you know, respectful and clear on what the new ordinance says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| But I think it will be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| I think it will be, you used the Panhandling Ordinance as an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| and I think that has proven to be an effective tool, and I believe this will too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| I'm going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| Counselor Whitehall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| I do understand the point that you're making about the Panhandling Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| but that seems to be a different item altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| That's aggressive behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| We're not talking about aggressive behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| We're not talking about behavior that's making somebody feel threatened or uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| We're actually talking about behavior that is currently legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| And I supported this ordinance the first go-around because I had this sense that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1945)|
| 0:32:32| I don't know what kind of sense I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| I had a sense that perhaps there was coordination on the street with what was going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1953)|
| 0:32:40| because if you're homeless, then that's your home where they're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| And, you know, Bert, you're a good friend, and you've been a good teacher to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1966)|
| 0:32:55| about all the nuances of your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1975)|
| 0:33:02| And it just seems like we need to do a better job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| If we are going to support people in a different direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| we need to do a better job of working with them to, first of all, hear their point of view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| and get their insight and feedback about what's about to take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| and then be real clear about the options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| and not just have responses about, like, I think this is happening and I think that's happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| but exactly what is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| Now, under the interstate, I think, doesn't lost sheep do things under the interstate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2012)|
| 0:33:38| And, I mean, every Wednesday night or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| So it feels like, one, we haven't really talked to the people who are going to be affected the most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2022)|
| 0:33:49| and then, two, we don't really have a clear plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| And it seems like we need to do that before we do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| It does also feel a little weird that you can't sit on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2036)|
| 0:34:04| You're still not impeding traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| That particular word sort of struck me as strange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| But basically my point is that I don't feel like we've really interacted with the community on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| and made a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| And I respect your opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| I would disagree with you, but I would respect your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| It's not an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| It's just an observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| So tell me what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| Well, we've coordinated and talked to the people on the street who provide services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| Yeah, but not the people themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| Audience, this is not joint participation, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| Please be respectful of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| And as this has evolved over time, we have developed plans, working with CARN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| to provide them for a place to move their parking, for an outside seating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| It could be placed at their facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| The TDOT project is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| We thought we might get that parking lot handed over to us a little quicker than it was, but it hasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| But we can still make do at this point in time, as Bert says, with that outdoor seating at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| So there's been planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| There's been coordination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| That's gone forward now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| You might not feel there's been enough of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| You might not feel there's been enough of it, but it has gone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| But everything you just said, it didn't sound like it really included the people on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| It sounded like you were talking about the providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| The folks who provide the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| I mean, the 10-year plan asked me to go out with those two guys from CAC, and we visited all the homeless camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2123)|
| 0:35:33| And when I was listening to the people who lived in the homeless camps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| they didn't come across or sound like they were real engaged with what was happening to them or for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2138)|
| 0:35:47| And that's what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| You know, what have we done, you know, to find out what they're thinking about what's about to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2149)|
| 0:35:58| And, you know, you've done public processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| You just have to let people be included in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| And it doesn't sound like we've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| But you're telling me that I'm wrong, that it has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| No, I'm not saying that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| I'm saying we have not done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| We've talked with the folks who provided the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| We've talked down on the street and said, what do you think about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2175)|
| 0:36:23| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| Councilman Batley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| I just want to follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| How many people or instances are we talking about on a daily basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| I mean, is there an estimate weekly or are we talking about five or ten a day or one or two a day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2192)|
| 0:36:39| You can drive down the 400 block of Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| And this goes on other places as well, but the 500 block, 400 block of Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| you may have five, ten, or 15 people at one time that sit there all day with their lawn chairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| depending on the weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| If the weather is real bad, they're not there typically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| And they're not all in the chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| Some are on the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| It varies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| And so when we talk about working with these folks that will be affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| and the accommodations that are going to be made and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| over the next 90 days do you feel like we could go out and visit with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| and discuss it with them and talk about what the options would be and so forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2234)|
| 0:37:20| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| When I think about this ordinance, I guess I think about the services that we are called as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2246)|
| 0:37:33| to provide for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| And one of those main services is infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| Safe roads, safe sidewalks, safe parks, safe places of passage for folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2259)|
| 0:37:46| And, you know, if folks were sitting or lying in the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| I think we would all agree that that wouldn't be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| The streets are for vehicular traffic, bicycle traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| and it needs to be unimpeded to be safe for everyone in the community who wants to use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2278)|
| 0:38:04| And I think of the sidewalks, particularly in a congested area like the CBID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| or the downtown north area, in much the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| The sidewalks are built for the safe passage of pedestrian, primarily pedestrian traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2292)|
| 0:38:18| and those who are visiting the businesses and the churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| and the establishments that are along those sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| And if we have folks that are using those sidewalks regularly as a place to congregate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2305)|
| 0:38:31| or to sit or to socialize for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| it's not safe for the purpose that that conduit is built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| just as a street wouldn't be safe if folks were in the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| And I know that this issue is more complex than just the movement of people and goods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| and visiting stores and churches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| but I do think it's one step in the right direction of our coordinated efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| to try to do a better job than we have been doing in meeting the needs of those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| who are homeless at any given time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| And I don't think we'll know how this will all play out entirely until we start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2346)|
| 0:39:12| but it's a step for me in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| And, again, I think it makes sense in terms of allowing our sidewalks to be a safe place of passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2356)|
| 0:39:22| so folks can walk from one business to another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| can visit the businesses that are along that area without the passageway being impeded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2366)|
| 0:39:34| We do have some speakers signed up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| I supported this ordinance last time, but I was not aware of the unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2379)|
| 0:39:46| And until we can really address those with some kind of dates in mind or proposed dates in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2386)|
| 0:39:53| I will not support it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2393)|
| 0:40:01| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| Councilman Nordholm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| Just real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| I agree with many of the statements that Councilman Roddy made, sort of, most of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2405)|
| 0:40:13| But I think we have to do the right thing the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| And we have to get out there and talk to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| Because apparently the way it's being used now is legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| It may not be the optimal use, but apparently they're using it in a way that is acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2425)|
| 0:40:35| I understand visually it's not acceptable to some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| And I also understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| And I live near there, and I go up and down that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| So I understand that the idea behind this ordinance is moving perhaps in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2442)|
| 0:40:52| But we're going to have to do a little bit more groundwork with the people, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| That's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| Going back to the folks who are signed up to speak then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| the next person signed up to speak in favor is Virginia Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2464)|
| 0:41:10| Sir, we're going to go by the agenda here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2470)|
| 0:41:17| Are you here for a reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| Yeah, I was going to say so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| Well, you have to sign in, and I'm next, and you make me nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| Right up there, the girl in white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| And you make me nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| Go ahead, Ms. Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| If you'd give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| My name is Virginia Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| I live at 918 Grant Street, which is in Forth and Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| I am here to speak as a member of the Happy Hollow Old House Restoration Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2497)|
| 0:41:44| and we are part of Happy Hollow Business Area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| And we have some pictures which are being passed around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| This ordinance, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| gives the police the way to move people that are hanging in doorways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2516)|
| 0:42:05| and defecating in doorways and sleeping when we're trying to open a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2525)|
| 0:42:12| And the pictures are going around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| This is one of them right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| This is what Time Warp has to put up with when he's trying to open his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2536)|
| 0:42:23| Now, this ordinance, as far as I can read it, gives the police the authority to warn these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2543)|
| 0:42:32| and there aren't a lot of them, but they are habitual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| and to warn these people that they may not do this, they may not rule this town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2557)|
| 0:42:44| and they may not throttle the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| And nobody's speaking for the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| And if we don't help the businesses, all the work, the facade program, all of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2571)|
| 0:42:58| if people can't get to them, we have wasted a whole lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| And I urge that we do pass this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| and that we do have outreach, more outreach if we need it, to reach all these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2589)|
| 0:43:16| But you have to understand there are very few people that are living on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2596)|
| 0:43:23| that we see all day long as we go up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| I probably make ten trips a day up and down Broadway for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| And they don't need to inhibit all the businesses that we are trying to make flourish in this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2611)|
| 0:43:41| This, to me, is a pro-business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| and it gives the police an opportunity to have a way of saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2623)|
| 0:43:50| if you stay here again, we can do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| Okay, Counsel, I have five people signed up to speak against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| The rules are three people for five minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| Do you have any direction for the Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| Hearing none, it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| We'd stick to our rule unless somebody wants to propose something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| Why don't we hear from all of them and just cut the time down somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| I'm going to ask that we have five people signed up to speak against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| By our rules, we're supposed to have three that all get five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| I'm going to ask, let everybody who signed up come speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| But, Councilman Hall, the motion, I guess we need to vote on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| but the motion is to do that but ask each speaker to remember the overall time limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| so we can keep it within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| Make it three minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| Maybe think more toward a three-minute limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| Is that what Councilman Hall said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| So, we will let everybody speak that signed up to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| The motion, second, is to do five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| Let all speak with a three-minute time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| All in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| The first signed up speaker opposed is Linda Mayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2693)|
| 0:45:01| I'm sorry, it might be Lida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| I'm sorry, Lida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Lida, if you would give us your name and address, please, as you start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| Lida Mayer, 4721 Clark Drive, 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2707)|
| 0:45:15| I'm very much against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| I've known people who were either on the edge of homeless or homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| I've been closer than I'd like a few times myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| But one problem with tucking people under bridges and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| one problem these people have all too often is that they're already too invisible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| If we put them out of sight, then we don't have to deal with them anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| We don't have to have infrastructure in place if we can just hide them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| If we build it first, then maybe they won't have a desire to be on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| And if you have one place they can go, how are they going to get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| Many of them have physical problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| They don't have the cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| And if you find the sidewalks blocked when you happen to be walking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2762)|
| 0:46:12| if you were walking all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| you might be even more inclined to run into people you know and stop to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2775)|
| 0:46:20| if you weren't driving from place to place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| We interact with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| We all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| If any of us stop to visit with a friend we run into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| we're going to be subject to being arrested if we're not wearing the right clothes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| I think that's, you know, bottom line what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| It's a discriminatory law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| You know, I would recommend that the people here go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| Do a field trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| Go out and talk to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| And, yeah, ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| They're not here because they have to sign up if they want to bed tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| They can't really be here for these meetings very readily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| without making some big sacrifices that you don't have to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| But you can go to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| You have better transportation to get to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| You don't have to walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| And we had a pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| You know, we were looking at liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2829)|
| 0:47:16| For all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2836)|
| 0:47:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| Rick, I think it's Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2852)|
| 0:47:39| Rick Roach, 2404 Victoria Avenue, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| Several weeks ago I attended the Mayor's Luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| We had several organizations that are represented here now on about the 10-year plan to end homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2868)|
| 0:47:54| I had the privilege of attending that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| And the one thing that really got me was the fact that the emphasis was on personal interaction, as Lida mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2877)|
| 0:48:07| That's the key here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| You know, the main question we should consider as citizens and as council people, are we our brothers' keepers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2889)|
| 0:48:18| our brothers' and sisters' keepers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| And that should be the overriding thing that we should be considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| And that answer is yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| So this ordinance doesn't speak to that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| It says I'm going to take people that kind of get in the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| I'm going to push them aside, push them here, push them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| We've already got laws in place to enforce people who are not being civil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2919)|
| 0:48:46| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| But the fact is we have homeless people, and the fact is we don't deal with them well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| We don't accommodate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| We don't stop and say, can I help your brother?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| And until we start to do that and address it on that level, then we're going to have the same issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2938)|
| 0:49:04| This ordinance will not take care of any of these problems that people spoke about so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2944)|
| 0:49:10| I urge you to, at the very least, table this ordinance for future consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2950)|
| 0:49:16| Do your homework as council people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| Get the numbers that you need to consider this justly and humanely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2958)|
| 0:49:25| and then come back with something that fits in with the mayor's 10-year plan to end homelessness in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2965)|
| 0:49:33| Can I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| You said get the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| You're talking about some sort of metrics, some measurement of something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| What were you referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| Councilman Frost brought up the issue of how many people have been arrested under certain issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| Clarification of those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| And that's essential for you to be able to make a good decision in terms of how do we help these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2991)|
| 0:49:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| If I could, Mr. Shane Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| I need to stick to the folks who signed up in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| We still need to stick to the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| If we have some time, I'll let you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| I have 60 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| I'll let you have it at the end, but I have people that have signed up first, and then we'll come back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3016)|
| 0:50:33| My name is Tim Macklin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| My address is 307 McCormick, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3034)|
| 0:50:40| And, you know, I'd like to say most of all is, you know, I really appreciated the prayer that we started out with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3040)|
| 0:50:46| That's awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| One nation under God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| And, you know, if we go to God's word, I was homeless myself three and a half years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| and I was living in a condemned house, a van.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| And God has changed my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| And, you know, these people, you know, I see where Nashville is buying them bicycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| You know, that's not going to help these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| What they need, they need somebody to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| They need a hand up, not a hand out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| They need somebody spiritual that will help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| I do a Party for Jesus every Saturday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| It's called God's Place Party for Jesus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| We feed anywhere from 200 to 300 people every Saturday night, you know, with the money that God has given me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3075)|
| 0:51:21| My job, I took out of my pocket and bought three buses and three vans, handicapped vans, to help these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3081)|
| 0:51:27| These folks know me by my name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| I pull in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3089)|
| 0:51:30| I talk to them every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| I go down through town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| I know these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| I love those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| I hug them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| They're my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| There's some homeless here today that has sacrificed their meal to come down here and support just what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3096)|
| 0:51:43| You know, these, I mean, but, you know, what it takes, even Korm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| I mean, I thank God for Korm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| But it's not a, you know, they get on to me if I'm 10 minutes after 9 o'clock bringing these folks in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3108)|
| 0:51:55| But when you've got five people down here getting saved, you know, you can't stop it right then and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3115)|
| 0:51:59| hey, look here, you can't get saved because they need you in at 9 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| And, you know, these people, they've been beat down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| They've been pushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| I mean, they've been persecuted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| I mean, they've been, but what they need, they need somebody to teach them that somebody cares about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| You know, I've got a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| There's people right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| I've got people all over this house, a group of people that will help these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| But I can't do it on my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| I mean, they're giving away these schools and these elementary schools that they don't know what they're going to do with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3142)|
| 0:52:28| I mean, I would take a responsibility to have a place, a gymnasium, preaching the Word of God every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3148)|
| 0:52:35| I was a drug addict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| I used to be a junkie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| I used to smoke crack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3157)|
| 0:52:38| But God has changed my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| And I've been where these guys is at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| And I was being pronounced dead twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| My casket's been bought once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| My bitch has raised it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| But God told me go to the poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| And, you know, the thing about it is that's one of the reasons why God destroyed the city of Sodom and Gomorrah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| the way they oppressed the poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| And, you know, when we do these things, when we come against the poor, what we're doing, we're putting a curse on this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3176)|
| 0:53:01| And this needs to be reversed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| We need to show love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3183)|
| 0:53:04| Where did Jesus go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| He didn't preach in the synagogues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| He went to the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| He preached to the prostitutes, the drunkens, the people that needed help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| He didn't come to call the righteous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| He called the sinners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| And that's what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| You know, the Bible talks about in Matthew 26, 11, for we'll have the poor with us always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3197)|
| 0:53:24| And they're going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| But what they need, they need, there's good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| I've got two guys with me right now that was homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| I've been housing 10, 12 people on my properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| Anything I could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| I bought tents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| Like I said, I was homeless three and a half years ago myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| But everything I've made, I've tried to give to these poor folks and help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| And I've got a house that I let them live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| But, I mean, there's no, I mean, they have to live right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| They've got a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| If you want to live, if you want to abide by the rules, I've got a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| But I need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| I mean, I can't do it on my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| My roofing company just don't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| I mean, we need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| But I'm telling you, I've got a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| And we've got a group of people, there's church people, that comes and help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| They help feed the poor every Saturday night and hand out clothes and bring clothes and spend their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3249)|
| 0:54:15| And we've got people to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| But we can't do it on our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| Vonda Morris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3260)|
| 0:54:30| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| Yes, Vonda Morris, and I live at 418 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| I live at the Mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| And I would just like to say that the only place I see people sitting, I mean, I go downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3278)|
| 0:54:44| I've been job hunting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| I'm downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| I'm down Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| The only place I see people sitting is in front of the Mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| And that's their home, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| My mother, I met with her Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| We went to church, and I was telling her about what was happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| And she even mentioned, well, this is y'all's home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| Why can't you sit on the sidewalk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| And I have been here a month, and I have very much pursued a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3306)|
| 0:55:13| And it's 90 degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| I'm dressing in dress clothes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| I'm walking to find me a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| And I do sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| I mean, I have to sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| So, I mean, you know, I probably won't be approached if I'm dressed like you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3321)|
| 0:55:27| But if I'm dressed like a street person and sitting down, then I'm going to be approached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3327)|
| 0:55:35| As far as lawn chairs and blankets, I don't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| Y'all drive up and down Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| And there's really no businesses on North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| There's the paint company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| I mean, they're not blocking anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| We're not blocking anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| I mean, we're sitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| That's our home at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| And that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| The gentleman who wanted to sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| Yeah, if you'd come on back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3362)|
| 0:56:03| If you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| I'm Shane Wilson from 1823 Prospect Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| I just wanted to bring to the Council's attention that in June of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| a ruling in Multnomah County Circuit Court in Portland, Oregon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| declared their version of the Sidewalk Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| which the Knoxville Ordinance is modeled after unconstitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3381)|
| 0:56:25| In reference to his ruling, Judge Stephen K. Bouchon stated, and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3385)|
| 0:56:31| In the United States, we fundamentally respect the rights of individuals to meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| to assemble, to communicate, and to use public property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| And the city's attempts at curtailing those fundamental rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| have been unconstitutional every step of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| Here in Knoxville, many of us feel the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3411)|
| 0:56:56| We'll let one more speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| I was signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| Are you Ryan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3424)|
| 0:57:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| Please go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| My name is Ryan Bliss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3429)|
| 0:57:10| I live at 1210 Bridge Avenue in Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| When I first heard of this, I was pretty annoyed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| because the article I was reading in the Sentinel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3436)|
| 0:57:21| did not talk about the people that I've interacted with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| I've volunteered for the group Food Not Bombs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| which has served hungry people for, I think, since 1994 in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3449)|
| 0:57:38| And the people I've talked to, there's not too many happy stories about being homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3458)|
| 0:57:43| It's not like a lawn chair experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3463)|
| 0:57:49| And, I mean, like the people that are here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| they're not going to go home to a place in a soft bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3473)|
| 0:58:00| And that's the same truth when an officer comes up to them on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| and tells them to stop sitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| They can't go home and lay down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| There's no place for people to sit or lay besides the select few places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3489)|
| 0:58:14| And what if they don't like those places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| Where then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| And I just thought more shallow thinking about dealing with homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3499)|
| 0:58:24| My gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| One issue I thought about was, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| I often see a lot of people being attended to on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| who have passed out of heat exhaustion and various other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3512)|
| 0:58:37| And these people are not going to want to be on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| And there's going to be people passing out in parks where people are not seeing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3520)|
| 0:58:45| I think there's going to be some people dying if this is put up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| because people are not going to be out visible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| and nobody's going to know that they're having a heart attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| And the hottest month of the year is coming, August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| And if this is put in place now, then that's right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3538)|
| 0:59:04| And just the whole factor about being issued citations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3544)|
| 0:59:10| a lot of homeless people cannot pay the $50 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| And that just doesn't make sense to be trying to issue those because, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3555)|
| 0:59:21| so they don't pay the fine, they go to jail, and that's taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| And that's going to be coming up a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| And so this money could be used to help businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3571)|
| 0:59:37| I mean, things could be put into place to help businesses in other ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| that don't take people off the street who live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| And it's just disrespectful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| I've heard people talk about life in emissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| and it's hard because there's a lot of thievery that goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3591)|
| 0:59:57| There's fights, and it's loud, and it's crowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| I mean, there's a lot of mentally ill homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| and the crowds are just too much for a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3603)|
| 1:00:08| And so this is not going to end homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| I saw that it was recommended by the council to end chronic homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3611)|
| 1:00:18| and it's not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| It's going to reinforce the notion that this world does not care about these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| And I thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| Let me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3627)|
| 1:00:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| Comments from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| Bobby, do you have something you want to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| I'm not sure if I have anything to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| I just want to reemphasize that clearly the city is committed to working on the homeless issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| We work on that all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| You guys know how hard that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| You'll have a big issue in front of you here next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| really working on how to house the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| It's a very tough issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| This is a small part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| The element issue doesn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| The element issue in this one doesn't change at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| Folks on the sidewalk, either on Broadway or on the bridge at Gay or wherever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| they're not under shelter now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| That issue doesn't change with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| There are places for people to go and sit right now at CARM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3675)|
| 1:01:19| This is the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| The dynamic that's on the 400 block of Broadway, it's a hard thing to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| and I appreciate the position you all are in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| because the weakest and the poorest among us are out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| and we're trying to do the right things in lots of different ways to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| That's not a good environment out there in a lot of places for folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| We're trying to take the right steps in the right direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| and we think this is a step that will help after education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3703)|
| 1:01:44| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| I'd like to ask the law director a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| Earlier, one of the gentlemen spoke against a case in Oregon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3708)|
| 1:01:55| Obviously, being a lawyer myself, I'm interested in whether or not things are constitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3715)|
| 1:02:02| How applicable, unless that's a Supreme Court decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| a case in Oregon isn't controlling on Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| How does that, if you're familiar with it, how does that case apply to what's being proposed tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3731)|
| 1:02:18| We are familiar with that case, and we've read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| I would say that there are many distinguishing factors with the Oregon law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| and the Tennessee law as we've construed it, and that is a local decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| and I would not find that applicable to our situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| Other questions from members of Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3755)|
| 1:02:41| This gentleman would like to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| Our public comment time is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| If you would like to make something real brief, I'll make one exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| If you want to set the time for comments in the crowd, and we have other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| So, Council, I guess I need some guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| I see other people that are wanting to talk to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| Would somebody like to make a motion or leave it by our current rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| And I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| I know people want to speak, but there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| I'd like to hear him speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| I would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| Could the Chair maybe propose then we'll let anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| maybe we'll let an additional two or three people speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| but ask you to keep it to one minute or less since we've already kind of gone past our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| If you'd give us your name and address, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| My name is Timothy Blackwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| I live at 420 East Churchwell Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3804)|
| 1:03:30| I, too, I was homeless, and my address is now as I have spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| And I used to stay at the Karma, and I went down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| I was still in their system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| Before I got a job, I used to go down there to use the phone services in order to get jobs and to call for jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3822)|
| 1:03:53| Now, the day I went down there, and this is one of the citations that I was written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3833)|
| 1:04:01| I come out of Karma, go up the sidewalk, a police unit has pulled over and stopped everybody on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3841)|
| 1:04:11| And his statement was that someone that was on that sidewalk had an open container.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3851)|
| 1:04:18| And he told us if someone don't step up and take a $50 ticket, everyone will be issued a $500 one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3858)|
| 1:04:28| So he randomly picked three people and gave them $50 tickets for an open container, and this is one of the citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3868)|
| 1:04:36| And on this citation is my 420 East Churchwell Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3876)|
| 1:04:42| I don't live at the Karma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| I don't live at the Mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| So talking about the city on this, the citations, do you feel like that's right, Chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3886)|
| 1:04:53| Because the officer gave everyone a ticket, and it was about 15 people on that sidewalk at that present time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3893)|
| 1:04:59| I was just coming out of Karma, going back up Broadway to go back down Central to Churchwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3899)|
| 1:05:05| and I was written a citation, and I didn't even have an open container.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3905)|
| 1:05:11| Did you not have enough money in your wallet or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| Well, I mean, I think, I don't, Chief, I don't, I'm not certain that caused anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3917)|
| 1:05:23| So this next gentleman is next, and, again, I'd ask both of you to keep it to one minute or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| If you could give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3927)|
| 1:05:28| Thank you, Mayor, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| Patrick William Beck, currently 418 North Broadway at the Rescue Mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| Now, I will briefly interject that I have road rail and done the highways from Ketchikan, Alaska, to Austin, Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3935)|
| 1:05:47| Your problems are not the first, and relatively, I believe it begins with the place that you did put the missions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3947)|
| 1:06:00| But anyway, I just wanted to correct these gentlemen and inform the Council that the day center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| and I've been here for four days, is approximately 20 by 20 with a urinal, one for the woman, one for the man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3965)|
| 1:06:15| Now, he put in 175 as the projected daily people that walk through those doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3975)|
| 1:06:22| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| Now, it's mainly to use the phones because you only have currently four phones, four seats to use one phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3984)|
| 1:06:31| four seats to use the other phone, and there's probably 53, if I'm not wrong, for people to sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3991)|
| 1:06:39| So you've got 175 people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| The rules in there are mainly to use a phone or check your bag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| And I check my main backpack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| Now I have my day bag because I have to eat if I can't make it back to the mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4009)|
| 1:06:54| You are not allowed to have that bag in there due to past problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4014)|
| 1:06:59| This is the present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| There's just too many rules, and a working man or a person that's trying to, you know, better himself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4021)|
| 1:07:10| there's people, I believe, that have forgotten where they came from, and they're using the name of the Lord in the wrong way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4030)|
| 1:07:18| I just want to correct that about the day room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| There's no place for people to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| One last speaker for one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4049)|
| 1:07:30| Please go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4050)|
| 1:07:31| I think you're next, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| I come here on a rezoning issue, but I understand this homeless situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4054)|
| 1:07:38| I used to work up U.T. and did a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| I need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4062)|
| 1:07:43| My name is Doug Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| I live at 2201 Marthbury Drive, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| This homeless situation is a difficult situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| And you've got people that really don't want help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| There are some, but very few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| Now, this panhandling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| Now, if a man is going into a man's business and disrupting his business and pestering for money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4082)|
| 1:08:09| and he's interfering with his business, I'd say give him a ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4089)|
| 1:08:14| But this business, I've never seen the homeless pile up on a sidewalk where people cannot walk past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4094)|
| 1:08:20| And I agree totally, and I'm opposed to the whole darn thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| That's all I want to say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| I'm gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4106)|
| 1:08:31| Any other comments from council members or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| I will say one thing, and I appreciate the audience being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| And what you should know is this council, this is homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| This isn't something we thought up that we're going to try to clean up the streets of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| This city and this council has worked incredibly hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| Four weeks from now, there will be another meeting about trying to establish a site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| to have long-term supported housing for folks who are homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| Now, the city is spending millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| That's not an exaggeration, millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| It will be a site that we're trying to work out in a neighborhood, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| And there will be an audience full of people saying, we don't want that, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4146)|
| 1:09:10| And so, the city is in a hard position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| We really do want to solve what's a tragic problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| And there's people, we have a group of people working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| We're devoting an incredible amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| But it's not as simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| If we had, if this had been, if this had, people know maybe, gosh, there's going to be a lot of people show up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4163)|
| 1:09:29| there could have been just as easily a whole equal amount of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| from neighborhoods around there showing up to say, we really need this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4172)|
| 1:09:35| And so, everybody on council would tell you, I wish it was as simple as saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4175)|
| 1:09:39| you either care or you don't care because that's not it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| We care incredibly and we're spending a lot of money as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| We're devoting a lot of time and effort to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| So, you do need to put the whole, like I said, four weeks from now, we'll be back here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4187)|
| 1:09:50| and it will be a whole different discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4190)|
| 1:09:52| It's the same issue, homelessness, but it will be a whole different discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| So, please know that there's a complexity to this that can't be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| framed up just in a saying or a sign or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| So, any other comments from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| It is a complex issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| It's very complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| And it makes it an extremely difficult position for us to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4212)|
| 1:10:18| There are two sides to everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4218)|
| 1:10:24| You know, spent a lot of time at the Mission over a period of ten years, one full day a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4224)|
| 1:10:33| and very, very familiar with folks that really have nowhere to go except the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4233)|
| 1:10:43| and can't see any way out of their situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4243)|
| 1:10:48| and know a lot of people who have been engaged for a long time in trying to change that for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4248)|
| 1:10:55| because they care, because they love people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| We have other people that are working so hard to hang on to their small businesses in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4259)|
| 1:11:09| and it's very difficult to do that in times like now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| So, it really calls on all of us in my mind, and I know this isn't as simple as I'm going to make it sound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4274)|
| 1:11:22| for us to not just think about ourselves, but think of the other person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4282)|
| 1:11:28| And if you were that person that had just gotten a job and just worked in a small business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4288)|
| 1:11:33| and they were trying to hang on to it and trying to keep giving you a paycheck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4293)|
| 1:11:38| and yet there was a situation outside your doors that made it difficult for people to come in and do business there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4298)|
| 1:11:45| you know, pretty soon you'd lose your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| Pretty soon that person who is trying to run that business would lose their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4307)|
| 1:11:55| Now, as a council, we're put in a position of trying to think about everybody, all of you, and care about all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4315)|
| 1:12:06| I'm very disappointed that more definite arrangements are not scheduled for better facilities for folks that need to be off the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4326)|
| 1:12:23| But I think you all realize that the street belongs to everybody, and the street and the sidewalks are there for everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4343)|
| 1:12:33| for you to be safe, for you to be able to move about as you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4353)|
| 1:12:41| But in order to do that, we have to make sure that we don't present any danger to other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4361)|
| 1:12:48| So understand that we all have a responsibility to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4368)|
| 1:12:52| And I think it's that give and take thing about justice for all of us that we have to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4372)|
| 1:13:00| So I think this is going to be, I'm a person who really believes that if these three agencies that are attempting so to provide services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4380)|
| 1:13:12| to allow folks to find jobs, to find housing, and then to, as someone said, put behind some of the issues that are keeping us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4392)|
| 1:13:25| from being successful, then we can be working, we can have a job, we can give to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4405)|
| 1:13:31| That's the whole point of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4411)|
| 1:13:35| So I tend to think that in order to be able to support everybody, all of you who have come tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4415)|
| 1:13:43| who want so to voice your feelings and your needs, and also those agencies that have made it their business to try to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4423)|
| 1:13:53| for those who are seeking help there, and then for those business people who are feeding the tax base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4433)|
| 1:14:03| and paying the taxes that allow the city to operate as it does, I just feel like we all need to realize it's a team effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4443)|
| 1:14:12| And we're all going to have to do something to try to work together and work through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4452)|
| 1:14:20| So you all have good voices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| You speak well for your position and your concerns about things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4463)|
| 1:14:28| This isn't something that just gets solved tonight and we all just run away and forget about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4468)|
| 1:14:34| We're going to continue to work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| And I would just really plead with all of us to continue to be engaged in this, because it's not going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4476)|
| 1:14:43| And many of you are very young and have all the possibilities out ahead of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4483)|
| 1:14:49| So help us to work this out so that it is going to be fair to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4489)|
| 1:14:56| And I won't tell you how I'm going to vote on this, but that may be a little sermon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4496)|
| 1:15:05| My kids and my grandkids would all say, sounds just like you, Nana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| But somehow I think we all need to be reminded that it's our response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4509)|
| 1:15:14| We are our brother's keeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| I truly believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| It has a great deal to do with why I serve on this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| It has been an awesome opportunity and experience, but it's a challenge also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4522)|
| 1:15:28| So I call on all of us to be our brother's keeper and to do what's best for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4528)|
| 1:15:34| And that means sometimes having to make some changes in our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4534)|
| 1:15:40| Thank you, Mayor Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4541)|
| 1:15:42| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4542)|
| 1:15:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| We're talking about, as Councilman Hochul has said, metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4545)|
| 1:15:49| If this passes, you know, in some circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4549)|
| 1:15:52| members of council are sent e-mails on a weekly basis or a quarterly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4552)|
| 1:15:59| Would you all please provide council monthly basis if this passes the amount of warnings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4559)|
| 1:16:07| or if there are any citations that are issued as a result of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4567)|
| 1:16:12| so council could see what, if any, infractions have occurred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4572)|
| 1:16:19| We can do that within our records management system, crime analysis, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4579)|
| 1:16:24| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4585)|
| 1:16:26| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4586)|
| 1:16:27| One thing, you know, when we talked about the panhandling ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| and I believe this discussion came up at that time, but my recollection could be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4590)|
| 1:16:36| There was discussion if that ordinance was oppressive, if that ordinance was unfair and unjust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4596)|
| 1:16:46| it could certainly be rescinded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4606)|
| 1:16:52| If this passes and if the statistics that the police department provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4612)|
| 1:16:58| members of council and the administration reflect that, I think it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| I'd be the first person to try to rescind this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| But, you know, I patronize the paint store in the vicinity, the Time Warp, Tea Room, the Freezo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4627)|
| 1:17:16| and the other businesses that are in this area and that are, you know, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4636)|
| 1:17:21| being affected by the current situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4641)|
| 1:17:26| And it's most unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| I've had a lot of harps come to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4648)|
| 1:17:31| And, you know, receiving emails from people in adjoining neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4651)|
| 1:17:38| If this was an easy solution, it would have been taken care of a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| I do not know that this is, you know, will be the best thing since sliced bread, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4662)|
| 1:17:49| But there needs to be an effort to find a balance in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4669)|
| 1:17:56| and to respectfully submit to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| I intend to support this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| If this passes, I will scrutinize carefully the statistics that we receive to see if it is beneficial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4681)|
| 1:18:10| or if it serves as a burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4690)|
| 1:18:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| I appreciate all the comments, Councilman Pilo's comments and Councilman Frost's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4697)|
| 1:18:23| I find myself agreeing with Councilman Frost, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4703)|
| 1:18:29| I hear the concerns that are expressed by people in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| I think they're legitimate concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| I've also read some on the issue and how it's impacted other cities when there has been a lack of enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4714)|
| 1:18:43| under these conditions or lack of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| Los Angeles comes to mind and the problems that have been created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| So I don't think the problems that are supposedly being addressed by this ordinance can be ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4730)|
| 1:18:58| At the same time, I think that the concerns about how the people most impacted by the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4738)|
| 1:19:05| the concerns that have been expressed tonight have to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4745)|
| 1:19:11| In addition to what Councilman Frost has suggested, I would say that it might be possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4751)|
| 1:19:16| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| Mr. Chief, you may need to reply to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4757)|
| 1:19:21| If council expresses a will to set up a time period where there are only warnings issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4761)|
| 1:19:29| and it's an educational slot of time, whether it's two weeks, six weeks, whatever it may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4769)|
| 1:19:37| where officers just, as they encounter people in these circumstances where they might otherwise find them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4777)|
| 1:19:42| they don't initially take action on the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| but they just inform those people that this is going to take effect at some point per the will of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4785)|
| 1:19:52| I don't know if that's a problem legally or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| The law director may need to step in and say something about that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4795)|
| 1:19:58| But I'm just wondering if we could do something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4798)|
| 1:20:04| and that also would buy us some time in terms of CARM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| and other organizations preparing for the implementation of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4808)|
| 1:20:12| I believe we had already addressed that we were talking about a 90-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| Yeah, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| That is in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4817)|
| 1:20:18| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4818)|
| 1:20:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4819)|
| 1:20:20| Councilman Frost just pointed it out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4820)|
| 1:20:21| I'd forgotten that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| Again, I think Councilman Frost put it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| There's no perfect solution and no easy solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| But I think if we just say there's no solution and, therefore, we shouldn't do anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4831)|
| 1:20:37| I don't know that it serves anyone well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| including the populations of people that may be most impacted by the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4839)|
| 1:20:46| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4846)|
| 1:20:47| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4847)|
| 1:20:48| I appreciate your comments and those of Coach Wetzel because of the way I look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4848)|
| 1:20:52| I do think this is another small step in caring for those that need assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4852)|
| 1:20:59| and I think this is being done in a way that is more caring than in a negative fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4859)|
| 1:21:08| To speak to Councilman Hulk's question about the 90 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4868)|
| 1:21:12| and, Councilman Woodhull, your concern was that you didn't maybe feel that there was enough time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4872)|
| 1:21:17| where we've gone out and met with those that could be potentially affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4877)|
| 1:21:23| And so I'm not sure how the vote's going to take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4883)|
| 1:21:27| but I'm confident in the next 90 days that we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| And Coach Wetzel said he believes that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| and I think with the population that we're dealing with, I think that's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4894)|
| 1:21:39| But I do think this is another small step in the right direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| and I know, you know, when I came on Council, this was a very difficult situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| the issue of chronic homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| and I think we've put a lot of money to back it up and we've put a lot of effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| a lot of smart work and a lot of hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| And I think the people that are dealing with this, including the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4916)|
| 1:22:02| you know, their heart is in the right place, and so I too plan to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4922)|
| 1:22:08| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4928)|
| 1:22:09| Let me go to Councilman Booker since he hadn't spoken yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| I guess I'm right in the middle of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4933)|
| 1:22:17| Last time I voted, like I guess all of us, for the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4937)|
| 1:22:23| but I cannot vote for it this evening because we need to put some things in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4943)|
| 1:22:30| I think those organizations need to seriously consider a facility for these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4950)|
| 1:22:37| I'm in the middle because, unlike some people who have spoken tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4957)|
| 1:22:42| I have seen the people sitting and lying on the sidewalk at the corner of Gay and Depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4962)|
| 1:22:48| I see them at the corner of Depot and Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| and I see them everywhere else many times a week as I go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4972)|
| 1:22:57| And we must do something about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| but we just can't pass an ordinance saying get off the street without having some place for them to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4980)|
| 1:23:08| And, you know, it's nice to write tickets, but, Chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4988)|
| 1:23:13| I don't think you need your jail filled up with homeless people when we've got so many crooks running around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4993)|
| 1:23:19| So I just can't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| I can't support it until we put some mechanism in place to accommodate these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5002)|
| 1:23:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| Councilman Hooklass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5010)|
| 1:23:31| Well, following my previous comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| I just want to say parenthetically that the other concern we've heard, I don't think it was articulated tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5013)|
| 1:23:38| but we've heard in emails from some of the folks in Old North neighborhood, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5018)|
| 1:23:43| is how is this going to impact their community and similar communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| Will it drive people into the alleyways, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5027)|
| 1:23:51| And I think those are legitimate concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| I don't know how it's going to play out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| but I think we have to have some measure of vigilance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5035)|
| 1:23:59| and some mechanism to try to determine whether or not those are significant impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| And going back to Councilman Frost's previous statement, whether or not we need to revisit this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5044)|
| 1:24:09| I think if we do pass it tonight, I think we need to monitor it very closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5049)|
| 1:24:13| and be ready to modify it or even rescind if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5053)|
| 1:24:19| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| Chief, one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| I've read the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5062)|
| 1:24:23| Does it provide for jail time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5063)|
| 1:24:27| It seems to me it's a $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| It does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5069)|
| 1:24:30| It's a civil penalty of $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| And if you don't pay, what happens to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5074)|
| 1:24:40| Debbie, do you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5080)|
| 1:24:46| Then the city court goes through its collection effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5086)|
| 1:24:51| But if I ain't got it, what do you do to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| It's like any other bad debt of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| Seeing no other lights, are you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| We don't have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5102)|
| 1:25:03| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| There's not a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5104)|
| 1:25:05| Excuse me, Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5105)|
| 1:25:06| It's been moved and approved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| Mayor, may I make just one comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5110)|
| 1:25:11| Just real brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5111)|
| 1:25:12| As I've listened to the dialogue, CARM's role in all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| and I did not come tonight to speak for or against the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| We're merely trying to offer a compassionate alternative to the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| But I would not want the council to believe that the weight of this plan falls on CARM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5122)|
| 1:25:27| This is a community issue, and we really can only address it as the community as a whole participates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| Mr. Mayor, here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| Now, on whom does it fall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5135)|
| 1:25:39| You know, what organization is working on this facility we're talking about to get people off the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5139)|
| 1:25:46| They can't be in the day room during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5146)|
| 1:25:49| They want to be outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5149)|
| 1:25:50| Now, who is doing what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| And that's the question I raised initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| Who's doing what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5155)|
| 1:26:01| I think Bart makes a great point when he says this is a community issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| and it falls on all of us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| He has a facility that can handle folks at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| There are other facilities in this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| We have other public places in this town folks can go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| Is there an organized plan to put a – there's been a lot of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| and a lot of effort to create places for folks to go over the last period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5178)|
| 1:26:23| And it is a community issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| Councilman Hoekstra – or, excuse me, Councilman Woodhull, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5186)|
| 1:26:29| I'm right in the middle with Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| I don't think we've done enough ground work working with the people on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5193)|
| 1:26:40| I just don't think we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| Now, I sponsored the Panhandling Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5202)|
| 1:26:46| and we as a community have come to the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5206)|
| 1:26:52| and we want to deal with being our brother's keeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5212)|
| 1:26:59| But it just seems like there's a missing piece of us being on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5219)|
| 1:27:04| with the people finding out what are their concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5224)|
| 1:27:09| and even using some of their insight about what the next steps are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5229)|
| 1:27:14| I don't hear any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| Before I co-sponsored the Panhandling Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5236)|
| 1:27:20| I took my bike down on Central or Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5240)|
| 1:27:26| and talked to some of the people and asked them for their insight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| I just don't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5250)|
| 1:27:31| I just don't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5251)|
| 1:27:32| We need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5252)|
| 1:27:33| It's not about getting data around arrests and information like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5253)|
| 1:27:40| It's about including the point of view of the people who are being impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5260)|
| 1:27:45| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5265)|
| 1:27:49| Councilman Pilow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| Well, you know, I feel terribly in the middle of this too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| because I believe this is a very important ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| I feel it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| I feel like it's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| And I spoke to everybody in regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| However, we have not prepared the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5286)|
| 1:28:15| This is a community issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| And I don't know that the community is prepared to know how they're going to respond in a humane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5297)|
| 1:28:27| and in a considerate way for the changes that we're making for these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5307)|
| 1:28:34| And I think I was going under a very strong sense that because I have believed that CARM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5314)|
| 1:28:42| and VMC and Salvation Army have committed themselves to resolving these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5322)|
| 1:28:48| and because in the past there has been a day facility until VMC moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5328)|
| 1:28:55| And I was not at all prepared personally for them to no longer have the courtyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5335)|
| 1:29:02| I believe that was discussed when they talked about their move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| and their plans for that new facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| So, you know, I'm very troubled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| I understand Mr. Rosen wanting to present a disclaimer in regard to CARM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5351)|
| 1:29:17| But, Mr. Wetzel, I know you very well and you know me very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5357)|
| 1:29:25| and this just doesn't feel right to me that we haven't made some arrangements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5365)|
| 1:29:32| When we have talked over the last several months with these folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5372)|
| 1:29:36| with the service providers in this area, the idea has been, yes, this is a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5376)|
| 1:29:43| and, yes, we can support it, and, yes, by working with CARM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5383)|
| 1:29:46| there's a day room facility there that can handle most of the overflow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5386)|
| 1:29:50| We're talking 10 folks a day sitting on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| We're not talking hundreds of people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| We're not talking about those standing, sitting, I mean, standing or walking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| We're talking about those that are sitting and lying, and that's 10 to 15 folks a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5400)|
| 1:30:05| And we thought we had the numbers worked out for that kind of situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5405)|
| 1:30:09| What happens to the folks at night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| They're not there at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| And this is only from 7 in the morning to 9 at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| I'm looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| I'm looking here and I'm thinking about what I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5418)|
| 1:30:22| The ordinance, as it's in front of you tonight, is from 7 o'clock in the morning to 9 o'clock at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| Remember that the intent of this is economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5426)|
| 1:30:30| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5430)|
| 1:30:31| So the small businesses, everybody's talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| I think everybody understands the issues, so I don't need to go back through that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| But the ordinance is set up to be 7 to 9 at night in particular areas so that we're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5436)|
| 1:30:44| so that it enhances the opportunity to do economic development in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5444)|
| 1:30:48| And we thought we had it pretty well planned and a place for folks to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5448)|
| 1:30:56| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5458)|
| 1:30:59| I'd like to ask Mr. Rawson a question, Rosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5459)|
| 1:31:04| Did I understand you correctly that you would make your parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5464)|
| 1:31:07| which is right at the end of the building, available for these people to sit in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5467)|
| 1:31:13| That's what we are doing, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5473)|
| 1:31:14| So we're really talking about, what, moving people 100 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5474)|
| 1:31:19| Because I drive up and down through there 30 or 40 times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5479)|
| 1:31:23| Excuse me, excuse me, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| You know, 30 or 40 times a week because my office is in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5485)|
| 1:31:29| But, you know, and I do see people, a few, not a whole lot, 10, 12, something like that maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5489)|
| 1:31:35| sitting there sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5495)|
| 1:31:36| Sometimes I don't notice any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| But are we talking about moving those people into your parking lot and letting them sit there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5498)|
| 1:31:44| versus sitting on the sidewalk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| What we're talking about is offering that as an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| And that was a move that CARM made nearly a year and a half ago before this ordinance had ever become known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5509)|
| 1:31:56| It was our attempt to begin to engage people, identifying those people who were on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5516)|
| 1:32:01| who perhaps if offered an alternative to the street might be inclined to come off the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5521)|
| 1:32:07| It was never the intent to make anybody come off the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| nor is it intended now to be any form of a confined setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5530)|
| 1:32:14| It is simply to say that if someone wanted an alternative to being on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5534)|
| 1:32:19| we would be there to offer it, nothing more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| We're probably getting ready to vote on this real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| I just want to make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| So any of these people that are sitting out here on the sidewalk or laying or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5548)|
| 1:32:34| can walk into your parking lot and walk back out any time they want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5554)|
| 1:32:39| That would be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5559)|
| 1:32:40| And sit if they want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| That would be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5562)|
| 1:32:43| As long as they agree to abide by certain rules of decency that we would want enforced in our parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5563)|
| 1:32:50| But for someone to come off the street, to sit down, enjoy a refreshment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5570)|
| 1:32:54| and decide they want to go back off, it's not a confined setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| Much like that's true for the lodging we provide each night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| We're sleeping somewhere between 450 and 500 people every night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5581)|
| 1:33:05| but the only people who sleep there are the people who want to sleep there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| and if they choose not to, they're free to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| The same will be true on the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| This is not a panacea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| It is not a fix-all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5594)|
| 1:33:15| It is simply an option to people on the street that would still be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| even if this ordinance did not come up for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| Well, let me ask you one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| What would be the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| Because I'm not one of those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| I haven't been there and done that, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| What would be the difference in these people sitting in your parking lot versus sitting on the sidewalk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5612)|
| 1:33:38| Well, from our perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5618)|
| 1:33:39| the only difference is they'd be sitting in a place that has restrooms accessible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5619)|
| 1:33:44| maybe has refreshments available to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5624)|
| 1:33:47| and offers a few services that generally are not available on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| And why that became important to us as I looked outside of our windows prior to the I-40 construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5631)|
| 1:33:57| seeing people urinate outside and defecate outside was a regular occurrence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| We wanted to be able to offer something more humane than having to use the bathroom outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5641)|

| 1:34:40| 10A is an appeal by Owen Kochen of the Board of Zoning Appeals' decision to deny the request for a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5680)|
| 1:34:46| to reduce the north side yard setback from 12 feet to 10 feet as per site plan to add a two-story addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5686)|

| 1:35:00| That's the fifth district, and it's in conjunction with Resolution 11M,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5700)|
| 1:35:05| which is a resolution approving the appeal by Mr. Kochen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5705)|
| 1:35:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5709)|

| 1:35:12| I think there are people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5712)|
| 1:35:16| I don't have anybody signed up to speak in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5716)|
| 1:35:24| Is there anybody here to speak in favor of the appeal by Mr. Kochen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5724)|
| 1:35:30| Mr. Kochen, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5732)|
| 1:35:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5733)|
| 1:35:34| Sir, if you could come to the podium, and if you'd like to speak in favor of this, you get to speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5734)|
| 1:35:40| If you'd like to, you have to give us your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| and then you have five minutes to tell why you're in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5743)|
| 1:35:49| Yes, Mr. Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5749)|
| 1:35:50| I understand you're the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| I know you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5754)|
| 1:35:55| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5755)|
| 1:35:56| I need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5757)|
| 1:35:58| I'm looking to speak in less than five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| Always welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5762)|
| 1:36:03| I'm happy to be here this evening, and my problem is a very, very serious problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5763)|
| 1:36:13| My name is Iwan Kochen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| I live to address 5616 Wallwood Road in Knoxville, Tennessee, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5775)|
| 1:36:25| I have a problem with the house that I built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5785)|
| 1:36:34| I'm considering how far I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| and I have from Mr. Tom from fifth floor for department for building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5797)|
| 1:36:48| Everything is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| Just because when I was every time to the meeting, I don't can speak very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5811)|
| 1:36:57| I take my son with me who can explain exactly what is going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5817)|
| 1:37:05| The board agreed to accept to speaking with my son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5825)|
| 1:37:11| It's better, and I have a little letter here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5831)|
| 1:37:15| The reason why I'm not agree with decision to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5835)|
| 1:37:23| I can give this later, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| If it's part of your argument, you probably need to make it then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| because the decision is going to get made now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| But if you want to give it for the record, we can take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| I think Mr. Frost maybe is coming down to get that from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5854)|
| 1:37:50| Mayor, is there somebody that can read that letter into the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| We can maybe do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| Maybe that sounds reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5874)|
| 1:37:58| Mr. Frost, maybe you'll get the story for us and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5878)|
| 1:38:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5885)|
| 1:38:06| I'll pass them around, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| You have the letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5888)|
| 1:38:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5889)|
| 1:38:10| You want to read the letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5890)|
| 1:38:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5893)|
| 1:38:14| I think the board is more better to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5894)|
| 1:38:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| Anything else, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5899)|
| 1:38:20| Rob, anything that you're going to pass that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5903)|
| 1:38:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| I do have two people signed up to speak against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5909)|
| 1:38:30| Could Ms. Mitchell just read the letter for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| Is that possible so that we'd all know at the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5914)|
| 1:38:35| I think if you would like that, that's a fair request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5917)|
| 1:38:42| My name is Ione Koken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| I live at 5616 Walwood Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| I feel bad because I do not communicate verbally with you as I wish because I am limited with the English language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5926)|
| 1:38:54| That is why I decided to communicate in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| I hope you give full attention to this letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| I am unsatisfied because BZA, they took this decision and denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5939)|
| 1:39:04| I understood this point on the date of 18th of June because of support, this decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5944)|
| 1:39:11| the complaint of Lana Hutchison because of the mud that got washed into her yard while I was cleaning my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5951)|
| 1:39:19| I want to answer to BZA because it is insufficient support, no matter how mud there would be, to turn down the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5959)|
| 1:39:29| Though this letter, I, too, aware you and at the same time answer because it is not true that I don't respect the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5969)|
| 1:39:39| and do what I want in the neighborhood as she said on 18th of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5979)|
| 1:39:45| If it were how she said, I wouldn't have contacted her as soon as the mud got washed into her yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5985)|
| 1:39:53| I asked Lana to talk only what she knows because if she talks about my relations with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5993)|
| 1:39:59| this makes it clear to understand that her, she is influenced by my neighbor that is giving me problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=5999)|
| 1:40:06| and she is, too, along with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| I have been responsible about what we say, and that is why she should remember that when I contacted her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6009)|
| 1:40:17| and saw what had happened, I said, I am guilty and responsible for the mud but not for the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6017)|
| 1:40:24| I asked what she wanted me to do to clean it up myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6024)|
| 1:40:27| She said, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| I said, do you want me to hire someone to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6029)|
| 1:40:31| She said, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6031)|
| 1:40:33| I was there with my inspector and told him that what happened is not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6033)|
| 1:40:38| I told my inspector I can't go clean if she said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| This evening I want this BZA to be more patient and give me a chance to talk and say what Lana said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6041)|
| 1:40:48| That is why I ask now that BZA to revise and see if the decision they made on the 18th of June is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6048)|
| 1:40:57| I said no to the decision through another letter, and I say the same thing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6057)|
| 1:41:02| That decision was taken very irresponsibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| There is a solution for Lana to go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6065)|
| 1:41:09| As I said then, to have a legal dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6069)|
| 1:41:12| I repeat, I don't want to force anything, but I ask BZA to revise seriously while there are reasons to deny the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6072)|
| 1:41:19| I just want to say what Lana said when I asked to clean her yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6079)|
| 1:41:23| Thank you, Mr. Kochen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| We have two people signed up to speak against this, first Dan Kidd and then second Lana Hutchison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6087)|
| 1:41:34| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6096)|
| 1:41:37| My name is Dan Kidd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6097)|
| 1:41:38| I live at 5622 Walwood, which is two doors down from Mr. Kochen on the same side of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6098)|
| 1:41:44| And I had passed up before the meeting a petition that we had passed around the neighborhood just in the last couple of days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6104)|
| 1:41:54| stating that opposition to the variance, I think there were some 30 people signed it in opposition to the variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6114)|
| 1:42:06| and I believe 15 households on the same street as Mr. Kochen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6126)|
| 1:42:12| And this is a very short street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| The opposition that we have to the variance, my understanding of the permit and the variance he's requesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6136)|
| 1:42:25| his house is over the setback requirement for a multi-story house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6145)|
| 1:42:31| If it is a one-story house, the footprint of the house would not be in violation of any setback requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6151)|
| 1:42:38| He applied for a permit some years ago, I believe, to add this two-story addition, but he added a three-story addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6158)|
| 1:42:48| None of the houses on this street are more than one story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6168)|
| 1:42:54| Three stories is definitely out of character with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6174)|
| 1:42:59| My opposition to the third story is probably more personal than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6179)|
| 1:43:05| He has picture windows on the third story, and he can see over the house that is between us and into my pool area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6185)|
| 1:43:14| And he has talked about that to my wife, that he can see her when we are swimming in the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6194)|
| 1:43:22| So we are opposed, I'm opposed to a third story with any kind of picture windows looking into my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6202)|
| 1:43:30| But the third story, like I said, it juts up above the rest of his house and is out of character with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6210)|
| 1:43:40| The second story is a little less objectionable because the height of just two stories on the back of his house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6220)|
| 1:43:49| because of the lay of the land, does not appear from the street looking at it to be a two-story house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6229)|
| 1:43:57| It still appears to be a one-story house if he would remove the third story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6237)|
| 1:44:02| And that is why, in the petition, the people who signed it said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| we would not object to a variance allowing him a two-story addition on the back of his house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6246)|
| 1:44:12| but we want the third story taken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6252)|
| 1:44:15| And as I said, there were some 30 people who signed this statement within the last couple of three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6255)|
| 1:44:25| There are some here as well, I think, that wanted to sign it here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6265)|
| 1:44:31| that did not get a chance to sign it over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6271)|
| 1:44:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6274)|
| 1:44:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6275)|
| 1:44:36| Ms. Lana Hutchinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6276)|
| 1:44:41| Mayor, can I just ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6281)|
| 1:44:42| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| Who did the pictures come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| The pictures from, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6286)|
| 1:44:49| From you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6289)|
| 1:44:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6291)|
| 1:44:52| You want to wait and ask him maybe after she speaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6293)|
| 1:44:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6294)|
| 1:44:55| If you'd go ahead and give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6295)|
| 1:44:57| My name is Lana Hutchinson, and I'm the owner of 5519 Scenic Wood Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6297)|
| 1:45:02| which is a house directly behind and kind of to the side of Waltwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6302)|
| 1:45:09| So I'm on the back side, not on the same street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6309)|
| 1:45:12| Never knew anybody that lived on that street until recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6312)|
| 1:45:16| I also had presented some pictures I'd like for you to hand out at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6316)|
| 1:45:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6324)|
| 1:45:26| My understanding of the meeting today is to determine if the variance request denied by the Board of Zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6326)|
| 1:45:32| should be approved today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| As I had stated to the Board of Zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| Mr. Cocaine's addition had an adverse impact on the character of the neighborhood in which his site is located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6336)|
| 1:45:44| and I hope to prove that to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| First, Mr. Cocaine has exhibited disrespect to his neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6346)|
| 1:45:51| and this governing body by his actions of doing as he pleases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6351)|
| 1:45:56| I will only speak of the direct impact he has had on me and my property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6356)|
| 1:46:01| as I know several other neighbors have also been affected by his actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6361)|
| 1:46:05| In regards to my property, I have pictures of how he had rerouted the watershed from his property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6365)|
| 1:46:11| to create a red clay river through my yard and into the crawl space of my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6371)|
| 1:46:16| In addition to leaving about four inches of water and mud standing under my house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6376)|
| 1:46:21| he had also directed the red river to flow into the stormwater drainage system in front of my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6381)|
| 1:46:27| I have copies of the citation he received from these actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6387)|
| 1:46:31| Also, he was advised to make arrangements to have the sediment cleared from all parties affected downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6391)|
| 1:46:38| I met with him and asked him to have his insurance company to contact me or a licensed contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6398)|
| 1:46:46| At that time, he informed me he would clean it up himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| I told him that was not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| I needed to make sure I had someone that was bonded and insured to do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6413)|
| 1:46:58| Secondly, he is asking to construct a two-story addition to his existing one-story resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6418)|
| 1:47:04| At this time, I would encourage you to view the photos I have taken so you can see he has already constructed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6424)|
| 1:47:11| a two-and-a-half-story addition to the back of his house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6431)|
| 1:47:15| Again, he is doing as he pleases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6435)|
| 1:47:18| So today, I strongly speak out in opposition to his variance request due to the disregard and disrespect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6438)|
| 1:47:25| he has shown his neighborhood, the city, and this governing body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6445)|
| 1:47:29| I would also like to know if his variance request is denied again today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6449)|
| 1:47:33| Will he have to take down this structure he has completed to date, or will he be able to continue to do as he pleases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6453)|
| 1:47:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6461)|
| 1:47:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6462)|
| 1:47:43| Those are the only speakers, so we'll move now to comments of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| I actually went out to view this property today, this afternoon, and then I had a long conversation with Angela Halber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6470)|
| 1:47:57| from the Law Department, who I guess sits with BZA and was very familiar with this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6477)|
| 1:48:02| And certainly it's complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6482)|
| 1:48:05| As Ms. Halber explained to me, there was originally a one-story home, a rancher on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6485)|
| 1:48:13| that was within the required setbacks, but it all has to do with stories, as we've just heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6493)|
| 1:48:20| And as Council remembers, we went through this recently with some neighborhood organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6500)|
| 1:48:27| that were concerned about heights, and we got away in our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6507)|
| 1:48:30| Am I right, Ms. Poplin, from measuring in height, but rather we look at stories?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6510)|
| 1:48:34| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| And so when Mr. Kochen added a story, added some living space on top of this ranch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6516)|
| 1:48:45| that's what pushed him into a different category in terms of the setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6525)|
| 1:48:50| which is why he had to come for this variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6530)|
| 1:48:53| Ms. Poplin, in talking to Ms. Halber, my understanding is that when folks went out from the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6533)|
| 1:49:00| they determined or measured this as a two-story house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6540)|
| 1:49:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6543)|
| 1:49:05| Actually, I'll probably have to defer to Mr. Reynolds on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6545)|
| 1:49:10| Mr. Reynolds, what was your –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| Tom, if you'd give us your name and position, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| I'm Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6554)|
| 1:49:15| I'm a builder who's only planning to retrieve for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6555)|
| 1:49:18| Mr. Reynolds, I went out and looked at this property today, and it is confusing because, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6558)|
| 1:49:22| the front of the house looks almost like a Cape Cod or a story and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6562)|
| 1:49:29| The roofline comes all the way down to the top of the first story with dormers across it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6569)|
| 1:49:34| and I thought that a Cape Cod-type look like that would be a story and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6574)|
| 1:49:38| But then there's kind of a crow's nest addition on the back of the house that's higher than the roofline of the Cape Cod part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6578)|
| 1:49:47| for lack of a better word, than the front of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6587)|
| 1:49:50| So given that the front of the house seems to have a story and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6590)|
| 1:49:53| and then there's this other kind of half story above, and, again, we don't measure in height, so it's difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6593)|
| 1:49:59| but it appeared to be a two-story house if you included this crow's nest piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6599)|
| 1:50:05| What was your conclusion when you went out and looked, or your department's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6605)|
| 1:50:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6610)|
| 1:50:11| Can I just give you a little bit of history and then how this developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6611)|
| 1:50:14| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| Mr. Kolkin first pulled a permit in 2001 to add a rear bedroom and playroom to his single-story residential home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6616)|
| 1:50:28| This project went on until it was expired in November of 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6628)|
| 1:50:39| and there were some inspections along the way during that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| Then in 2008, he was issued a new permit to finish this work that was on this permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6644)|
| 1:50:53| At that time, and during the first permit, there was inspections on the footer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6653)|
| 1:51:01| Now, when the building inspector goes back again, the structure had been added to in height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6661)|
| 1:51:11| So at that time, the building inspector informed Mr. Kolkin that because he had increased the height of the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6671)|
| 1:51:19| that he may be in violation of a side yard setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6679)|
| 1:51:24| So at that point, Mr. Kolkin began trying to locate, we needed to locate the side property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6684)|
| 1:51:31| because that was the only violation at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| Now, let me address the issue about height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6694)|
| 1:51:38| In the ordinance, when we look at the front of a structure, the only thing we're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6698)|
| 1:51:43| we're not looking at stories in the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6703)|
| 1:51:45| We're looking at height, and that's an average height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| So it takes into account the elevation at the front building line of where the foundation is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6707)|
| 1:51:54| and then the average height of the hood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6714)|
| 1:51:57| And I explain it very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6717)|
| 1:51:59| We would measure because if we had a gable-type roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6719)|
| 1:52:03| if the pitch of that roof is more than four and a half and twelve, we measure the height, the average height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6723)|
| 1:52:09| In other words, we would go from the eave to the tip of the roof, and it would be half of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6729)|
| 1:52:14| So that's what we mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6734)|
| 1:52:15| We wouldn't go to the tip of the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6735)|
| 1:52:17| So when you're in front of a building and looking at the height of it, and you have a gabled roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6737)|
| 1:52:22| you wouldn't necessarily look at where the crown of the roof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6742)|
| 1:52:26| or the very tip-top part of the building is at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6746)|
| 1:52:29| You would look at down halfway from where the eave is at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6749)|
| 1:52:32| So in my opinion, Mr. Kocken was not in violation of the height at the front street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6752)|
| 1:52:39| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6759)|
| 1:52:40| So I hope that answers that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6760)|
| 1:52:43| And so in determining whether or not a building's height kicks in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6763)|
| 1:52:49| the side yard setback as being 12 feet versus what it was before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6769)|
| 1:52:59| that has to do with the height as measured at the front of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6779)|
| 1:53:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6782)|
| 1:53:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6783)|
| 1:53:04| We're getting really to the issue at hand now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6784)|
| 1:53:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6787)|
| 1:53:08| When we go to look at the side yard setback, then we do look at stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6788)|
| 1:53:16| And he had added stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| That's occupiable living area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| So like in a Cape Cod, the living area could be within the dimensions of the roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6801)|
| 1:53:27| and I think that's what's happened to how Mr. Kocken added to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6807)|
| 1:53:32| At that time when he did that, it came into question to his side yard setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6812)|
| 1:53:37| because that increases if you have a multi-story building, which he added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6817)|
| 1:53:42| So we needed a property line to measure to because it was really close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6822)|
| 1:53:48| We thought it was really close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6828)|
| 1:53:50| So Mr. Kocken hired a surveyor to survey his property, his side property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6830)|
| 1:53:57| And it turns out that, and I'm sure if you read your notes here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6837)|
| 1:54:03| that this had been before BZA on four different occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6843)|
| 1:54:08| Four times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6848)|
| 1:54:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6849)|
| 1:54:10| And there was some dispute about the validity of the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6850)|
| 1:54:15| Mr. Kocken didn't agree with his surveyor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6855)|
| 1:54:18| So it was postponed a number of times to understand whether or not the survey was valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6858)|
| 1:54:28| It was finally determined that the survey was 10.74 feet, I think, or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6868)|
| 1:54:36| but it was less than the 12 feet that was required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6876)|
| 1:54:40| When that was determined, then Mr. Kocken was in violation of the side yard setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6880)|
| 1:54:49| and he asked for relief of that at BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6889)|
| 1:54:53| And BZA, and it's in the notes here where BZA denied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6893)|
| 1:54:59| And he's appealing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6899)|
| 1:55:00| And I hope that explains how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6900)|
| 1:55:03| So, Mr. Ronalds, my understanding is that the final determination was in its as-built state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6903)|
| 1:55:11| the structure is 10.7 feet off the property line and 12 feet is the requirement in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6911)|
| 1:55:20| So he is 1.3 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6920)|
| 1:55:23| His actual need for a variance is 1.3 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6923)|
| 1:55:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6927)|
| 1:55:28| Let me make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| The final survey was 10.4 feet as determined by the surveyor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6930)|
| 1:55:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6937)|
| 1:55:38| So he's 16 to 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6938)|
| 1:55:40| And I don't think Mr. Kocken agrees with that survey either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| Do you, Mr. Kocken?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6942)|
| 1:55:43| I'm sorry about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| But that's what the survey of record has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6945)|
| 1:55:47| Not correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6947)|
| 1:55:48| Let me go back to a couple of other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6948)|
| 1:55:52| The rear of the house where there is the addition that's higher than the roof line that you see from the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6952)|
| 1:55:59| how does that affect the measurement in terms of our building codes and requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6959)|
| 1:56:04| We only determine height from the front yard setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6964)|
| 1:56:06| From the front yard setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6966)|
| 1:56:08| And does it matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6968)|
| 1:56:09| Some of the pictures that were passed around had notations on the back as to whether or not that space was livable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6969)|
| 1:56:17| And so it sounds like this part of the structure that's on the rear of the house doesn't really affect how we measure in terms of our codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6977)|
| 1:56:23| because we measure the height of the house at the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6983)|
| 1:56:27| And so whether the part in the back, as noted on these pictures, was livable space or not is really not germane, I guess, to our decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6987)|
| 1:56:35| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6995)|
| 1:56:36| I think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6996)|
| 1:56:37| And, you know, as I read through the notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| I could tell it was very complex in terms of some of the unfortunate incidents that happened with the neighbors in terms of the mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=6999)|
| 1:56:47| We saw those pictures that were passed around and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7007)|
| 1:56:49| And that's something that's dealt with through our inspections department in terms of how well the construction site is being maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7009)|
| 1:56:58| But that doesn't really affect the decision in terms of setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7018)|
| 1:57:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7022)|
| 1:57:03| That's handled by the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7023)|
| 1:57:05| That's an engineering issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7025)|
| 1:57:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7026)|
| 1:57:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7027)|
| 1:57:08| Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7028)|
| 1:57:09| Oh, I had just seen Mr. Reynolds there, and I had heard this discussion at BCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7029)|
| 1:57:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7037)|
| 1:57:18| And felt that he could be very helpful, and you have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| Thank you, Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7040)|
| 1:57:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7041)|
| 1:57:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7042)|
| 1:57:23| Any other questions from any member of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7045)|
| 1:57:26| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7046)|
| 1:57:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7048)|
| 1:57:29| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7049)|
| 1:57:30| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7050)|
| 1:57:31| Councilman Hulkus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7051)|
| 1:57:32| Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| I apologize if I didn't pick this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| But if this variance were denied, what then, what action will your department take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7056)|
| 1:57:44| and what will the owner have to do to comply with your actions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7064)|
| 1:57:50| Well, Councilman Hulkus, I've asked the same question, where we're going to go with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7070)|
| 1:57:57| I think that we would probably proceed with the legal proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7077)|
| 1:58:03| They asked him to remove that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7083)|
| 1:58:06| Remove?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7086)|
| 1:58:07| Remove the story above to get back to one story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7087)|
| 1:58:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7090)|
| 1:58:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7091)|
| 1:58:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7092)|
| 1:58:13| But that's not been determined yet how we would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7093)|
| 1:58:18| Mr. Kochan, you actually now, by our rules, have the right to get up and give a two-minute response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7098)|
| 1:58:25| So if you would like to do that, our rules provide you to have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7105)|
| 1:58:28| I think I'd like to help my son a little bit, if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7108)|

| 1:58:35| He's 14 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7115)|
| 1:58:36| I'd like to help him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7116)|
| 1:58:37| We'd welcome him to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7117)|
| 1:58:39| I'm not speak very well grammar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7119)|

| 2:01:06| the second time, Mr. Bruce, it's a server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7266)|

| 2:02:18| Who provided these pictures, the ones that went around first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7338)|
| 2:02:22| I think Mr. Kocan did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7342)|
| 2:02:26| The first ones were Mr. Kocan's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7346)|
| 2:02:28| These are your pictures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7348)|
| 2:02:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7349)|
| 2:02:31| I'm a little confused here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7351)|
| 2:02:38| First of all, Mr. Kocan, I don't think you've made your neighbors very happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7358)|
| 2:02:42| I just state that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7362)|
| 2:02:44| You know, the erosion problem, I wish we could communicate a little bit better because I'd like to really get a response from you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7364)|
| 2:02:51| on some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7371)|
| 2:02:54| I'm not one that thinks we ought to allow people to get away with certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7374)|
| 2:02:58| And, again, I want to say this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7378)|
| 2:03:01| I went over to see these appeals today, and when I went over to the first one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7381)|
| 2:03:07| I was told that this one was going to be postponed, which actually it was the severance one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7387)|
| 2:03:14| So I didn't even go see this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7394)|
| 2:03:16| I'm really curious to what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7396)|
| 2:03:19| Now, does he have two or three stories?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7399)|
| 2:03:22| I know one of the gentlemen said that, you know, if he didn't put the third one on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7402)|
| 2:03:28| he wouldn't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7408)|
| 2:03:30| And I really wish I could see this, you know, to know what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7410)|
| 2:03:34| If you have to take the third story down or the second and third story down, you know, what kind of cost is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7414)|
| 2:03:40| I'm sorry, Mr. Kidd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7420)|
| 2:03:41| It's not appropriate for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7421)|
| 2:03:42| Mr. Reynolds can reply to that, but it's probably not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7422)|
| 2:03:44| Mr. Reynolds, I'm just trying to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7424)|
| 2:03:46| I didn't get a chance to see it, and I can't really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7426)|
| 2:03:48| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7428)|
| 2:03:50| Go ahead, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7430)|
| 2:03:53| Did you finish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7435)|
| 2:03:56| What are we dealing with here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7436)|
| 2:03:57| What is that picture there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7437)|
| 2:03:59| And, you know, I don't know if you got a chance to look at these or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| but are we talking about three stories in the back or two stories?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7442)|
| 2:04:07| I'm sorry, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7447)|
| 2:04:08| We have to stay by rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7448)|
| 2:04:10| I haven't seen those pictures, Councilman Budde.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7450)|
| 2:04:12| May I look at them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7452)|
| 2:04:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| Actually, Tom, if you just stay down there at the podium and we'll come to you, it'll be easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7455)|
| 2:04:18| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7458)|
| 2:04:19| I looked at one of these pictures, and it looks like the backyard is just totally washed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7459)|
| 2:04:24| And, you know, weren't they, Steve, supposed to put up fencing and so forth, some type of containment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7464)|
| 2:04:34| We did have an erosion sediment control issue on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7474)|
| 2:04:38| I think the picture that you're referring to is of the downstream neighbor's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7478)|
| 2:04:43| I think she spoke and alluded to that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7483)|
| 2:04:46| There was some muddy water and mud that got off their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7486)|
| 2:04:51| which we inspected and issued a notice of violation on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7491)|
| 2:04:56| One of those pictures has a lawnmower in the basement that's covered up with mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7496)|
| 2:05:05| That's her picture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7505)|
| 2:05:06| Okay, Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7506)|
| 2:05:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7508)|
| 2:05:10| I have been on site and looked at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7510)|
| 2:05:13| and there was a complaint about how many stories the building, Mr. Kocan's house, was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7513)|
| 2:05:18| I don't know how much you remember about this picture here, but this one could explain it very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7518)|
| 2:05:24| Right, I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7524)|
| 2:05:25| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7525)|
| 2:05:26| I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7526)|
| 2:05:27| You remember this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7527)|
| 2:05:28| I remember it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7528)|
| 2:05:29| You remember this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7529)|
| 2:05:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7530)|
| 2:05:31| If you notice where he entered this entrance here, that goes down into his former crawl space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7531)|
| 2:05:36| It only has a ceiling or a headroom clearance of six feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7536)|
| 2:05:42| That was part of the basement that was under the original house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7542)|
| 2:05:47| That's an extension of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7547)|
| 2:05:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7548)|
| 2:05:49| Which also had a low ceiling area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7549)|
| 2:05:51| We would look at that as this part here being a basement because of how much the soil is around that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7551)|
| 2:06:01| There's a good way to look at it if there's more underground than there is exposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7561)|
| 2:06:06| So we did look at this as a basement, which would not count as a story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7566)|
| 2:06:10| And when you start looking at the other part of the house, there would be a story here where the main floor level was to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7570)|
| 2:06:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7580)|
| 2:06:21| And then he added above that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7581)|
| 2:06:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7583)|
| 2:06:24| Another story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7584)|
| 2:06:26| And if I remember correctly, I'm not seeing all of this, he then went into his attic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7586)|
| 2:06:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7594)|
| 2:06:35| And started finishing that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| And then out of that attic on the back side of the gable, I think, if I remember correctly, he put a balcony and a door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7598)|
| 2:06:48| Now, I've told Mr. Kochen the way I would not approve this for a living area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7608)|
| 2:06:56| There's not going to be any way that we can approve that for a living area because it doesn't have adequate headroom height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7616)|
| 2:07:02| But people finish their houses, attic areas, all the time for storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7622)|
| 2:07:07| That's the way we'd look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7627)|
| 2:07:08| But we would not count that as a living area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7628)|
| 2:07:11| There would be no way that he could use that living area or the area in his basement where he did not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7631)|
| 2:07:17| good headroom clearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7637)|
| 2:07:19| So when you look at the back of it, and our ordinance talks about living area being counted as stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7639)|
| 2:07:29| we would not count that as stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7649)|
| 2:07:32| His basement area we wouldn't because he couldn't live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7652)|
| 2:07:35| And his attic area because he couldn't live there either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7655)|
| 2:07:38| But he could use it for storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7658)|
| 2:07:41| Does that explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7661)|
| 2:07:42| That helps me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7662)|
| 2:07:43| Now, the gentleman behind you there was coming to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7663)|
| 2:07:45| I wanted to ask you what your comment was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7665)|
| 2:07:47| And the petition says in here that if you remove the objection if the third-story addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7667)|
| 2:07:55| Whether you call it a storage area, a second-story, a third-story, a 15-story, whatever the top story is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7675)|
| 2:08:01| he's got picture windows facing my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7681)|
| 2:08:05| Tom, is that the area we're talking about now that you were just talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7685)|
| 2:08:10| I haven't seen the pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7690)|
| 2:08:13| Councilman Roddy, you've been over there, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7693)|
| 2:08:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7696)|
| 2:08:17| I was going to say, Councilman Bailey, this home, this structure is truly unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7697)|
| 2:08:22| and the situation is truly unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7702)|
| 2:08:24| And as it is in Councilman, Vice Mayor Becker's district, I'd like to propose that we postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7704)|
| 2:08:31| I believe he's here for the next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7711)|
| 2:08:33| and I realize that's an inconvenience for the citizens on both sides of this issue and for Mr. Reynolds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7713)|
| 2:08:38| who would have to attend again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7718)|
| 2:08:40| Having had the time this afternoon to go out and look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7720)|
| 2:08:44| I think it's very difficult to understand the complexities of this issue without viewing the property in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7724)|
| 2:08:50| So I'd like to propose a postponement of this for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7730)|
| 2:08:54| I would invite all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7734)|
| 2:08:56| Excuse me, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7736)|
| 2:08:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7737)|
| 2:08:58| There's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7738)|
| 2:08:59| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7739)|
| 2:09:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7740)|
| 2:09:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7741)|
| 2:09:02| Now discussion from Council on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7742)|
| 2:09:03| I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7743)|
| 2:09:04| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7744)|
| 2:09:05| We were all invited to my house in the backyard to see, I think from my point of view, what he has built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7745)|
| 2:09:12| and why it's objectionable to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7752)|
| 2:09:15| Well, I'll tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7755)|
| 2:09:16| I'd be happy to meet with you out there and you all as well and to go through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7756)|
| 2:09:22| and see if we can't figure out how to remedy this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7762)|
| 2:09:27| And I'll come see you too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7767)|
| 2:09:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7769)|
| 2:09:30| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7770)|
| 2:09:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7771)|
| 2:09:32| I understand that some people who are here tonight that care about this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7772)|
| 2:09:36| might not be able to be here at the next meeting in two weeks' time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7776)|
| 2:09:42| Let me just respectfully ask those who are first supportive of Mr. Kokoen's appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7782)|
| 2:09:49| in case they can't be here in two weeks' time, to please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7789)|
| 2:09:52| And then I'll ask likewise for those who are in opposition to his appeal to please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7792)|
| 2:09:59| So council can see if you're not able to come back in two weeks, assuming the postponement passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7799)|
| 2:10:04| we know how folks feel on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7804)|
| 2:10:07| So those supportive of Mr. Kokoen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7807)|
| 2:10:12| Kokoen, I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7812)|
| 2:10:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7815)|
| 2:10:16| Those opposed to his appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7816)|
| 2:10:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7823)|
| 2:10:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7824)|
| 2:10:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7825)|
| 2:10:26| Ms. Pilow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7826)|
| 2:10:27| I would like to make a comment because I did attend the BZA meeting when this was discussed at length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7827)|
| 2:10:35| And I personally don't feel I need a postponement, but I'll try to respect what everyone else feels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7835)|
| 2:10:42| I would like to comment just to your point, Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7842)|
| 2:10:46| I believe there were about 30 people in attendance at the BZA meeting in opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7846)|
| 2:10:55| So I think that's probably reflected in the signatures that you see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7855)|
| 2:11:01| And so I felt it only fair to those people who had come out and spent an afternoon missing work to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7861)|
| 2:11:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7872)|
| 2:11:13| The motion on the floor right now is to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7873)|
| 2:11:16| So seeing no lights, we're going to vote on the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7876)|
| 2:11:18| All those in favor, postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7878)|
| 2:11:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7880)|
| 2:11:22| I better do a roll call real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7882)|
| 2:11:23| Sorry, I couldn't hear all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7883)|
| 2:11:25| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7885)|
| 2:11:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7886)|
| 2:11:27| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7887)|
| 2:11:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7888)|
| 2:11:29| Councilman Pilow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7889)|
| 2:11:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7890)|
| 2:11:31| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7891)|
| 2:11:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7892)|
| 2:11:33| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7893)|
| 2:11:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7894)|
| 2:11:35| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7895)|
| 2:11:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7896)|
| 2:11:37| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7897)|
| 2:11:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7898)|
| 2:11:39| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7899)|
| 2:11:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| It passes five to three to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7902)|
| 2:11:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7904)|
| 2:11:45| The motion was passed to postpone it for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7905)|
| 2:11:50| So this matter will be discussed again two weeks from now, and that will give some councilmembers a chance to check it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7910)|
| 2:11:57| and then Councilman Becker, whose district it is, will have the chance to be here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7917)|
| 2:12:01| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7921)|
| 2:12:02| Also, if you have pictures that were passed out, those all need to come back to Ms. Mitchell for our records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7922)|
| 2:12:07| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7927)|
| 2:12:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7928)|
| 2:12:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7929)|
| 2:12:10| 10C is an appeal by Robert A. Due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7930)|
| 2:12:13| The Board of Zoning Appeals' decision to deny the request for variance to increase the maximum accessory building height from 15 feet to 34 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7933)|
| 2:12:20| as per site plan to construct a detached two-story garage in an R1 low-density residential district property located at 6719 Sherwood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7940)|
| 2:12:29| That's in the second district, and it's in conjunction with 11-0, a resolution approving the appeal by Robert A. Due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7949)|
| 2:12:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7957)|
| 2:12:38| I think you'd probably like to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7958)|
| 2:12:39| I think that Mr. Due has representation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7959)|
| 2:12:44| My name is Lewis Howard, 4820 Old Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7964)|
| 2:12:48| I'm here on behalf of Mr. Due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7968)|
| 2:12:50| I know it's a late hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7970)|
| 2:12:52| I'll be happy to answer any questions or make a short presentation as far as the timeline is concerned with this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7972)|
| 2:12:59| This involves an appeal for the height, a variance of the height restriction on an accessory building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7979)|
| 2:13:05| a two-car garage that was constructed in connection with the residence that Mr. Due constructed in the Westmoreland subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7985)|
| 2:13:12| The house was completed in 2007, put on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7992)|
| 2:13:18| A buyer came along, and because of the topography of the property, there's not a basement in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=7998)|
| 2:13:24| The buyer wanted some additional storage, and as part of the purchase agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8004)|
| 2:13:28| asked that a two-story garage be built on the right side of the property that essentially mirrored one that was already existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8008)|
| 2:13:36| but was an attached garage on the left side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8016)|
| 2:13:40| Mr. Due had not completed, finally completed construction of the house, and it had not gone through its final inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8020)|
| 2:13:47| and he assumed that he could construct the garage under the existing permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8027)|
| 2:13:52| Went ahead and did so and completed the structure in March of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8032)|
| 2:13:57| The house was then purchased by the current owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8037)|
| 2:14:02| The current owner moved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8042)|
| 2:14:04| There were some final items done, and during a final inspection in the latter part of 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8044)|
| 2:14:12| it was determined that there should have been a building permit issued for the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8052)|
| 2:14:18| The structure did have electrical, plumbing, footer, and framing inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8058)|
| 2:14:25| It does exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8065)|
| 2:14:27| It has been in existence and utilization by the homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8067)|
| 2:14:32| To our knowledge, there have not been any objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8072)|

| 2:26:07| Before you start my five minutes, nice to see you back, Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8767)|
| 2:26:11| I didn't miss nothing this year I've been gone because this council is still filibustering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8771)|
| 2:26:16| and I knew they were going to approve that ordinance on the homeless anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8776)|
| 2:26:20| but y'all sit there and take an hour and a half and have these people thinking y'all really going to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8780)|
| 2:26:25| for them when you're really not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| I'm waiting to see, Chief, when one of your officers take taxpayers' money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8787)|
| 2:26:31| and go down there and arrest one of them guys who's in a wheelchair on Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8791)|
| 2:26:35| because he ain't got nowhere to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8795)|
| 2:26:37| I can't wait to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8797)|
| 2:26:39| I hope I have my camcorder down through there at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8799)|
| 2:26:42| Man, y'all know how to really mess the taxpayers over in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8802)|
| 2:26:45| That's one reason I quit coming up here because y'all was a joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8805)|
| 2:26:48| Mr. Mayor, hope you do well as governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8808)|
| 2:26:51| Told you you were going to run anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8811)|
| 2:26:52| You need to pay me for that, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8812)|
| 2:26:54| That was like intuition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8814)|
| 2:26:56| But anyway, back to you, Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8816)|
| 2:27:00| That guy you got running for city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8820)|
| 2:27:02| As a matter of fact, I can speak on him because I'm in your district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8822)|
| 2:27:06| and that guy no bit more need to be no doggone city councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8826)|
| 2:27:10| If anybody need to be an Indian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8830)|
| 2:27:12| I haven't seen him do nothing in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8832)|
| 2:27:15| I haven't even heard of this guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8835)|
| 2:27:17| But I know one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8837)|
| 2:27:18| Hold up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8838)|
| 2:27:19| Let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8839)|
| 2:27:20| But one thing, I know he's an architect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8840)|
| 2:27:22| but if y'all want professional people on this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8842)|
| 2:27:24| that's why the council ain't worth two cents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8844)|
| 2:27:26| because there's no ordinary people on that council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8846)|
| 2:27:30| because y'all don't deal with ordinary issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8850)|
| 2:27:33| I hope you're all familiar, Ms. Roddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8853)|
| 2:27:36| but y'all don't deal with ordinary people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8856)|
| 2:27:39| When they ask how many of y'all are going to go down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8859)|
| 2:27:41| and walk on a Broadway and deal with those folk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8861)|
| 2:27:44| then not one of y'all raise your hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8864)|
| 2:27:47| because that's beneath y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8867)|
| 2:27:48| But y'all good at making rules and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8868)|
| 2:27:51| but y'all don't deal with everyday folk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8871)|
| 2:27:52| That's beneath y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8872)|
| 2:27:54| Hey, look here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8874)|
| 2:27:55| Half of y'all brain dead anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8875)|
| 2:27:58| I'm back, and I'm going to speak my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8878)|
| 2:28:00| until the mayor leaves to run for office next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8880)|
| 2:28:03| I don't even know if he should be the new governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8883)|
| 2:28:06| I debated him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8886)|
| 2:28:08| I said, man, I wonder what the mayor has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8888)|
| 2:28:11| The only thing I can remember you really doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8891)|
| 2:28:13| that's going to have an impact is the South National Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8893)|
| 2:28:16| and I always told you that belonged to Joe Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8896)|
| 2:28:19| I haven't seen nothing you've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8899)|
| 2:28:20| and you're about to run for governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090714?start=8900)|
