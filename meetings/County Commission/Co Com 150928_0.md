| 0:03:03| Myself and a minor, we sat at the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=183)|
| 0:03:05| The minor purchased, actually paid for, a Miller Lite bottle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=185)|
| 0:03:10| No ID was checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=190)|

| 0:03:16| Ms. Armstrong, you heard the allegations made from the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| Do you have the option to admit or deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| Admit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| You have an opportunity now to testify before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=206)|
| 0:03:28| Anything on your behalf that you would like them to hear that may mitigate the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=208)|
| 0:03:34| or whatever you would like to say on your behalf at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| I've been there 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| It's the first time it's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| She was new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| I do everything I can to avoid it, but she made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=223)|
| 0:03:51| Mr. Chairman, you heard the testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| Before us we have the offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| Do I hear a motion for this action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=242)|
| 0:04:10| This being the first offense, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| I'll make a motion for a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension, our choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=255)|
| 0:04:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=261)|
| 0:04:23| Is there further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| We have a motion before us for a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| Miss Armstrong, you have an option to pay a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=280)|
| 0:04:50| That's your choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| The choice is tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| Which would you prefer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| I'll pay the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=295)|

| 0:05:03| Miss Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| Miss MPC, lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| Do you have enough for the defendants in this case or just the new . . . ?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=308)|
| 0:05:21| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| I didn't hear what she said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| She said she don't have enough . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| I would suggest that you get a hold of the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| They have a package that we pass out to the new applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| And each of you new applicants, when you come up today, please see her before you leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| which could keep you from coming back up for a case like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| But she can get you one if you'll contact the Metropolitan Drug Commission, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=348)|

| 0:05:54| Willey's Bar & Grill, Incorporated, owner, first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| It's Willey's Bar & Grill here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| It's Chris Malone, 12400 Ambersett Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| What was your name again, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| Chris Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| Chris Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=378)|
| 0:06:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| You saw the procedure before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| The officer will present their allegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| You'll have an opportunity to refute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| Officer, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| My name is Cassie Long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| I'm with the Alcoholic Beverage Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| On August 14th, we conducted a minor compliance check at Willey's Bar & Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| Our minor was served a Miller Lite draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| No ID was checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| However, in this case, unlike the one before, the owner decided to take an identification class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=400)|
| 0:06:46| and we actually went out to his location and taught all of his employees an identification class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| So, no further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=412)|
| 0:06:59| You've heard the allegations from the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| You have the opportunity to affirm or deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| Affirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| This is your opportunity to testify and provide any information you'd like for this board to consider on your behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=427)|
| 0:07:14| Just as Cassie said, this was a situation where we were real busy on a night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| and normally we try to be very diligent about having our servers and bartenders ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| On this particular occasion, this server did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| And in response to that, we took the appropriate action with her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| but we also tried to follow up to make sure that it doesn't happen again by doing the class with ABC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=452)|
| 0:07:38| have them come out and kind of show our remaining employees the right way to do things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| the right way to check and try to make sure in the future we don't have this happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| So that's why we're going to try to work at it as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| Can I question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| You've got a motion first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=476)|
| 0:07:57| I need a motion first, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=477)|
| 0:08:03| I move for a $1,000 fine or suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| Motion is properly before us in seconded discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| Sir, I commend you for taking some action after the fact, but before the fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=498)|
| 0:08:26| your servers have not had the server training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| They didn't have cards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| Oh, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| They all have server cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| That wasn't really the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| It's more of just a refresher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| We're finishing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| We've done six seasons now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| We've never had an issue before, and usually we're pretty diligent about staying on top of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| But obviously this was a time that we got busy, and obviously she got lazy or careless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=525)|
| 0:08:52| So we just wanted to kind of do it as a refresher for the remainder of our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| to try to remind them of the importance of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=536)|

| 0:09:03| How long has she been with you, the server, at the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| She's actually been with us for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| So she was properly carded and everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| She had her ABC everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=552)|

| 0:09:26| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| Mr. Law Director, would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| You have the option of a $1,000 fine or 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| What is your pleasure on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| I will take the 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=578)|

| 0:09:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| You'll have to turn your beer license in to Captain Mays for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=588)|
| 0:09:55| Or you can leave it at the clerk's office, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| You'll either bring it to them or you can bring it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| Effective immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| Deferred application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| San Gabriel Incorporated, Don Jose's Mexican Grill, 7505 Tazewell Pike, on premises, District 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=606)|
| 0:10:14| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| I make a motion that this particular application be deferred to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=624)|
| 0:10:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| Unless he shows up in the next two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| This was a deferment off of the lack of residency, legal residency on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=639)|
| 0:10:48| But I'll second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| And also part of this will be if they still retain their liquor by the drink license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=651)|
| 0:11:03| So this may be deferred again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| Motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| Captain Mays, were you going to make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| This is a place that's up the four-way at Harbison Crossroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=681)|
| 0:11:27| They applied several months ago and we got them in an alcohol sting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=687)|
| 0:11:33| And I was up there two weeks ago and expressed that they needed to show up down here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=693)|
| 0:11:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| Is this the San Gabriel's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| Yes, this is San Gabriel's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| It's Don Jose's Mexican Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| It's at the corner of Emory and Tazewell, Harbison's Crossroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| That's what we just voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| Application, Wesley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| Charlie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| He had his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| Question to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| So in terms of for this deferment, if we're not going to hold the license, could we during the assignment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=735)|
| 0:12:24| I mean, he's basically getting a free month out of us until we rule on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=744)|
| 0:12:31| So is there anything we can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| No, he doesn't have a license right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| He's not getting anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| He's deferring the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| Application, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| Commissioner Bushler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| My question is on this right here, he has been notified that he should be here and not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=764)|
| 0:12:51| and he's come up before us once before, and we have a situation here of the legality of the ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=771)|
| 0:12:58| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| Is there any other thing that we can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| I mean, we can keep deferring this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| How many times can we defer this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| Since the issue is between this business establishment and the state about their status as a, I'll say, liquor by the drink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=788)|
| 0:13:22| until that's settled, I do not think we should entertain their application for a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=802)|
| 0:13:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=809)|

| 0:19:26| We call it booms day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| Too many of the group supporters were unable to make it to the meeting today because of work, moving, being out of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1169)|
| 0:19:35| youth football, and other school commitments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| Hopefully some of you began to receive phone calls on this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| According to many, like Forbes magazine, The Economist magazine, livability.com, and careerbliss.com,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1182)|
| 0:19:50| striving communities have five things in common, stability, access to health care, a good educational system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1190)|
| 0:19:58| infrastructure, great arts, culture, and environments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| Today I just want to talk to you on the topic of arts, culture, and environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| How does one measure the value of booms day directly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| I believe that the only way to measure the success of booms day is by attendance numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| After all, it is a fireworks display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1216)|

| 0:20:37| This is the biggest single day event in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| with the largest fireworks show in the southeast United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1242)|

| 0:20:50| and National Geographic has filmed it for a special TV program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| You see, for 28 years, East Tennesseans have gathered downtown in Knoxville the Sunday before Labor Day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| to celebrate and enjoy a time-honored tradition by watching one of the country's largest fireworks shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1261)|
| 0:21:09| For many of us, this is an opportunity we have in our community to enjoy a free event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1269)|
| 0:21:15| to celebrate the end of summer and the beginning of big orange football.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| If you do any research on Knoxville, Tennessee, it's not hard to find the word booms day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1279)|
| 0:21:25| It's part of our community character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| It's unique to Knox County and Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| It's our own holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| In 2013, Knoxville was listed by Forbes as a top 50 place for business and careers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1292)|
| 0:21:39| CareerBliss.com listed Knoxville number two on the happiest city to work in right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| and Livability.com indicated the city as the top ten place to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| On top of that, the city was named one of the three cities in the country to have recovered best from the recession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| and in the top ten for economic growth potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| Some of you may be wondering why I mention these lists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| All of them understand what it takes to have a striving community like stability, good health care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| good education system, infrastructure, great arts, culture, and environments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| Where else would you find festivals like Dogwoods Arts Festival, Big Ears Festival, and, of course, Boom Day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1333)|
| 0:22:21| It's all uniquely Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| Now, I understand Visit Knoxville has a mission, and they're listed as a nonprofit organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1343)|
| 0:22:29| I also understand they're mostly tax-dollar funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| I believe Visit Knoxville should continue Booms Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| and that they work closely with Knox County and City to make sure this time-honored holiday continues for 2016 and for years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1357)|
| 0:22:47| Simply put, Booms Day does not need to end because of the stated challenges that Visit Knoxville has faced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1367)|
| 0:22:54| in the last few years promoting the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| I am hoping tonight that Visit Knoxville, Knox County, and the City of Knoxville can start a new conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1378)|
| 0:23:05| to develop a strategy to capitalize on the area's favorite holiday we call Booms Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1385)|
| 0:23:11| an event enjoyed by thousands on the Tennessee River in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| Is there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| I will not be able to stay for discussions at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| I have a class at UT tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| Seeing no questions, thank you, Mr. Lones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1407)|

| 0:23:45| That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| This evening's devotion will be led by Commissioner Mike Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1429)|
| 0:23:56| Would you bow with me, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1436)|

| 0:24:27| particularly those that are serving in harm's way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| We ask for your protection for them, Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| Ask you to go with us through this week and forgive us of our sins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| These things we ask in Christ's name. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1475)|

| 0:24:43| If you would please stand and face the flag and give the proper salute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1483)|

| 0:27:27| I think it would still be appropriate that we have a discussion this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| because we may need to formulate what we are thinking our questions might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| Sure, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1656)|
| 0:27:43| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| I'd like to add a discussion item concerning information we received from the Sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1666)|
| 0:27:53| and the overcrowding at the Knox County Detention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1673)|
| 0:28:00| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| We have two other discussion items that need to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1683)|
| 0:28:08| One relates to the Fire Prevention Committee, which was established by appointment of the chair a few months back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1688)|
| 0:28:18| It's approaching a sunset, and if we are to go forward further with that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| it's going to have to be a committee formed by resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| What I would like to have is the three commissioners that were a party to the Fire Prevention Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1709)|
| 0:28:38| have a sunshine meeting between now and the next work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| to sort of capture the sentiment of the meetings that we attended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1722)|
| 0:28:50| and present that as a discussion item at the next commission meeting if there be no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1730)|
| 0:28:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| You were on that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Charlie Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1743)|

| 0:29:05| Commissioner Bussler, Commissioner Thomas, and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| So we will get together and sunshine a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| and come up with some notes on the Fire Prevention Committee findings of the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1752)|
| 0:29:19| And also, a separate discussion item, out of the Audit Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1759)|
| 0:29:26| the last reappointment of a citizen member to the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1766)|
| 0:29:34| brought some discussion about how that takes place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| and the Audit Committee felt like we needed a change, an update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| and how that would take place in light of no recommendation from the local accrediting organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1783)|
| 0:29:54| I'd like to add that as a discussion item at the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| Are there any other additions, withdrawals, or deferrals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1799)|
| 0:30:05| Any other discussion items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Before we move forward on Resolution 101, the honorary resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| we need to make sure that there's nobody here from Childhood Cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| Is anybody here from American Children's Cancer Society?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| We can go ahead and read that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| Or don't have to read it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| I'll make a motion that we add what needs to be added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| and take off what needs to be taken off and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=1832)|

| 0:48:19| and there again the money's already been spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| Let's focus on the one that we've got before us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| Why can't we do both of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| We get through it real fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| We've got to have two separate motions to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| I just brought that up as a, you know, I'm not against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| I just wonder why we were doing it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| We need a motion here before we continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| I asked the same question of the law director last Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=2933)|
| 0:48:58| and paraphrasing him, when it's grant money involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=2938)|
| 0:49:06| and no expenditure from Knox County money, they can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=2946)|
| 0:49:14| I don't like hearing about it after the fact either, which I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| if these things are planned far enough ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| there's no reason it couldn't have been on last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| Well, it should have been two months before now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| But according to the law director, it is legal to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| as long as there's no county money expenditure to go along with it, if it's grant money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=2971)|
| 0:49:38| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| I guess I'm trying to understand what our process is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| and is going to be in terms of workshop versus commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=2989)|
| 0:49:56| I know when we set up this, instead of having intergovernment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| and I forgot the other committee, finance committee meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| we came up with the concept of a workshop where we bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3005)|
| 0:50:11| and we've informed the schools, we will ask you questions at the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| which Commissioner Brown did this month or last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3016)|
| 0:50:20| But for us to be discussing this, and I know there's a little disagreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3020)|
| 0:50:27| on what the consent order says, doesn't say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| but I think we all tend to agree that it is financial in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| And so for us to be entertaining this motion and it not be on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3037)|
| 0:50:45| I mean, as I read it, I thought pretty strongly that it said financial items go on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3045)|
| 0:50:59| And I guess I'll probably need to understand what consent means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| to discuss it at a commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| I think the school board agreed to answer questions at workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3066)|
| 0:51:11| and again, that was the point of a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| The workshop should go longer because that's where we dig into issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| and I think these things should be asked at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| But for us to kind of consistently pull these things off consent in full commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3079)|
| 0:51:25| I disagree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| I don't think that's our proper form and our agreed-upon form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3088)|
| 0:51:36| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| I've been studying the rules that we do on commission here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3100)|
| 0:51:46| and any item, from what I understand, can be pulled off and talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3106)|
| 0:51:53| even after the motion has been voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3113)|
| 0:51:59| and even discussed again at any time before our adjournment on that session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3119)|
| 0:52:10| And I think that's in our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| And I want to ask the law director to see if I'm paraphrasing this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3132)|
| 0:52:23| We have two or three things going on on this very issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| Mr. Bussler is correct on all general items that are before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| Yes, you can pull any of your items off at will any time, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3151)|
| 0:52:39| There are two other issues, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| This is a school board issue that is already appropriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| It's been voted on by this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| It is appropriated by the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| The school board has passed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| Under the consent agreement, it is by consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| because there are no matching funds on these two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| which the proper situation at this time would be you deal with it in the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3180)|
| 0:53:06| and then it comes here on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| Only these two because they do not have matching funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| However, if they had matching funds, they could be pulled off for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3194)|
| 0:53:20| That is the judicial consent agreement that we agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3200)|
| 0:53:25| So we have a court order that's a little in conflict with your rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| and the res judicata of the court would supersede your rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| So these two items are on consent even though they were pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| It's a pro forma as far as this board is concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| because this is in the jurisdiction of the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| because there are no matching funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| The question was a proper question, probably should have been asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| Anyway, I'm not going to get into that, but that's where we find ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| Commissioner Bussler, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| So, I'm sorry, as a point of order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| I think we're in conflict by continuing to discuss these items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| and we need to pass them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| But by what I just heard from the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| I think we're out of order at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| Commissioner McKenzie, up to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| I believe that Commissioner Bussler had a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| about approving something that was past date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| and he was not questioning what this item was going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3266)|
| 0:54:33| Just as you have brought before us right now the fact of how we discuss things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3273)|
| 0:54:40| Commissioner Bussler was asking that same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| Do you have another question, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| But I think this should have been on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| and I think us discussing a consent item at this point is out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| And we're discussing process right at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| Commissioner Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| Commissioner Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| Commissioner Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| Thanks, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| The law director did an excellent job of explaining what I had intended to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3306)|
| 0:55:13| a much better job than I would have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| But also when we were talking about before what Sam was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| about when we were going to pull school issues off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| and discuss them at the work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| it also had something to do with common courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| When the superintendent was here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| and also when we were able to have the chairman of the school board here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3332)|
| 0:55:38| it was easier and more considerate to do all of that at one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3338)|
| 0:55:44| rather than pull things off at work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| and then pull other things off at commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| So I just wanted to remind everybody that that was part of our reasoning as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3351)|
| 0:55:56| as to when these were appropriate to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3356)|
| 0:56:00| And several people had made a statement to that effect at that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3360)|
| 0:56:05| that that was a matter also just of basic common courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3365)|
| 0:56:11| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| I think if I understand it correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| maybe we shouldn't have pulled these off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| We should have had a discussion item about the method| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| by which we get these things from the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| Fair statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| Fair statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| Thank you, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| His light was on behind the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| I saw it before I saw yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| But I guess to get back to answer Commissioner Bussler's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| if an item is passed by the school board and requires no matching grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3402)|
| 0:56:47| I believe it's effective as soon as the school board passes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| I'm not ready to bury this dog yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| This body has the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| If there should something come up between workshop and commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| that would affect it in any way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| this body has the right to pull that and rediscuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3432)|
| 0:57:19| That's not the case in this, but he's right in one way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| but maybe Sam's right in the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| And that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| We are talking about process, not this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| Commissioner Bussler, you have the last word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3454)|
| 0:57:35| That's all I was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| I'm not questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| I'm not voting against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3457)|
| 0:57:38| I'm just asking because I've had some people ask me between the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| session and this session why there was a date on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| and I just thought it would bring up for discussion before we went on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| and passed it and went over it to where it would be on public record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| that this is the way we do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| We properly have a motion before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| Properly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3477)|
| 0:57:58| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3480)|
| 0:58:01| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3482)|

| 1:00:37| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| It's a $25,000 funding of the air show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| It's going to be the equivalency to about two UT home football| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3644)|
| 1:00:49| games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| It'll be ones that we win, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| So when people leave, they'll be excited and want to spend a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| little money, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| And two, it really will showcase the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| I mean, what better location than the air base overlooking the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3659)|
| 1:01:05| mountains?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| It'll just be a wonderful event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| And since the price is right for the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| I think it's just a great opportunity for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3677)|
| 1:01:18| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| You know, Mayor, I applaud the whole organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| the folks that got behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| I'm extremely, extremely excited about this air show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| I think it puts us kind of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| back on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| I guess there was a dogwood air show a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| and then 9-11 happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| But these type events are things that the county should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| getting behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3701)|

| 1:01:48| My only question was, Mayor, is there any indication yet from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| city as far as what they plan to do to help out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3712)|
| 1:01:58| I think financially they've agreed to an equal amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3718)|
| 1:02:03| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| I think they've agreed to $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3725)|
| 1:02:11| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| Mayor, why don't you throw some love Richard's way for all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| hard work he's put into this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| Do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3739)|
| 1:02:20| Throw some love Richard's way for all the hard work he's put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| Oh, well, it wouldn't have happened if Colonel Julian hadn't gotten involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3742)|
| 1:02:30| It would not have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| I mean, the Blue Angels, they're a very hard group to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| So it's totally he gets all the credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3755)|
| 1:02:42| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3762)|

| 1:03:10| Give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| Rick Staples, 926 Wilder Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| I'm going to go ahead and go up so I can get out of the body's way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3794)|
| 1:03:18| The mayor was reminding me of UT football, so I got depressed all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3798)|
| 1:03:24| I don't know why I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| There's been a cloud in my community for the past several weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| A lot of young people taking each other's lives, losing their lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| and it's been a very heavy burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| That's why I want to speak to tradition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| There's a lot of things that can be said that can make a community divisive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| that can make a city divisive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| But one unique tradition that we have here in Knoxville, in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| that people come back home for, that is a prelude to University of Tennessee football,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| is Booms Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| I think Booms Day is a unique tradition that brings everyone together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3838)|
| 1:04:02| brings families together, and we all have a good time as a great community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3842)|
| 1:04:09| great city, great county, that we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| It saddens me to think that we would lose our tradition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| because tradition is what ties us together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| You pass that along to your children for them to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3859)|
| 1:04:24| So in being brief, I'm asking this great body, if you would consider supporting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3864)|
| 1:04:30| keeping Booms Day alive, keeping that tradition that is healthy for our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3870)|
| 1:04:36| that is safe, and brings us all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| Thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| Thank you, Mr. Staples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| That's the only person signed up for public forum at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| Is there other people wishing to address public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| If not, Madam Clerk, other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| Spread of record of the Knox County Ethics Committee's reappointment of May Kilbrew Mosley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3895)|

| 1:05:12| and expiring October 31, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3912)|

| 1:05:21| to the Knox County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3921)|
| 1:05:26| Which brings us to discussion items of our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3926)|
| 1:05:31| the first discussion item being the regarding Booms Day listed by Commissioner Oyenbee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3931)|
| 1:05:44| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3944)|
| 1:05:47| I listed this as a discussion item because I got several calls over the last month and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3947)|
| 1:05:54| about Booms Day being canceled and their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3954)|
| 1:06:00| So I listed it so that people that wanted to come and say something, that they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3960)|
| 1:06:08| Through the conversations over the last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| and I actually went to the last Booms Day, and I hope it's not the last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3970)|
| 1:06:15| and talked to many people that come from Illinois.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3975)|
| 1:06:21| There was somebody that came as far as Massachusetts down here for Booms Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3981)|
| 1:06:25| You had Missouri. You had Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3985)|
| 1:06:31| People were coming from all over, Florida, coming up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3991)|
| 1:06:34| So people were coming up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| Yeah, a lot of them were coming in their own RVs and parking either in RV parks or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=3996)|
| 1:06:43| just so they can enjoy this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| It has become a tradition for Knox County and for this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4006)|
| 1:06:51| and I think it is a tradition that's worth carrying on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4011)|
| 1:06:56| And I would plead with the county and the city to let's work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4016)|
| 1:07:03| Let's figure out a way that we can continue this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| As Mr. Staples said and Mr. Lomas said as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| this is something that brings our communities together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| and people come back that moved away to other parts of the country just for Booms Day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| and enjoy football for that weekend and enjoy Booms Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4038)|
| 1:07:23| It does attract a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| It does, I believe, we get a lot of sales tax off of that Booms Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4045)|
| 1:07:31| We're talking anywhere from 150,000 to 400,000 different estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4051)|
| 1:07:37| I think we need to find a way to try to keep it going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| If it means maybe scaling it back a little bit or whatever, maybe it's just got too big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4061)|
| 1:07:47| But I think it's something worth keeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| So I would ask that the two mayors get together and get with a visit in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4070)|
| 1:07:58| and see if we can't find a way to keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4078)|
| 1:08:01| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| I agree with Commissioner Orme, and I'm sure all of you have gotten calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4084)|
| 1:08:08| I'd like to suggest that we've got a year to work on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| that you appoint a couple of members of commission to work with a couple of members of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4091)|
| 1:08:19| and the two mayors to investigate, see if there's anything we can do to put this back together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4099)|
| 1:08:27| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| Yeah, I'm kind of, you know, people have talked about Booms Day and talked about missing Booms Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4109)|
| 1:08:37| Of course, I have a little bit of a different perspective on, you know, the history of Booms Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| The history of Booms Day was a private event held in coalition with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| through the private grants and sponsorships and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4127)|
| 1:08:52| And then once those grants started or sponsorships started drying up, Visit Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| what was then Sports and Tourism Corporation, I believe, took on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4136)|
| 1:09:04| And what it takes is, you know, Commissioner Brown's desire to have everybody get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4144)|
| 1:09:09| You don't have a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| Last year's Booms Day was being planned in 14 and 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4151)|
| 1:09:15| And so 15 is planned in 14 and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4155)|
| 1:09:19| And so it takes roughly a staff member at Visit Knoxville four to five months of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4159)|
| 1:09:26| And that doesn't count the team coming in together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| The mission of Visit Knoxville is to put heads in beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| And they surveyed hotel motels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| They surveyed downtown restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| And they talked to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| And they said, do you have specific traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| Most of that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| Do you have specific traffic for Booms Day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| Do you have ñ because they want to track it because of their advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4187)|
| 1:09:50| They want to put their advertising dollars in the right places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| So they tracked why people come to their hotel for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| And Booms Day had zero effect on heads in beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| and limited effect on heads in beds in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| Visit Knoxville is tasked with promoting and sustaining tourism events in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4203)|
| 1:10:12| And this did not meet the mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| We compared it to Riverbend in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| Well, Riverbend is a three-day event that holds as a ticketed event, three-day event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4217)|
| 1:10:24| It's huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| It draws in hundreds of thousands of people every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| But those people stay in hotels downtown in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| They stay around Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| Booms Day does not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4234)|
| 1:10:35| Booms Day is a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| It's a wonderful event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| I've been on the footprint of that thing 15 years or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| And there's nothing down there until the last hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| There's limited participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| And there's just as many people sitting on the side of the road watching it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| somewhere else than there is on the footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| The county has never put a dollar in Booms Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4256)|
| 1:11:00| The county commission has never been a part of Booms Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4260)|
| 1:11:04| And so it makes me wonder why that we're trying to revive something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4264)|
| 1:11:09| we've never been a part of as a county commission, as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| The city donates in-kind services of almost $60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| Every policeman, fireman, traffic engineering, service department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| facilities guy down there is on overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| And so all of that is paid for by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4284)|
| 1:11:28| And so that's their in-kind gift to visit Knoxville for Booms Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4288)|
| 1:11:33| Foothills Fall Festival, paid event, gone away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4293)|
| 1:11:39| Oak Ridge's Secret City event, scaled back, almost dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| So these things are disappearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| I'll go way back into the 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| Saturday night on the town was a closed gay street with free beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| It went away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| I mean, these things just evolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| And Visit Knoxville is going to try to do something in the next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4317)|
| 1:12:00| as a festival-type event that will bring people to hotel, motel rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4320)|
| 1:12:04| But this didn't meet the mission of Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| And it cost $100,000 a year minimum every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| not counting what the city put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4331)|
| 1:12:12| That was a loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| Roughly most years was a loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| And so over the nine years that we had it, I think we've lost a half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| And so it just didn't fit the mission of Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| And the county's never participated anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| So it kind of makes me wonder why we're talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4349)|
| 1:12:30| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| I think Commissioner Andrews hit the nail on the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| I love Boomsday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4362)|
| 1:12:43| I enjoy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| Ed Brantley and I were involved at the beginning of this on the other side of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| It started as a radio promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4369)|
| 1:12:53| And it went from there, and we let a promotion, a private promotion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4373)|
| 1:12:59| where the private sector could no longer support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| be picked up by basically the tax dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4382)|
| 1:13:07| And I think that's very dangerous where we're taking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| we've just been complaining about the hotels, motels not paying their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4390)|
| 1:13:14| some of them not paying their taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| and yet we're spending some of their money on a losing proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4397)|
| 1:13:21| The only other thing I would add to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| if there was enough support in the community to bring it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4404)|
| 1:13:29| you'd have sponsors lining up every day to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4409)|
| 1:13:32| and I guarantee you we'd love to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4412)|
| 1:13:35| But it doesn't have the sponsor support like it did previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4415)|
| 1:13:39| no matter how long we talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| Well, the Saturday night on the town was brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| and I was personally involved with that as well as other people at WIVK| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| and ran that thing for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| And I can tell you from experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| you can't put on anything like that without selling beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| and a lot of Coca-Colas or things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4438)|
| 1:14:01| It just has to, you have to drive some revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| no matter how many sponsors you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| That's just part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| And I understand that with Boomstay, it's impossible to close off the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| rope it off so that beer can be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| The state will not let you rope off the road down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| So taking that money out of it, I don't see any way you can raise the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4460)|
| 1:14:26| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| One thing I've noticed is I have not noticed the hotel industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| the restaurant industry, or the vendors screaming to bring this back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| And to me, that speaks volumes about how the success has been on that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4477)|
| 1:14:42| I think Visit Knoxville could probably use this money in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| for some smaller fall festivals that actually do bring people in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| that spend two or three days in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4489)|
| 1:14:55| Is there any other discussion of this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4495)|
| 1:15:00| By virtue of being the chair of commission, I am a member of Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4500)|
| 1:15:07| You're the member appointed by commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| No, sir. I'm appointed by the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| That doesn't come with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| So there is no connection between Visit Knoxville and Knox County, as you've stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4514)|
| 1:15:21| So is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| If not, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4525)|
| 1:15:28| Next discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| Discussion regarding rural metro ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4531)|
| 1:15:39| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| Over the past, you know, there's been some newspaper articles we're all aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4543)|
| 1:15:48| a few things on television news about rural metro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| and we've had representatives from different ambulance services here in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4550)|
| 1:15:54| over the past few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| And I've had phone calls and conversations with people of Knox County about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4556)|
| 1:16:02| And a lot of people don't like what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| And I'm going to give you just a few examples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| and then I'm going to ask some questions that I would like Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| and or the law department to investigate before rural metro comes before this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4571)|
| 1:16:17| if it's agreeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| But one thing is, is that we've had complaints about rural metro not answering calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| or late arriving on calls because of a shortage of personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4583)|
| 1:16:27| We've had complaints and calls from them using other counties' emergency services and EMS people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4587)|
| 1:16:35| You know, one caller told me, one person told me that they told them to call someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4595)|
| 1:16:42| That's just unheard of to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| I do know for a fact of the lady who had a stroke at Turkey Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4604)|
| 1:16:51| it took over 30 minutes for the ambulance from rural metro to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4611)|
| 1:16:56| And it's on the same road as a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| That's unacceptable, totally unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| So here's my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| If this is going on, how often does rural metro refer 911 calls to other ambulance services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4627)|
| 1:17:15| Number two, do these calls still count against their 10-minute response time that they're responsible for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4635)|
| 1:17:23| And if not, why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| The citizens of Knox County are still in need of an ambulance in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4645)|
| 1:17:29| An ambulance coming from Grainger County, Blount County, or Union County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| cannot possibly meet the 10-minute response time to most areas of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4653)|
| 1:17:39| By turning the call over to another provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4659)|
| 1:17:42| does the county still hold rural metro accountable for that call and the monthly response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4662)|
| 1:17:49| Do they still have to be responsible for that evaluation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4669)|
| 1:17:53| Are all Knox County ambulance services that have locations in Knox County and pay taxes in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4673)|
| 1:17:59| why are they not utilized before going out of the county and picking up another service from another county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4679)|
| 1:18:07| And then finally, when rural metro sends other ambulance services, have they been inspected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4687)|
| 1:18:12| and do they meet Knox County specifications with proper equipment and appropriate personnel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4692)|
| 1:18:18| These are the questions I'd like to have answers for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| If this is going on, I want it to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| If it's not going on, then let's put it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| Mr. Law Director, I request that your department look into it if it's agreeable with commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4706)|
| 1:18:37| Mr. Law Director, would you care to weigh in on any of those on the request that's being given by my fellow commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4717)|
| 1:18:46| Well, the law director's office will be willing to do anything that this body directs it to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4726)|
| 1:18:54| I would also request maybe the health department kind of help us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4734)|
| 1:18:58| being as they manage the contract for rural metro and the ambulance service, if I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4738)|
| 1:19:05| But whatever this body requests, we'll try to look into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| and try to come up with some kind of answers to these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4748)|
| 1:19:15| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4755)|
| 1:19:16| I think Commissioner Rowles is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4756)|
| 1:19:19| I just had a question as to whether or not we had to make that request by resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4759)|
| 1:19:24| or if we could just casually ask the law department to look into something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4764)|
| 1:19:30| or if we needed to do it by resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4770)|
| 1:19:34| Generally, you usually just ask the law director to do it, but it's usually legal research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4774)|
| 1:19:39| This is more of an investigative piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| It wouldn't hurt my feelings if you gave me a better directive than I'm used to getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4782)|
| 1:19:48| So, Ed, would you and I like to co-sponsor exactly what you have written down there on next month's agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4788)|
| 1:19:57| Yes, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4797)|
| 1:19:58| I would like for this to happen, though, before rural metro does their presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| The reason for this was to come up with questions that we could ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4803)|
| 1:20:07| Right, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4807)|
| 1:20:08| And we can ask them these questions when they come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| Of course, they're going to know it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| But if this is going on, how will we know if...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| I agree, but can we not ask them to push their presentation back a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4816)|
| 1:20:21| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| Whatever you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| Commissioner Schoonmaker was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| I was just curious if there's any representatives from the health department here that might be able to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4829)|
| 1:20:36| I thought she was going to get away with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4836)|
| 1:20:46| Martha Buchanan, 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| I'm the director of the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4848)|
| 1:20:52| What's your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| Has rural metro been in contact with you or your office recently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| Yeah, we meet with them every month, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| We have oversight of their contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| We go over their contract and their contractual obligations every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| I have a staff member who gets regular texts and alerts about what's going on with staffing and ability to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4866)|
| 1:21:14| The contract allows for other providers to step in and respond when needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4874)|
| 1:21:19| That's a safety net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| I think it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| We have a pretty big county geographically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| and sometimes other counties are just closer to that part of the county than somebody inside the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4884)|
| 1:21:30| Some of these questions are really easy to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| Some of them require looking at some data because I don't have all the data in my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4892)|
| 1:21:37| but I'm happy to work with Bud and his office or anybody else and come up with answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4897)|
| 1:21:43| I was not aware that rural metro was making a presentation to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4903)|
| 1:21:49| I just heard that they were planning on doing something in October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| but I don't know if they've said something to you or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4913)|
| 1:21:58| Well, I heard it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| I just heard it just now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| No, they haven't said anything to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4921)|
| 1:22:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| And I wouldn't necessarily be part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| And did you give your questions, Mr. Brantley, to some?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4926)|
| 1:22:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4930)|
| 1:22:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4931)|
| 1:22:12| Because I tried to write them down, but I can't write as fast as he can talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| No, I gave a copy to Bud, and he'll be happy to give it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4938)|
| 1:22:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| Yeah, we're happy to answer these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4942)|
| 1:22:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4943)|
| 1:22:24| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| I don't have anything for you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| I guess my statement is wouldn't this be better in a joint letter by our chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4949)|
| 1:22:38| and Dr. Buchanan to give them an advance notice of what we're expecting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4958)|
| 1:22:44| I mean, to me it's not really research, as Bud said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| It's kind of hard for him to kind of hire a PI on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| I mean, to me, if we phrase these questions in a way that were pretty clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4971)|
| 1:22:57| as far as giving clear answers back to us, maybe that's the route to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4977)|
| 1:23:02| and give them X number of days and weeks to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4982)|
| 1:23:07| But I'll say these are great questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| I agree these questions need to be answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| So I just want to get the most direct way of getting that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| Dr. Buchanan, if you don't mind, since you said some of these had easy answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5000)|
| 1:23:25| would you mind if we asked you these questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| I would not mind if you asked me those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5011)|
| 1:23:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5012)|
| 1:23:33| The ones I can answer, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5013)|
| 1:23:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| Because the one that really knocked me out was the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| are the other counties up to our standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| They've been inspected and so forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| Yes, any ambulance company that operates within Knox County meets the same standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5029)|
| 1:23:54| So if they're going to operate in our county, and they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| because sometimes they come across the county line for different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5037)|
| 1:24:01| or they have to transport somebody into Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| they couldn't very well stop at the county line and trade out ambulances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5043)|
| 1:24:07| That wouldn't be very efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| So people who operate in the contiguous counties have the same standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5049)|
| 1:24:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| Let me just quickly then ask some of these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| How often does rural metro refer 911 calls to other ambulance services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5058)|
| 1:24:22| Is there a percentage in there or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5062)|
| 1:24:25| That one's one I don't have off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| That's a data question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5067)|
| 1:24:28| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5068)|
| 1:24:29| And if you don't know, just say pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| Do these calls still count against their 10-minute response time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| I will have to look at the contract because I don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5077)|
| 1:24:41| So pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| I'm going to pass on that one because I don't want to give you the wrong information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5082)|
| 1:24:45| By turning the call to another provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| does the county still hold rural metro accountable for that call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| and the monthly response evaluation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| Again, that's a contract issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5096)|
| 1:24:57| And are all the Knox County ambulance services that have locations in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5097)|
| 1:25:02| and pay taxes in Knox County utilized before we would go out of the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5102)|
| 1:25:08| I'm going to give a tentative answer to that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| and we can ask rural metro more about that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| What happens when they go to level zero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| is they look at where they have all their ambulances stationed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| or they don't have any ambulances at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| and they look at who's the closest to where all the activity is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| and they put them on notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5127)|
| 1:25:28| They say Blount County or they say Priority or whomever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5128)|
| 1:25:34| we don't put you on notice, here's where we are, we might need to call on you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| so that they stand an ambulance up in a certain place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5141)|
| 1:25:42| Ambulances post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5142)|
| 1:25:43| If you've noticed ambulances sitting around, they're not doing nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5143)|
| 1:25:46| They are doing nothing, but they're waiting for calls too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5146)|
| 1:25:49| So they post in different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5149)|
| 1:25:50| So they put an ambulance strategically where there's a lot of activity based on the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5150)|
| 1:25:54| and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5154)|
| 1:25:55| So they'll stand that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5155)|
| 1:25:56| The minute another ambulance comes available, another rural metro ambulance comes available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5156)|
| 1:26:00| they stand down that ambulance and they're back to level one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5160)|
| 1:26:04| And that can occur in seconds or minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| Several ambulances can be released from the hospital all at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| So it's a very dynamic process, and they will know it much better than I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5170)|
| 1:26:14| since they do it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| I think the question was whether or not other services that are in Knox County are used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5175)|
| 1:26:20| before going out of county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5180)|
| 1:26:21| You'd have to ask them that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5181)|
| 1:26:22| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| Then that would be the last one on the list there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| So we'll just refer to it and get some answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5186)|
| 1:26:29| I appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5189)|
| 1:26:30| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5190)|
| 1:26:31| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5191)|
| 1:26:32| Can I add an answer to that question, if you don't mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| A lot of those ambulances that are in town are BLS trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| which are equipped with two EMTs or just maybe a transfer truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5198)|
| 1:26:42| So there's an ALS and a BLS question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| That does a lot to determine who's available to answer an emergency call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5204)|
| 1:26:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5210)|
| 1:26:55| These are not pointed questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| You could say I don't want to answer them or whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| but we do have standards, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| Who sets those standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5223)|
| 1:27:04| Well, some of the standards are set by the state EMS board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| Some of the standards are set by the county when we have the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5228)|
| 1:27:13| But as far as requirements on ambulances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| and what has to be on an ambulance in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| that's a state-level decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| And then we have some additional contractual requirements about ALS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5241)|
| 1:27:25| versus BLS for responses within our contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5245)|
| 1:27:30| And then the response times are set by the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| as well as the percentage of time they have to get there in under 10 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5253)|
| 1:27:38| and all those other contractual things for which they're fined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| Those are set by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5262)|
| 1:27:44| Who checks to make sure that these standards are met?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| My staff and I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5267)|
| 1:27:48| We review that every week, every month, not every week, sorry, every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5268)|
| 1:27:53| And when you find a lacking in standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| what's the procedure that this is filled out to let people know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| that they're not at the standards they should be at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5280)|
| 1:28:03| Well, we follow the contractual process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| and there's a letter notifying them of their fines and why they get those fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5286)|
| 1:28:11| We are not the inspectors of ambulances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| We are not the ones who license ambulances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| That's the Tennessee EMS folks at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5296)|
| 1:28:21| So we don't have that regulatory piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| We have the did you meet the Knox County contract regulatory piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5303)|
| 1:28:28| which they're not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5310)|
| 1:28:31| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5311)|
| 1:28:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5312)|
| 1:28:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| Commissioner Thomas, I mean Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5316)|
| 1:28:39| Brantley, Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| I apologize over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5321)|
| 1:28:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5322)|
| 1:28:43| May I ask you another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5325)|
| 1:28:46| This information that you review monthly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| that's the information that Rural Metro gives you, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5331)|
| 1:28:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| Thank you, Mr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5335)|
| 1:28:56| What we have done this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| is discuss what we see as questions that should be asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5339)|
| 1:29:04| not waiting until we get a presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| and then ask questions which can't be answered maybe by Rural Metro at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5347)|
| 1:29:13| So it's best they know they need to be prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| if they're coming to address full commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5356)|
| 1:29:19| and we'll close this discussion by comments from the law director, Mr. Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5359)|
| 1:29:27| Well, after the discussion, I just want to be clear what it is you want me to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5367)|
| 1:29:32| because a lot of the questions were asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| I have no problem working with Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| I have no problem even putting my investigator on this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5377)|
| 1:29:41| between now and whenever they decide to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| I just kind of want to know, just get some clarity what it is you want us to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5385)|
| 1:29:50| so that we all know specifically, Mr. Brantley, since you brought it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5390)|
| 1:29:55| what do you want us to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| Well, I mean, she said she could answer the questions, and clearly she couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| So, again, the questions are there to be answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| Now, we can wait until they come in in September and ask these same questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| which is fine, and that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| My goal is to bring attention to something that I know is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5412)|
| 1:30:17| I get calls all the time, and I think as a community and as Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5417)|
| 1:30:24| we're just saying, oh, well, that's the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| It doesn't have to be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| It doesn't have to, and that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| Now, I'm not asking you to go out of your way to go look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| We can just have these questions, and if they come, we can ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5434)|
| 1:30:39| And, of course, I don't know how you back up, like she said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5439)|
| 1:30:43| She gets her information from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| Is it the truth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| Yeah, I think probably Sam had the best suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| which is just a letter from our esteemed chairman to Rural Metro saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5455)|
| 1:31:00| if you're coming to make a presentation, these are the questions we would like answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| I believe they need to have those questions ahead of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5464)|
| 1:31:07| because as Dr. McKinnon said, a lot of those are data questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| that they're going to have to dig into to get the answers to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| And then once we get those answers at next month's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| we can decide an appropriate next step at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| depending on the answers that we receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| So that would be my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5492)|
| 1:31:33| I'm confident Dr. Buchanan does her utmost to do this checking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5493)|
| 1:31:41| but this is a suggestion that since we're looking at a timeline here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5501)|
| 1:31:47| if she has an area that she looks at figures they give her and questions it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5507)|
| 1:31:52| then she could use the law department's investigator to do some follow-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5512)|
| 1:31:57| and double-check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| That way you have a two-shot look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5521)|
| 1:32:06| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| I'm sort of a novice at what ambulance protection is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5529)|
| 1:32:14| but since Dr. Buchanan is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5534)|
| 1:32:17| if she had a wish list of what a good ambulance service is and needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5537)|
| 1:32:28| then I wondered if we could get that wish list and then see what we have now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5548)|
| 1:32:35| and so we can ask the questions of here's where we are, here's where we should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5555)|
| 1:32:41| how do we get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| But I don't know the questions to ask of what is needed in an ambulance service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5563)|
| 1:32:50| So that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| Maybe where we sit right at the moment is the fact that we have in place a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| that we wrote the specifications to and they were the successful bidder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5577)|
| 1:33:02| and now we look at their performance under that contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5582)|
| 1:33:06| and we have general questions which the suggestion of Commissioner Broyles is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5586)|
| 1:33:13| that we formally get those questions asked of Rural Metro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5593)|
| 1:33:21| and they incorporate that in their presentation to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5601)|
| 1:33:26| if they are coming to make a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| If they are not coming to make a presentation, I will request that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5608)|
| 1:33:34| Commissioner Brennan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5614)|
| 1:33:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| In the past few months, we've heard so much about the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5617)|
| 1:33:42| and the role that the Audit Committee is doing in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| and we see the results of that Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| We've even talked about the county clerk having their own auditor now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| and that's what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| I just want to make sure the citizens of Knox County are getting the service they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5634)|
| 1:33:59| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5641)|
| 1:34:02| I was just wondering if, Dr. Buchanan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| if you were aware of when Rural Metro had their September review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5645)|
| 1:34:11| since you said it's monthly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| The September review will not happen until later in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| So we reviewed August's numbers today, literally today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5661)|
| 1:34:26| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| And those are based on what's in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5668)|
| 1:34:32| We review the requirements that are written in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5672)|
| 1:34:36| That's the piece that we review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| We have confidence in Rural Metro's ability to serve the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5678)|
| 1:34:45| and there have been staffing issues that they're working very hard to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5685)|
| 1:34:50| and that we're asking them about on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5690)|
| 1:34:54| Those are not unique to Rural Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| There have been some changes at the state level around how the state is allowing people to become an A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5696)|
| 1:35:06| They're A and B paramedics and an A paramedic is the higher level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5706)|
| 1:35:10| There have been changes which limit access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5710)|
| 1:35:13| and limit people being able to pursue that career field, honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5713)|
| 1:35:17| which are impacting staffing not just in Knox County but also in other counties across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5717)|
| 1:35:23| We're seeing that in other counties as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| So we do that once a month and we look at the data that is in the contract to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5726)|
| 1:35:33| And it looked good today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| I'm not going to say numbers because I'll say them wrong because I can't remember them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5736)|
| 1:35:43| There were some fines assessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| I can't tell you the exact dollar amount because I just don't have that kind of memory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| but there were fines assessed for response time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5750)|
| 1:35:55| for not getting there within the appropriate amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| There are two different response times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| There's a 10-minute response time and the 17-minute response time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5760)|
| 1:36:04| There's a 10-minute response time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| An ambulance or a first responder can meet that requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| And then if the ambulance still takes more than 17 minutes to get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5769)|
| 1:36:13| first responders there taking care of the person, meeting their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| Ambulance takes more than 17 minutes to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| They get fined for some of those unless there are things like a tree in the middle of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5780)|
| 1:36:25| that they can do nothing about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| They're coming from the other side and the first responders came from this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| They get fined for non-emergency calls that take over 45 minutes to respond to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5791)|
| 1:36:38| And of those, they did get some fines this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5798)|
| 1:36:41| but they had several thousand calls and had 55 that took more than 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5801)|
| 1:36:48| But I want to emphasize those are non-emergency calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| Those are calls for various things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| You'd be surprised what people call an ambulance for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| And then they get fined for not meeting the 90% response time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5816)|
| 1:37:01| So 90% of the time, they have to be there within 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| And 90% of the time, they were this month, more than 90% of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5825)|
| 1:37:09| So they met that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| There's no fine for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5830)|
| 1:37:11| And then they get fined when they're level zeros.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5831)|
| 1:37:14| And I believe there was a level zero this month, or in August, not this month, but last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5834)|
| 1:37:20| So that's a fine that's assessed as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| And, again, that's all spelled out in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| How those fines are calculated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| And didn't I read that you recently had worked with the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5848)|
| 1:37:32| to get them to release ambulances quicker from the UT Medical Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5852)|
| 1:37:37| We continue to work with UT and other medical centers to release ambulances more quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5857)|
| 1:37:43| Our hospitals run at pretty full capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| and sometimes it takes a while to get a bed in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5866)|
| 1:37:49| So what happens sometimes is you'll have two or three ambulances stacked up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5869)|
| 1:37:55| waiting to unload a patient who's stable, just doesn't have a bed to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5875)|
| 1:38:00| So they can't just leave the patient on the side in the ambulance bay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5880)|
| 1:38:03| That's not appropriate, so they don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5883)|
| 1:38:06| And so that ambulance can't be out picking people up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| So we are working with the hospitals to make some adjustments to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| And we're also looking at those non-emergency calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5894)|
| 1:38:17| and how to triage those calls and prioritize those better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5897)|
| 1:38:22| So, yes, there's a lot of work being done to keep people safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| Great. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5907)|
| 1:38:28| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5908)|
| 1:38:31| Yes, just so I'm clear, because, like Commissioner Bussler said, I'm not an expert on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5911)|
| 1:38:38| The start time comes from 9-1-1 when they log the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5918)|
| 1:38:43| And when does the end time come, when somebody says, I'm here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5923)|
| 1:38:47| When either the first responder or the rural metro ambulance is on the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5927)|
| 1:38:54| How does somebody know they're on the scene?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| Great question for somebody who does operations in an ambulance company, which is not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5937)|
| 1:39:02| Great question for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| I think there are probably various ways they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5944)|
| 1:39:07| I think the person, the first responder, the ambulance guy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5947)|
| 1:39:10| can write it down or document it in their documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| or they may notify the dispatcher that they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| So there are different ways they do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| Sure. I just had no clue, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5960)|
| 1:39:21| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5962)|
| 1:39:23| Two things on the non-emergency calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| You know, every body that goes to the forensic center requires an ambulance transport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5966)|
| 1:39:31| That's taking ambulances off the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| We probably need to rethink that methodology a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5972)|
| 1:39:37| Another thing is on the on-scene time, or the 1097 time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5977)|
| 1:39:43| Some of that's done through AVL, or vehicle locator, and some of it's done on radio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5983)|
| 1:39:48| But it's never just a handwritten, it's up to the dispatcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| And so there's things that need to be tweaked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| There's things that can get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| But overall, I mean, I've waited on an ambulance, too, on scene on an emergency call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| and it's frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| But, you know, there's flaws, there's shortages, and those things have to be worked out on a state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6001)|
| 1:40:08| I mean, Rowan State's not pumping out EMTs and paramedics like they used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6008)|
| 1:40:12| That's part of the issue is the state is holding back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| Rural Metro has had to go to Kentucky to get trained paramedics and EMTs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| So we need to do better at that as a state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6018)|
| 1:40:22| Mr. Law Director, you have the last word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| It is just a final statement since it all started over here and pointed over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| What we will do, the law director's office will get with Dr. Buchanan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6030)|
| 1:40:34| and then together we will determine what role you want us to play or not play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| and kind of figure out what's really going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| and try to have some response back for you if it's deemed necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6040)|
| 1:40:45| And we'll be ready for your meeting one way or the other collectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6045)|
| 1:40:50| Thank you, Ms. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6050)|
| 1:40:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6051)|
| 1:40:52| Next discussion item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| Discussion regarding the overcrowding at the detention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6056)|
| 1:41:00| While the sheriff is coming to the microphone or his representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6060)|
| 1:41:06| I would ask that everyone note the letter that was received from the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6066)|
| 1:41:23| Jimmy Jones, 400 East Main.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| And it's only because you're a L162.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| You're just a shadow of your former self.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| I am a mere shadow of my former self.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6092)|
| 1:41:37| This is not the first time that we've talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6097)|
| 1:41:39| Some of the commissioners that have been here for a while have listened to me say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6099)|
| 1:41:43| in the not-too-distant future we're going to have to spend millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6103)|
| 1:41:48| of Knox County taxpayer money to house prisoners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6108)|
| 1:41:55| So I felt it incumbent on me when I wrote you this letter this time to bring my experts with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6115)|
| 1:42:01| so you would have a little more knowledge of what we have done already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6121)|
| 1:42:07| through the process of using our budgetary money to let you know that we have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6127)|
| 1:42:14| just about everything that we can do now as far as double bunking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6134)|
| 1:42:19| and moving people around in classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6139)|
| 1:42:21| So ultimately I want you to know that we have done our part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6141)|
| 1:42:25| and it is now coming to the end of the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6145)|
| 1:42:29| So I want to make sure that everybody knows that this is something that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6149)|
| 1:42:34| I also have Special Counsel Nichols here to talk about the safety center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6154)|
| 1:42:39| and I have added that into the letter also, not to say that that is going to be a fix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6159)|
| 1:42:44| and with that we won't have to build another pod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6164)|
| 1:42:47| But at some point in the time in the not-too-distant future, this is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6167)|
| 1:42:52| So I want you to know what we've done and be up to date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6172)|
| 1:42:55| so that we all understand how hard we have worked to try to keep this from coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6175)|
| 1:43:01| But it's still coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| So Rodney is going to start first and tell you what we have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6183)|
| 1:43:07| at the detention facility to try to alleviate this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6187)|
| 1:43:14| Rodney Bivens, 400 West Main Street, Suite L192.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6194)|
| 1:43:18| I am the Director of Corrections for the Sheriff's Office and Personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6198)|
| 1:43:23| Kind of give you a little history about what we've done at the detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6203)|
| 1:43:28| In 2005 we added Building 1, a new pod, additional pod,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6208)|
| 1:43:33| and then straight behind that we started double bunking every area that we could double bunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6213)|
| 1:43:39| It still meets state law and our guidelines of the people that oversee our facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6219)|
| 1:43:46| So we've double bunked every bed that we can double bunk at the detention facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6226)|
| 1:43:51| which has kind of got us to now with our bed space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6231)|
| 1:43:56| and a couple of times in the past couple of months we've went above and beyond those numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6236)|
| 1:44:02| and we've had people in our intake pods and stuff that have exceeded the cap of that housing unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6242)|
| 1:44:11| And I think what's very important that the Commission knows is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6251)|
| 1:44:16| those that were on the Commission before knows that it takes approximately two, two and a half years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6256)|
| 1:44:22| once you decide that you're going to build a unit onto the facility to get those designs together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6262)|
| 1:44:27| and then of course construct and open those units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| So I think we would be remiss if we didn't let the Commission know that we are now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6270)|
| 1:44:35| with all the stuff that we have done and also we've had a Judicial Committee that works on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6275)|
| 1:44:41| trying to keep people out of the, as many people as they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6281)|
| 1:44:44| diverting them from the jails, that type of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| And now we're looking at a lot of failure to appears, that type of stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6286)|
| 1:44:50| or that they just didn't abide by what the judicial system has put in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6290)|
| 1:44:55| to try to keep them out and get them into different types of programming and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| And now we're getting a lot of that violations that comes back in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| which then puts those sentences back into full effect and thus bringing our numbers up also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6302)|
| 1:45:11| We have really been over backwards working with the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| keeping, we've got our federal order that's against us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6314)|
| 1:45:18| and we work really close with the state about getting their prisoners out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6318)|
| 1:45:21| Sometimes we have to make a little scene about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6321)|
| 1:45:25| that we've got too many of your inmates that are over the 14 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| and we'll get them out pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| And the state facilities, what they're telling us, is full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6330)|
| 1:45:35| But they do a pretty good job at keeping the state inmates out of the facility pretty quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6335)|
| 1:45:39| and getting them out of our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6339)|
| 1:45:44| I guess it's kind of where we're at at this point in time with the facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6344)|
| 1:45:49| Commissioner McKenzie, do you have a question of Mr. Bevins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6349)|
| 1:45:56| Commissioner Owenby, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6358)|
| 1:46:01| So it's 14 days the state has to remove any inmate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6361)|
| 1:46:05| that's supposed to go into a state jail or a federal jail, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| Basically what happens is when we get a sentence down from the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| saying that they're sentenced to the Department of Corrections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| we have to send that to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6374)|
| 1:46:16| And then from the time they receive that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6376)|
| 1:46:18| they have 14 days to get that inmate out of our custody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6378)|
| 1:46:21| How many surrounding counties do we have inmates that are supposed to be going to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6381)|
| 1:46:26| How long do they stay here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| With us from surrounding counties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| Yes, say it's Anderson County or Morgan County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6390)|
| 1:46:33| or that we're holding somebody on a violation waiting to ship them back to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6393)|
| 1:46:38| We don't necessarily hold for that other county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| We may have charges also in that county, get someone sentenced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6401)|
| 1:46:45| and then they come over to us for our charges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| which we can at that point in time if the state gives us a bed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| and they want to take that Anderson County or whatever county inmate, they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6410)|
| 1:46:54| But we don't necessarily call the other counties and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| hey, send us all your state, we'll get them out for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| Commissioner Thomas, do you have a question of Mr. Bevins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| Yes, Mr. Chairman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| Just two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6427)|
| 1:47:12| I'm assuming there is an average of X amount of population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| about what your jail population will be as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6436)|
| 1:47:22| some kind of figure on just your average population in the South perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6442)|
| 1:47:27| Is there some sort of factor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6447)|
| 1:47:30| Let's say if a half million people live here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| is there usually an average percentage of how many end up being in jail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| I'm sure there is studies out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6456)|
| 1:47:38| I couldn't give you that number right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6458)|
| 1:47:39| Okay, and that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6459)|
| 1:47:40| I just didn't know if there was some kind of thing that a lot of people look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| Let's say tomorrow we decided to build a new pod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6463)|
| 1:47:49| How long would it take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| Approximately probably two and a half, three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6471)|
| 1:47:55| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6475)|
| 1:47:59| Commissioner Broyles, do you have a question of Mr. Bevins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6479)|
| 1:48:04| Actually, this is, I guess, more for JJ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6484)|
| 1:48:09| Also, Bob, I think the research has shown that you can tell how much space you're going to need available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6489)|
| 1:48:17| in your detention facility based on third grade reading level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6497)|
| 1:48:24| That's a pretty good indicator for your future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6504)|
| 1:48:28| what your future community's needs are going to be in terms of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6508)|
| 1:48:31| of people who need to be in detention facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6511)|
| 1:48:38| Of course, I have been and continue to be a huge supporter of the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6518)|
| 1:48:43| I would love to see that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6525)|
| 1:48:46| I brought General Nichols too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6526)|
| 1:48:47| Maybe he can speak to that for just a couple of minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6527)|
| 1:48:50| Also, I wanted to ask, Jeff, I don't know if you noticed this at the NACO annual conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6530)|
| 1:48:55| but jail overcrowding and pretrial release has been a huge issue across the country and not just here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6535)|
| 1:49:05| I mean, this is going on across the country and it's become a huge issue for NACO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6545)|
| 1:49:09| We had multiple workshops available at the annual conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6549)|
| 1:49:14| lots of handouts, literature, training sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6554)|
| 1:49:18| So I'm wondering if you've been able to get in touch with any of your peers around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6558)|
| 1:49:27| Have you been able to access any materials or resources through NACO that might give you some new information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6567)|
| 1:49:37| or some new ideas or something that might be working somewhere else that we haven't tried here yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6577)|
| 1:49:43| or just thrown out some ideas, some way to help us keep from having to build another pod?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6583)|
| 1:49:53| Randy Nichols, 400 Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6593)|
| 1:49:58| Yes, Commissioner, we are spending a considerable amount of time on trying to study every other jurisdiction we can find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6598)|
| 1:50:07| that has made some progress in dealing with this very issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6607)|
| 1:50:12| You have correctly pointed out that this is not just Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6612)|
| 1:50:15| This is a nationwide dilemma that we're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6615)|
| 1:50:20| It seems that every time that we take a step to address it, it doesn't work out so well sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6620)|
| 1:50:26| As the sheriff mentioned to you, we decided and the state decided that we would issue citations in lieu of arrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6626)|
| 1:50:35| such that you wouldn't be there and would be told when to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6635)|
| 1:50:40| Well, what happened to us is that nobody showed up when they were told to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6640)|
| 1:50:45| and then another warrant is issued by the court for failure to appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6645)|
| 1:50:50| So you've doubled your trouble, and you are then going to the jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| and you're going to stay there without a bond until you can see a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6654)|
| 1:51:00| So you see we push here, we push there, and it seems that it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6660)|
| 1:51:05| I would remind the members of the Commission that we are also in the middle of an epidemic of prescription drug abuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6665)|
| 1:51:14| that's driving this problem, and it's not only driving it here, it's driving it everywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6674)|
| 1:51:20| but it's particularly strong here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6680)|
| 1:51:24| And so I have been unable yet to figure out the solution to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6684)|
| 1:51:32| The safety center, the sheriff's on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6692)|
| 1:51:34| The sheriff's pushing. He wants me to go some quicker on this safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6694)|
| 1:51:39| We are trying to do it in a fashion, ladies and gentlemen, that when we do start it, it will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6699)|
| 1:51:46| We cannot design this safety center, this diversion center, to fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6706)|
| 1:51:52| That's what's taking the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6712)|
| 1:51:54| We're trying to see where has it worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6714)|
| 1:51:58| I can tell you there are some cities it's working very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6718)|
| 1:52:01| Fort Worth, Texas comes to mind right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6721)|
| 1:52:04| It's the best operating safety center dealing with the mentally ill and those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6724)|
| 1:52:10| Of course, that was a $25 million expenditure in Fort Worth, Texas, too, that we don't have to spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6730)|
| 1:52:18| Isn't there one also in, I want to say Phoenix?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6738)|
| 1:52:21| Phoenix, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6741)|
| 1:52:22| There's one Phoenix, Tempe area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6742)|
| 1:52:25| Yes, Tempe, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6745)|
| 1:52:26| Ohio has got a very good place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6746)|
| 1:52:29| They're seeing some success on the diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6749)|
| 1:52:32| New York City's seeing some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6752)|
| 1:52:33| There's several that are seeing some success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6753)|
| 1:52:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6756)|
| 1:52:37| And it's true that there is a huge problem with prescription drug abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6757)|
| 1:52:42| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6762)|
| 1:52:43| But it's also true that there have been some strides made recently in cutting down on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6763)|
| 1:52:48| But I would like to point out that as those drugs have come off the streets, we're seeing an increase in heroin abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6768)|
| 1:52:56| Heroin is actually cheaper, as it turns out, and is becoming easier to get now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6776)|
| 1:53:02| And it's easier to overdose on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6782)|
| 1:53:04| Yes, ma'am, you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6784)|
| 1:53:05| So as we are getting the prescription drug problem under control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6785)|
| 1:53:10| we're actually seeing the heroin problem mushroom clouding, or however you want to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6790)|
| 1:53:17| It's becoming a bigger and bigger problem than prescription drugs have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6797)|
| 1:53:23| So it's not just that prescription drugs are the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| The problem is that we've got people addicted to mind-altering substances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6807)|
| 1:53:31| and we need to address it holistically, not just that it's just a one-drug problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6811)|
| 1:53:37| It's a multiple-drug problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6817)|
| 1:53:39| Very well said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6819)|
| 1:53:40| Commissioner Broyles, I thought you were going to ask a question of Mr. Bevins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6820)|
| 1:53:45| but I had skipped over Commissioner McKenzie for the purpose of asking questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6825)|
| 1:53:50| We've now found ourselves further down the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6830)|
| 1:53:55| I'm remiss over here on this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6835)|
| 1:53:57| I do not know, was it Commissioner Anders or Commissioner Brown next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6837)|
| 1:54:01| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6841)|
| 1:54:03| I think the general has kind of started a conversation that I wanted to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6843)|
| 1:54:08| And a little bit of it is, you know, building a pod is a part of the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6848)|
| 1:54:13| It's going to be a multi-pronged, long-term, if this is going to be a long-term fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6853)|
| 1:54:17| Recidivism is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6857)|
| 1:54:20| Drug dependency is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6860)|
| 1:54:22| Drug court, veteran court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| We need to open our minds up to spending money on GPS monitoring of nonviolent offenders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6864)|
| 1:54:30| and tracking their whereabouts and limiting them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| have the judges limiting them to their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6872)|
| 1:54:35| We've got to open our minds up to not just one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| The pod just continues having a prison system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6877)|
| 1:54:40| but we've got to open our minds up as a county to do other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6880)|
| 1:54:43| I know that property crimes is what drives the crime rate for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6883)|
| 1:54:49| and I guess it's for the country, but property crimes is what drives that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| And if you keep a property crimes offender in, shoplifter, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6892)|
| 1:54:57| taking up a bed space where you should have a burglar in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6897)|
| 1:55:01| So we've got to really open our eyes to GPS tracking these folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6901)|
| 1:55:06| violating them when they do violate, and having a multi-pronged approach to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6906)|
| 1:55:11| Just building a pod doesn't fix it all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| and I think Chief Bivens and the sheriff and General Nichols would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6913)|
| 1:55:17| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6917)|
| 1:55:19| To answer your question, I'm not sure which one of those questions that we're on to either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6919)|
| 1:55:25| but since it's a general discussion, and I think J.J. would agree with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6925)|
| 1:55:32| even if we built this pod, and I'm sure former General Nichols would also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6932)|
| 1:55:40| even if we still built that pod, we're still going to need a detention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6940)|
| 1:55:44| because this is a problem. It's not going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6944)|
| 1:55:47| So to me, it seems the best angle to attack it from that one first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6947)|
| 1:55:53| then if you have to expand the other way, then you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6953)|
| 1:55:57| But here we're trying to cut the legs out from under this animal before it grows so big we can't catch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6957)|
| 1:56:04| But if we build another pod, all we're doing is stacking the cordwood up higher out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6964)|
| 1:56:09| and doing nothing to take care of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6969)|
| 1:56:14| Now, we had at one time Helen Ross McNabb agreeing to operate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6974)|
| 1:56:23| Did we not, Mr. Nichols?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6983)|
| 1:56:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6985)|
| 1:56:26| I'm assuming they're still agreeable to doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6986)|
| 1:56:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6991)|
| 1:56:32| So where are we at this point in the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=6992)|
| 1:56:41| We have a lot next to them there, right, next to their place to build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7001)|
| 1:56:48| Where are we in the process now of getting this done, and what is it going to take to finish it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7008)|
| 1:56:56| I guess that's probably the best question to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7016)|
| 1:57:03| Mayor Burchett has put money in the budget to help construct the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7023)|
| 1:57:08| The city of Knoxville, through Mayor O'Hara, has indicated support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7028)|
| 1:57:13| and would put money behind it to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7033)|
| 1:57:16| The state of Tennessee has said they will give us some money for operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7036)|
| 1:57:21| They will not invest in any building, but they will help us on operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7041)|
| 1:57:28| So those pieces are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7048)|
| 1:57:31| Where they've been looked at to physically locate it is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7051)|
| 1:57:39| The problem that we have is that when we take you to the Diversion Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7059)|
| 1:57:46| we can keep you and watch you and monitor you fairly well for about eight days to get you stabilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7066)|
| 1:57:54| We can get you sober and get you back on your medicines in that period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7074)|
| 1:58:01| through either the Safety Diversion Center or the CSU that will be nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7081)|
| 1:58:07| So we've got it where we feel very comfortable with that limited period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7087)|
| 1:58:13| where we can control your behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7093)|
| 1:58:17| The problem with it is that what happens after that period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7097)|
| 1:58:22| And quite frankly, in this state, we do not have a statute in this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7102)|
| 1:58:27| We are one of five states in America that do not have a law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7107)|
| 1:58:32| that allows a judge to order you to take your medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7112)|
| 1:58:38| We don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| We thought we had a statute that would work for us, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7120)|
| 1:58:45| that we could use the statute to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7125)|
| 1:58:48| So when the mother or the sister or the granny or whomever it was came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7128)|
| 1:58:52| and told the judge, Randy here won't take his medicine, and the judge had ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7132)|
| 1:58:57| We thought we had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7137)|
| 1:58:58| We don't have it that's workable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7138)|
| 1:59:00| Our chancellors have pointed out it's not workable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7140)|
| 1:59:03| So we've got to get some other statutes from the state to shore us up a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7143)|
| 1:59:09| or we're buying a very short period of time of peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7149)|
| 1:59:13| And so we're underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7153)|
| 1:59:16| We've had discussions with members of the General Assembly to sponsor it, to get it passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7156)|
| 1:59:21| I don't think it will be a complicated piece of legislation to get passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7161)|
| 1:59:26| I doubt there will be much controversy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7166)|
| 1:59:29| But once that's in place, then everything comes back to where we're in the catbird seat again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7169)|
| 1:59:36| where we can lean on you, as it were, in a respectful way, a way to make you do and to keep you sober.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7176)|
| 1:59:45| But until then, I worry that we're buying eight days of peace and quiet, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7185)|
| 1:59:52| and then we're chasing you one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7192)|
| 1:59:55| Well, the best thing I can remember from our discussion, you know, this is a big outlay up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7195)|
| 2:00:03| But if these folks go through the detention center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7203)|
| 2:00:08| then right now J.J. and county money is buying 100 percent of their drugs out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7208)|
| 2:00:15| But if they go through this detention center, then if they have health insurance or TennCare or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7215)|
| 2:00:23| then TennCare winds up paying for that, which I think ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7223)|
| 2:00:29| I don't remember the figure you gave us, J.J., originally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7229)|
| 2:00:31| but was it somewhere in the close to a million dollars a year that we could save on drugs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7231)|
| 2:00:38| I think roughly $670,000, $600,000 a year the county spends on psychotropic medications at the detention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7238)|
| 2:00:48| Well, that is a step in the right direction and a step toward paying for the center itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7248)|
| 2:00:55| I mean, the fact that we can save that much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7255)|
| 2:01:00| Right now, if J.J. lets them go after 72 hours out there, we give them a handful of pills and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7260)|
| 2:01:07| please don't come back, but you know you're going to see them again next week, and you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7267)|
| 2:01:15| Whereas if they had this detention center, they have a chance to get some professional help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7275)|
| 2:01:21| that he does not have available out there that could possibly, you know, if you save one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7281)|
| 2:01:27| or two out of ten, what have you, we're eventually going to be head of the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7287)|
| 2:01:36| Who do we need to line a match under or get a hold of to make the change that you need in this law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7296)|
| 2:01:46| Does it need to come from this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7306)|
| 2:01:50| What should be our next step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7310)|
| 2:01:54| Like I said, we've talked with members of the House and the Senate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7314)|
| 2:01:57| that would be willing to sponsor the legislation to get through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7317)|
| 2:02:01| I think they go into session about January the 12th, so if we can continue to work towards it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7321)|
| 2:02:07| and the law comes into effect, it would be fairly immediate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7327)|
| 2:02:10| I wouldn't know of any reason that we couldn't move forward at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7330)|
| 2:02:14| Well, but do we, there's no reason for us to wait until that law goes into effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7334)|
| 2:02:22| before we take some steps, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7342)|
| 2:02:24| No, I think we need to be moving towards it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7344)|
| 2:02:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7346)|
| 2:02:27| Yes, sir, by all means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7347)|
| 2:02:28| Yes, sir, you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| Thank you, Mr. Dickinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7350)|
| 2:02:32| Commissioner Oenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7352)|
| 2:02:33| Yes, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7353)|
| 2:02:35| Pardon me, Commissioner Oenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7355)|
| 2:02:37| We are 14 minutes away from zoning, so if we could begin to wrap up our questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7357)|
| 2:02:44| Commissioner Oenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7364)|
| 2:02:45| I'll make it quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7365)|
| 2:02:47| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7367)|
| 2:02:50| Amy's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7370)|
| 2:02:52| I've been to NACO three times now, and all three times I've sat down with people from San Antonio area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7372)|
| 2:02:59| that have, they don't call it a safety center, they call it a transition center or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7379)|
| 2:03:06| and people from Phoenix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7386)|
| 2:03:09| They've got a wonderful program, but theirs is on a regional basis also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7389)|
| 2:03:14| It more encompasses all the counties around us, which is where a lot of our mentally ill come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7394)|
| 2:03:21| I sat down with Mr. Nichols and Chief Trammell and a few others in July when I got back from NACO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7401)|
| 2:03:29| and everybody knows I wasn't a proponent of the safety center before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7409)|
| 2:03:33| but since the closure of Lakeshore, we have a mental issue in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7413)|
| 2:03:39| and 25% of our inmates in our jails now are mentally ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7419)|
| 2:03:45| It costs us three times more in the county jails to house them than it would be in a safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7425)|
| 2:03:53| I'd like to see the safety center move forward, and I told you that in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7433)|
| 2:03:58| We need to get this law passed, but before that, we've got to start on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7438)|
| 2:04:04| We've got to do the safety center first before we can even think about a pod down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7444)|
| 2:04:10| I'm glad to see that the state is on board with some funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7450)|
| 2:04:16| I hope that they will continue the case management because that's a vital point of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7456)|
| 2:04:22| because without case management, once they leave, they're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7462)|
| 2:04:27| I mean, they have nobody to watch after them, and a lot of them are homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7467)|
| 2:04:31| and they'll get out there, and they won't meet their appointments and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7471)|
| 2:04:36| But I think we need to think larger than 30 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7476)|
| 2:04:40| I think we need more than that, and I would support us moving with a safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7480)|
| 2:04:48| I think it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7488)|
| 2:04:50| Commissioner Broyle, is there a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7490)|
| 2:04:54| Here's the other piece of the equation that has me concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7494)|
| 2:04:59| and I've been a proponent of this from day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7499)|
| 2:05:02| I think the county's been dragging its heels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7502)|
| 2:05:04| It's time for us to own this and make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7504)|
| 2:05:07| It's going to end up saving us money and lives in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7507)|
| 2:05:10| But the other missing piece is that there are not enough beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7510)|
| 2:05:15| Once we get someone through the safety center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7515)|
| 2:05:19| the people who need to be inpatient somewhere, there are not enough beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7519)|
| 2:05:24| So what is in the works to complete that piece of the puzzle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7524)|
| 2:05:31| The housing component, of course, is where are you going to live once we've got you through the safety center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7531)|
| 2:05:36| and got you stabilized, where are you going to sleep at night is a huge piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7536)|
| 2:05:43| For those who are homeless, there are a lot of people who will go through who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7543)|
| 2:05:47| I want to point out, are not homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7547)|
| 2:05:51| And so we are talking with the experts, people that would run such a facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7551)|
| 2:05:57| what kind of beds can we get, where can we locate it, where could we put some beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7557)|
| 2:06:05| We've talked to a number of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7565)|
| 2:06:08| and we're talking quite frankly with a number of the churches to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7568)|
| 2:06:14| particularly with the Lutheran Church here that's nearby the mission there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7574)|
| 2:06:18| We've talked to Father Meisenheimer about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7578)|
| 2:06:21| They own all that property now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7581)|
| 2:06:23| Unless we launch these people into orbit, they have got to have some place to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7583)|
| 2:06:30| And we've got to plan on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7590)|
| 2:06:34| We worry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7594)|
| 2:06:36| That's why we've gone a little slower is because, as you point out, the problems we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7596)|
| 2:06:42| it seemed to us that all we're doing is we're just waiting for the failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7602)|
| 2:06:48| And the sheriff, he don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| He wants it to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7611)|
| 2:06:53| And that's what we're trying to get our ducks in a row on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7613)|
| 2:06:57| So when we do cut the ribbon, then we've got a reasonable feeling that this will work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7617)|
| 2:07:02| and we can continue to build on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7622)|
| 2:07:05| We're not there right now, though, because we're too short on places for people to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7625)|
| 2:07:10| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7630)|
| 2:07:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7632)|
| 2:07:13| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7633)|
| 2:07:14| Mr. Nichols, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7634)|
| 2:07:16| Always good to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7636)|
| 2:07:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7637)|
| 2:07:18| Two quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7638)|
| 2:07:20| There's about, what, 250 people at the detention center that qualify to be mentally ill, ballpark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7640)|
| 2:07:26| It would be much higher than that, I think, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7646)|
| 2:07:29| I suspect we're looking at probably 400 or so now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7649)|
| 2:07:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7652)|
| 2:07:34| This safety center would have how many beds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7654)|
| 2:07:38| Five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7658)|
| 2:07:41| Well, we've got to start somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7661)|
| 2:07:43| Got to start somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7663)|
| 2:07:44| And that's always bothered me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7664)|
| 2:07:46| Experts say when you talk with the people at Helen Ross McNabb, the turnover on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7666)|
| 2:07:50| we'll be able to handle a great number more people, of course, than the five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7670)|
| 2:07:54| And then we've got, like, 16 beds at the CSU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7674)|
| 2:07:57| And the turnover, they tell me, I can't explain it, Commissioner, because I don't understand it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7677)|
| 2:08:03| But they say, don't let that be the only worry that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7683)|
| 2:08:08| that this will accommodate a goodly number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7688)|
| 2:08:11| Now, we would want to expand sooner or later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7691)|
| 2:08:13| But presently, they say that let's get with this so we can do some business with this limited number now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7693)|
| 2:08:20| That's what the experts are telling us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7700)|
| 2:08:22| As much information as you can give me and I think all commissioners here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7702)|
| 2:08:25| we'd love to be as educated as possible so we can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7705)|
| 2:08:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7709)|
| 2:08:30| Commissioner Brown, you have the last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7710)|
| 2:08:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7712)|
| 2:08:33| Very, very, very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7713)|
| 2:08:35| Beforehand, we were told, again, as I mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7715)|
| 2:08:38| that a lot of these will qualify under either personal insurance or state insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7718)|
| 2:08:43| And Mr. Andy, at that time, who's retired from Helen Ross McNabb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7723)|
| 2:08:50| said that going through that program gives them an easier access into, it might be, what's the one over on the point, Randy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7730)|
| 2:09:02| Peninsula?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7742)|
| 2:09:05| Peninsula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7745)|
| 2:09:07| They will have a better chance of getting into Peninsula or one of these others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7747)|
| 2:09:12| than they're never going to get that chance out there in the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7752)|
| 2:09:16| But coming through here, and as Randy pointed out a minute ago, they can have a tremendous turnover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7756)|
| 2:09:22| It's not just, I mean, that's going to be the five most productive beds in all of East Tennessee, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7762)|
| 2:09:34| Thank you, General Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7774)|
| 2:09:36| Thank you, Sheriff Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7776)|
| 2:09:40| If there be no objection, the commission members who are members of the Fire Prevention Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7780)|
| 2:09:52| I will schedule a sunshine meeting that they meet and present a discussion item next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7792)|
| 2:10:04| Hearing no objection, we will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7804)|
| 2:10:10| No, we're not through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7810)|
| 2:10:11| We're not through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7811)|
| 2:10:12| We're not through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7812)|
| 2:10:13| Next discussion item is the appointment of citizen members to the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7813)|
| 2:10:21| At the last renewal or reappointment of a member to the Audit Committee, a citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7821)|
| 2:10:33| we were unable to go by the charter of the Audit Committee because we got no response from the vetting organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7833)|
| 2:10:44| If there be no objection, I will have introduced by resolution next month a resolution which will say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7844)|
| 2:10:54| if there is no vetting organization response within 90 days that the commission will then act on what would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7854)|
| 2:11:08| The Audit Commission would act on what would be appropriate to the seating of the citizen member of the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7868)|
| 2:11:17| Or who would be appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7877)|
| 2:11:19| I think it would be appropriate to have some qualifications that you don't want just any citizen sitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7879)|
| 2:11:26| I think coming from the accountant, being a CPA or something like that, have some kind of standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7886)|
| 2:11:32| The standard in place in the charter would remain there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7892)|
| 2:11:35| It would only be if the vetting committee, if the vetting organization does not offer a name within 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7895)|
| 2:11:44| then we can go about reappointing or we can search for a competent citizen member who has the qualification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7904)|
| 2:11:54| Now, that will be the resolution that will be before us next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7914)|
| 2:12:00| What's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7920)|
| 2:12:02| Okay. It is 6.55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7922)|
| 2:12:08| It is 6.55. At 7.10, we will come back for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7928)|
| 2:12:14| If there be no further business before commission for this month, meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7934)|
| 2:12:26| Thank you very much for your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7946)|
| 2:12:29| It's a few minutes late today, and I apologize to the audience here assembled that we commissioners run our two hours into two hours and ten, eleven minutes now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7949)|
| 2:12:43| This is the meeting of the Knox County commissioners to handle zoning request for the month of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7963)|
| 2:12:55| Madam Clerk, you'll call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7975)|
| 2:12:58| Commissioner McKenzie. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7978)|
| 2:13:00| Commissioner Brules. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7980)|
| 2:13:02| Commissioner Smith. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7982)|
| 2:13:04| Commissioner Wembe. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7984)|
| 2:13:05| Commissioner Schoonmaker. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7985)|
| 2:13:07| Commissioner Anders. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7987)|
| 2:13:08| Commissioner Bessler. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7988)|
| 2:13:10| Commissioner Wright. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7990)|
| 2:13:11| Commissioner Brown. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7991)|
| 2:13:13| Commissioner Thomas. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7993)|
| 2:13:14| Commissioner Brantley. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7994)|
| 2:13:18| Ten members present. That is a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=7998)|
| 2:13:21| We will look at the first item there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8001)|
| 2:13:26| If there be nothing else, we'll commence with the first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8006)|
| 2:13:29| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8009)|
| 2:13:30| 8-C-15-SP, request of Knox County Commission for a northwest county sector plan amendment from MDR, medium density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8010)|
| 2:13:39| to HDR, high density residential property located east side of Snyder Road, north side of Outlet Drive, in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8019)|
| 2:13:50| Thank you, Madam Clerk. Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8030)|
| 2:13:55| Mr. Chairman, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8035)|
| 2:14:02| I'm here with Mr. Gentry, who is the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8042)|
| 2:14:04| And I ask, is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8044)|
| 2:14:08| Seeing none, Mr. Seymour, you may continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8048)|
| 2:14:15| I have sent you all a packet of material that sort of hopefully explains how this whole thing got started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8055)|
| 2:14:25| Mr. Gentry has under contract property at the intersection of Outlet Drive and Snyder Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8065)|
| 2:14:34| It's zoned at 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8074)|
| 2:14:37| He thought that he would be able to acquire two or three acres, maybe four acres, from the landowner next door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8077)|
| 2:14:46| and would be able to build a 240-unit apartment building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8086)|
| 2:14:51| He has not been able to, and it's not for offering money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8091)|
| 2:14:55| I mean, the lady just will not sell the property that's been in her family for 100 years or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8095)|
| 2:15:01| and is not interested in selling, and that's her right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8101)|
| 2:15:05| Accordingly, we are asking for 18 units per acre, which is high-density residential under the county zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8105)|
| 2:15:15| There are several factors, I think, that mitigate in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8115)|
| 2:15:19| One, Knox County just spent $3.5 million to $4 million improving Outlet Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8119)|
| 2:15:29| It's one of the finest drives in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8129)|
| 2:15:32| It is underutilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8132)|
| 2:15:34| It parallels I-40 between Lovell Road and Campbell Station Road on the opposite side of Parkside Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8134)|
| 2:15:42| and the Turkey Creek commercial retail development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8142)|
| 2:15:51| Campbell Station Drive, or the exit from I-40 onto Campbell Station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8151)|
| 2:15:56| which was sort of a roadblock for a number of years, has recently been improved by TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8156)|
| 2:16:01| The exit works fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8161)|
| 2:16:04| Furthermore, there is a demand for apartments and high-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8164)|
| 2:16:11| especially in the western end of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8171)|
| 2:16:14| More and more people want to live in apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8174)|
| 2:16:17| Both people who may formerly have bought a house when they come out of college want to live in apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8177)|
| 2:16:25| and empty nesters want to live in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8185)|
| 2:16:28| Now, MPC staff says the high-density residential is not compliant with their policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8188)|
| 2:16:38| and the main policy they have been able to cite is that there is no public transit available to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8198)|
| 2:16:47| Well, Knox County does not have public transit available to any property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8207)|
| 2:16:51| so it would seem senseless to have a policy that would not allow high-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8211)|
| 2:16:58| yet the zoning ordinance allows high-density residential if you also approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8218)|
| 2:17:04| Frankly, public transit would probably not be needed out there in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8224)|
| 2:17:11| Minimum rents for a studio apartment would be $1,000 a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8231)|
| 2:17:16| and presumably anybody that can pay that can also afford an automobile or have somebody drive them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8236)|
| 2:17:23| So we think this is a unique situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8243)|
| 2:17:28| You are not setting any precedent that would compel you to zone any other property in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8248)|
| 2:17:38| the same way if it came before you because of the unique road structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8258)|
| 2:17:42| and there have been major changes in the road structure since the sector plan was last approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8262)|
| 2:17:50| Because of the demand for apartments in this area, this is a perfect place to locate high-density apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8270)|
| 2:17:59| Actually, you are under a mile by driving from Alex up to Campbell Station to the entrance to Turkey Creek Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8279)|
| 2:18:10| which is, I'm sure, the largest retail center in Knox County and the city of Knoxville and the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8290)|
| 2:18:20| There's another interesting thing that has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8300)|
| 2:18:22| The town of Farragut recently entered into a contract with the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8302)|
| 2:18:29| for a feasibility study on a connector over I-40 between Lovell Road and Campbell Station Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8309)|
| 2:18:37| that would connect outlets to Parkside Drive, increasing the connectivity between Turkey Creek shopping development and this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8317)|
| 2:18:50| So for all those reasons, we think this is a perfect opportunity to offer apartment living for people in that area of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8330)|
| 2:18:59| which is a very fast-growing area of town, and we have the infrastructure to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8339)|
| 2:19:06| Did you want to add anything, Mr. Gentry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8346)|
| 2:19:09| There was a question about whether we would access from Snyder Road or Alex Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8349)|
| 2:19:15| If Knox County Engineering will let us, after we perform a traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8355)|
| 2:19:20| which is required for a development of this type, when we go to use on review, we will go Alex Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8360)|
| 2:19:29| We have no interest in connecting into Snyder Road at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8369)|
| 2:19:32| The natural entrance to this property would be off Alex Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8372)|
| 2:19:40| Can I answer any other questions for you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8380)|
| 2:19:44| Commissioner Oindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8384)|
| 2:19:45| Real quick, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8385)|
| 2:19:49| Do we know where Knox County Engineering is on allowing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8389)|
| 2:19:53| Have they given an indication?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8393)|
| 2:19:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8396)|
| 2:19:57| Their initial response, and it would be the same, I think, for any development like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8397)|
| 2:20:03| you'll have to submit a traffic study, and we have not done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8403)|
| 2:20:08| It would be premature at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8408)|
| 2:20:15| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8415)|
| 2:20:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8416)|
| 2:20:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8417)|
| 2:20:18| I've got a few people calling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8418)|
| 2:20:20| I guess you've already addressed the Snyder Road, no access to Snyder Road issue that they brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8420)|
| 2:20:28| Another thing that I want to ask is do you have the right-of-way for that access to Parkside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8428)|
| 2:20:36| Alex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8436)|
| 2:20:37| Alex, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8437)|
| 2:20:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8438)|
| 2:20:39| You have that right-of-way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8439)|
| 2:20:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8440)|
| 2:20:41| Also, what kind of fencing, Mr. Gentry, I know you do great development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8441)|
| 2:20:45| but do you have fencing around your apartment complexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8445)|
| 2:20:47| or do you generally just let the buildings be the barriers and such?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8447)|
| 2:20:52| We put in some extensive landscaping and let that screen off the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8452)|
| 2:20:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8458)|
| 2:20:59| One thing I didn't mention is that the reason for 240 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8459)|
| 2:21:06| I think I said it out in one of my letters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8466)|
| 2:21:10| and I think you can see it from the elevations of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8470)|
| 2:21:15| to do an upscale development today you really need that number of units so you can do your amenities right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8475)|
| 2:21:24| your pool, your volleyball, your exercise room, your community room, your walking trails, and your dog park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8484)|
| 2:21:31| all of which are the minimum requirements for an upscale apartment complex today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8491)|
| 2:21:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8498)|
| 2:21:41| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8501)|
| 2:21:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8505)|
| 2:21:47| You know, since this was first brought up, I've gone back and forth on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8507)|
| 2:21:53| and I remember out at Drive when there was nothing there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8513)|
| 2:21:59| and then we were going to complete it all the way through, and it was going to be fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8519)|
| 2:22:05| It's going to be like Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8525)|
| 2:22:08| And if anything, we saw businesses fail over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8528)|
| 2:22:12| One of my friends had a business there that he left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8532)|
| 2:22:18| I'm very impressed with the packet that they sent that shows exactly what these will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8538)|
| 2:22:24| These are very upscale living places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8544)|
| 2:22:29| This is not your run-of-the-mill apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8549)|
| 2:22:35| I'm very impressed with the descriptions, oversized windows and so forth that were talked about in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8555)|
| 2:22:40| If you haven't seen it, you should see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8560)|
| 2:22:44| I think we need somebody to invest in that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8564)|
| 2:22:49| I mean, I see that bridge possibly coming over I-40, I-75 to split up those two exits, in between those two exits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8569)|
| 2:22:57| And people have told me this would be a dangerous NPC precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8577)|
| 2:23:01| because then everybody will come down and say, oh, I want the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8581)|
| 2:23:06| And I really believe that this one is so unusual and the road is so unusual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8586)|
| 2:23:11| that there's enough reason to show that this is a different situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8591)|
| 2:23:18| And I do think, I mean, I'm going to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8598)|
| 2:23:24| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8604)|
| 2:23:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8606)|
| 2:23:28| When this came up last time and we sent it back to NPC, I was against this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8608)|
| 2:23:33| But since that time, I've spent more time on Outlet Drive, and with the help that you've given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8613)|
| 2:23:39| I really think this is a great thing for Outlet Drive and for that part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8619)|
| 2:23:44| So to let you know, if everyone would build the amenities that you're building in this outfit, that's pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8624)|
| 2:23:51| So I'm for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8631)|
| 2:23:53| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8633)|
| 2:23:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8635)|
| 2:23:57| Comments are for Mr. Kelly, if he doesn't mind to come to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8637)|
| 2:24:00| as our representative of the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8640)|
| 2:24:08| Name and address for the record, please, Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8648)|
| 2:24:11| Dan Kelly, Metropolitan Planning Commission staff, 400 Main Street, suite 403.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8651)|
| 2:24:18| Thank you, Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8658)|
| 2:24:19| Do you believe that the NPC staff members denied the request for the high-density zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8659)|
| 2:24:28| solely on the mass transit issue of no buses going out to that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8668)|
| 2:24:35| Let me just tell you what I believe has happened since particularly this request has come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8675)|
| 2:24:41| We now have a new director, Mr. Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8681)|
| 2:24:44| and we have been discussing the potential for high-density residential in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8684)|
| 2:24:49| and based on the current policies that are in basically all the sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8689)|
| 2:24:54| it would be very difficult for the staff to support high-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8694)|
| 2:25:01| practically anywhere in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8701)|
| 2:25:04| I think from a policy standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8704)|
| 2:25:08| I think the staff is going to be looking at ways to be able to accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8708)|
| 2:25:15| high-density residential in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8715)|
| 2:25:18| and put forth potential policy changes in future sector plans which would allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8718)|
| 2:25:24| The current sector plans, as they're currently written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8724)|
| 2:25:27| based on the policies that are in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8727)|
| 2:25:30| makes it very difficult for the staff to recommend approval of high-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8730)|
| 2:25:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8737)|
| 2:25:38| When the county commission sent this item back to MPC and the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8738)|
| 2:25:44| why do you think the staff did not change their existing decision regarding this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8744)|
| 2:25:49| of no high-density residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8749)|
| 2:25:53| I guess you could say we're bullheaded, but no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8753)|
| 2:25:57| The policies, the plan is still there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8757)|
| 2:26:01| and I think from a staff standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8761)|
| 2:26:04| we make our recommendations based on the sector plans as adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8764)|
| 2:26:09| I think we're bound to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8769)|
| 2:26:12| The planning commission and this commission has a little more leeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8772)|
| 2:26:18| If you see, as Mr. Seymour pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8778)|
| 2:26:21| he sent forth an argument as to the rationale as to what's changed out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8781)|
| 2:26:26| that would allow you to make this sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8786)|
| 2:26:32| So from that standpoint, the matter when it came back to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8792)|
| 2:26:37| the staff, the plan was still the way it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8797)|
| 2:26:40| Staff made the same recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8800)|
| 2:26:42| The planning commission had three options when the matter came before it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8802)|
| 2:26:47| They could have adopted the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8807)|
| 2:26:50| as county commission proposed it in your amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8810)|
| 2:26:54| They could have supported or continued to recommend denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8814)|
| 2:26:58| Or the third option was to take no action at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8818)|
| 2:27:01| and that's basically what they did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8821)|
| 2:27:02| and they have sent it back to this commission saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8822)|
| 2:27:06| I believe the ball is in your court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8826)|
| 2:27:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8830)|
| 2:27:12| And then this is not directed for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8832)|
| 2:27:15| but I just want to make just a general comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8835)|
| 2:27:17| and I may be the only commissioner here that's against this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8837)|
| 2:27:21| because I believe that the MPC staff did their due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8841)|
| 2:27:24| and then the MPC commissioners did as well on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8844)|
| 2:27:28| Had the developer had the additional property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8848)|
| 2:27:31| I think the 18 units per acre would have been fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8851)|
| 2:27:34| I did have the opportunity on Friday morning to have a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8854)|
| 2:27:38| with one of the community relations people with TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8858)|
| 2:27:43| and they routinely do these feasibility studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8863)|
| 2:27:48| because they're required to under their funding status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8868)|
| 2:27:52| where if a city or municipality wants to put in 20 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8872)|
| 2:27:56| they'll put the balance in of 80 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8876)|
| 2:27:58| and they'll fund these feasibility studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8878)|
| 2:28:02| But in my opinion, based on that conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8882)|
| 2:28:06| I think that feasibility study is just going to end up on a shelf someplace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8886)|
| 2:28:09| and we'll never see an overpass over the interstate to Outlet Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8889)|
| 2:28:15| because TDOT has about $400 million worth of projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8895)|
| 2:28:18| and this will never be on the top ten projects that TDOT has to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8898)|
| 2:28:23| unless all of a sudden we just get some incredible amount of money here in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8903)|
| 2:28:28| So it's nice to bring that up about a feasibility study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8908)|
| 2:28:32| but that's not going to happen in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8912)|
| 2:28:35| And I just wanted to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8915)|
| 2:28:37| I mean, again, I'll probably be the only one voting against this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8917)|
| 2:28:41| but I just believe we should follow what the sector plan says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8921)|
| 2:28:44| and if Commissioner Anders is happy with it in his district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8924)|
| 2:28:49| and his people are behind it, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8929)|
| 2:28:52| The only other thing is you did have some opposition that may not be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8932)|
| 2:28:56| You saw some on your county e-mails today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8936)|
| 2:28:58| You also have the MPC filings that show opposition to this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8938)|
| 2:29:03| but we didn't post a sign to show that there was a meeting tonight on the property to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8943)|
| 2:29:10| And that's all I want to say, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8950)|
| 2:29:14| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8954)|
| 2:29:16| His slide was on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8956)|
| 2:29:22| Just kind of, and I've called a few of those people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8962)|
| 2:29:25| or the one that e-mailed today and I had a phone call today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8965)|
| 2:29:29| and their complaint is Schneider Road traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8969)|
| 2:29:33| and that this new request would be without accessing Schneider Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8973)|
| 2:29:39| And I think we built Outlet Drive for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8979)|
| 2:29:42| It was to spur development in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8982)|
| 2:29:45| and that's why you keep up with growth and to spur development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8985)|
| 2:29:49| And this is not an uncommon practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8989)|
| 2:29:52| We did Tazewell Pike, I believe we did 18 an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8992)|
| 2:29:55| It was already zoned for up to 18 an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8995)|
| 2:29:59| And then Emory Road, I believe we took to 19 an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=8999)|
| 2:30:02| So this is not uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9002)|
| 2:30:04| This is not an uncommon practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9004)|
| 2:30:05| This is just new to the county because the growth is in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9005)|
| 2:30:09| because the city's mostly built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9009)|
| 2:30:13| And so this is something that's coming our way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9013)|
| 2:30:16| It's not uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9016)|
| 2:30:17| And if we do it correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9017)|
| 2:30:18| which I think not accessing Schneider Road is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9018)|
| 2:30:23| because Schneider Road doesn't need the traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9023)|
| 2:30:25| but Outlet Drive sure can handle the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9025)|
| 2:30:27| So I'm going to make a motion to approve the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9027)|
| 2:30:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9031)|
| 2:30:34| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9034)|
| 2:30:37| I was just going to tell the rest of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9037)|
| 2:30:40| we had a plan come before you in my district out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9040)|
| 2:30:43| and the way the development was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9043)|
| 2:30:46| it fit in that particular place very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9046)|
| 2:30:51| And as the MPC staff looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9051)|
| 2:30:56| they said this would be the most logical place for that type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9056)|
| 2:31:01| And I think you have a similar situation in this section out here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9061)|
| 2:31:07| So I'm going to be in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9067)|
| 2:31:09| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9069)|
| 2:31:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9071)|
| 2:31:12| You know, this is right across the street from the Buddy Greg RVs and motorhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9072)|
| 2:31:17| It is not in basically a residential or subdivision area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9077)|
| 2:31:21| If it were, I would be against it, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9081)|
| 2:31:24| If it was a small two-lane road, I would be against it, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9084)|
| 2:31:28| But Outlet Drive is a new road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9088)|
| 2:31:31| It's a big road, and there's red lights on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9091)|
| 2:31:34| I mean, traffic flows very easily on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9094)|
| 2:31:37| I use it all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9097)|
| 2:31:38| And I think this would be a good addition for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9098)|
| 2:31:42| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9102)|
| 2:31:43| The motion that's before us, Commissioner Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9103)|
| 2:31:48| your motion is to approve the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9108)|
| 2:31:52| as presented by Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9112)|
| 2:31:55| From medium density to high density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9115)|
| 2:31:58| As presented by Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9118)|
| 2:32:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9120)|
| 2:32:02| And does the second agree with that wording?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9122)|
| 2:32:04| Mr. Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9124)|
| 2:32:06| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9126)|
| 2:32:09| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9129)|
| 2:32:12| Motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9132)|
| 2:32:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9133)|
| 2:32:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9135)|
| 2:32:16| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9136)|
| 2:32:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9137)|
| 2:32:19| Motion 1, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9139)|
| 2:32:20| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9140)|
| 2:32:23| The next item is associated with this, which is the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9143)|
| 2:32:26| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9146)|
| 2:32:30| 5-E-15-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9150)|
| 2:32:32| Request of first Knox Realty LLC for rezoning for PR plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9152)|
| 2:32:37| at up to 12 dwelling units per acre to PR plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9157)|
| 2:32:41| at a density up to 18 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9161)|
| 2:32:45| Refer back to MPC for reconsideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9165)|
| 2:32:47| Property located east side of Snyder Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9167)|
| 2:32:50| north side of Outlet Drive in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9170)|
| 2:32:55| I'd like to make a motion to approve pending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9175)|
| 2:32:57| or with the caveat that the traffic comes off of Parkside or Outlet Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9177)|
| 2:33:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9182)|
| 2:33:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9184)|
| 2:33:05| The applicant is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9185)|
| 2:33:08| You've heard this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9188)|
| 2:33:15| Could we make, let me ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9195)|
| 2:33:19| We don't want to come off Snyder Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9199)|
| 2:33:21| We're going to have to do a traffic study because of the density of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9201)|
| 2:33:27| If Knox County Engineering does not allow us to come off Outlet Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9207)|
| 2:33:38| and sometimes they'll require a second entrance that can be gated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9218)|
| 2:33:43| I think in this instance, Dan, would it be one entrance, do you think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9223)|
| 2:33:49| all that would be required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9229)|
| 2:33:50| Probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9230)|
| 2:33:52| We can do it subject to Knox County Engineering's approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9232)|
| 2:33:56| That's the only thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9236)|
| 2:33:57| We don't want to come off Snyder Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9237)|
| 2:34:01| It doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9241)|
| 2:34:02| What's the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9242)|
| 2:34:10| The caveat, I mean, that's the reason that we talked about, we sold Outlet Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9250)|
| 2:34:16| We talked about the developers okay with it coming off of Outlet Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9256)|
| 2:34:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9261)|
| 2:34:23| Subject to approval by Knox County Engineering, which I think we anticipate they will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9263)|
| 2:34:29| Do we not, Mr. Gentry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9269)|
| 2:34:31| They just will require a traffic study before they will approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9271)|
| 2:34:40| Go ahead, Commissioner Ornby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9280)|
| 2:34:42| I'm still thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9282)|
| 2:34:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9283)|
| 2:34:44| Commissioner Ornby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9284)|
| 2:34:46| I kind of understand what Arthur's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9286)|
| 2:34:49| I think steeplechase was done pretty much the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9289)|
| 2:34:53| The main entrance is off of Central, but they have a gated back closed gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9293)|
| 2:34:58| They do have another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9298)|
| 2:34:59| I forgot about that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9299)|
| 2:35:01| They're open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9301)|
| 2:35:02| But they do have a closed gate on that backside that's locked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9302)|
| 2:35:05| That was done for crime prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9305)|
| 2:35:06| That wasn't done for traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9306)|
| 2:35:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9307)|
| 2:35:08| I just knew it was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9308)|
| 2:35:11| Chairman Ryder, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9311)|
| 2:35:13| I think this brings up, I mean, I'm getting a little iffy now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9313)|
| 2:35:19| Because I don't want this thing to come out on the adjoining road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9319)|
| 2:35:24| We want it on Outlet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9324)|
| 2:35:25| And if they're not sure they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9325)|
| 2:35:31| Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9331)|
| 2:35:33| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9333)|
| 2:35:35| As I understand Commissioner Anders' motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9335)|
| 2:35:40| it would be to recommend approval subject to one condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9340)|
| 2:35:43| and that condition would be access to Outlet Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9343)|
| 2:35:49| At this point, we haven't seen a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9349)|
| 2:35:55| All property looks flat on a piece of paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9355)|
| 2:35:57| and I have no idea if that's the appropriate location to have access or not to have access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9357)|
| 2:36:05| I don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9365)|
| 2:36:07| This project will have to go through the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9367)|
| 2:36:11| And access, as Mr. Seymour said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9371)|
| 2:36:15| they will be required to produce a traffic impact study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9375)|
| 2:36:20| which will go through the analysis of the traffic they're going to generate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9380)|
| 2:36:26| as well as the traffic that is on the surrounding roads, both Snyder and Outlet Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9386)|
| 2:36:32| If there is a need for left turn lanes or any other improvements right there at the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9392)|
| 2:36:38| the developer would be on the hook to do that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9398)|
| 2:36:41| But at this point, you've got two ways you can deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9401)|
| 2:36:45| One is you can pass a motion right now saying that access is to Outlet Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9405)|
| 2:36:50| and I believe you give Mr. Gentry's marching orders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9410)|
| 2:36:54| or you can just pass it as is, you know, as recommended without the condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9414)|
| 2:37:02| and it can be a topic of discussion through the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9422)|
| 2:37:09| We will be happy with the motion as Mr. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9429)|
| 2:37:12| You're good with the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9432)|
| 2:37:13| All right, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9433)|
| 2:37:15| Mr. Gentry is very calm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9435)|
| 2:37:18| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9438)|
| 2:37:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9439)|
| 2:37:20| This is properly before us, but we've got to narrow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9440)|
| 2:37:25| We have one condition, which is entrance and exit only on Outlet Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9445)|
| 2:37:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9450)|
| 2:37:31| And the question for the law director is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9451)|
| 2:37:34| is this a rezoning as recommended by MPC or as recommended by County Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9454)|
| 2:37:50| This is a motion to approve a rezoning subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9470)|
| 2:37:56| I am not of the opinion that this would need to go back before Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9476)|
| 2:38:02| because this isn't the sort of substantial change that you would need to have a full reconsideration of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9482)|
| 2:38:13| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9493)|
| 2:38:16| So the question before us is, on the 18 dwelling units per acre, is commission, not MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9496)|
| 2:38:30| They only recommended 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9510)|
| 2:38:34| Because MPC only recommended 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9514)|
| 2:38:38| Well, the requirement for rezoning is that it be submitted to the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9518)|
| 2:38:46| and they did consider the rezoning request as requested by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9526)|
| 2:38:56| 18 units per acre was the request that the applicant made to the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9536)|
| 2:39:01| which necessitated the plan amendment and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9541)|
| 2:39:04| So the Planning Commission has considered 18 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9544)|
| 2:39:07| and I believe the matter is properly before you, you have that option to approve it as per the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9547)|
| 2:39:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9553)|

| 2:40:43| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9643)|
| 2:40:45| I'm Brian Chase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9645)|
| 2:40:46| I reside at the subject property of 8153 Pellix Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9646)|
| 2:40:50| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9650)|
| 2:40:54| What's the pleasure of commission, Commissioner Bessler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9654)|
| 2:40:58| Before we do anything, why are you going from residential to agricultural?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9658)|
| 2:41:04| Well, several years ago I acquired this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9664)|
| 2:41:07| and we had it rezoned from low-density residential to agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9667)|
| 2:41:12| so we could put some chickens on it because I live out in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9672)|
| 2:41:16| and there's, like, nobody around for 1,000 feet or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9676)|
| 2:41:20| Cow fields and trees is about all I have for neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9680)|
| 2:41:25| And we recently acquired an additional acre from the neighbor's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9685)|
| 2:41:31| and so that resulted in a split zoning because it was just a redefinition of the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9691)|
| 2:41:37| So now I have one acre that's zoned low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9697)|
| 2:41:41| and one acre that's agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9701)|
| 2:41:43| and I want to get rid of the split zoning and just make it all agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9703)|
| 2:41:46| so I can maintain my chicken coop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=9706)|
