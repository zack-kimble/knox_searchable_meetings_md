| 0:17:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| Next item is item 10A, an appeal by Amy Leslie for the South Haven Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1028)|
| 0:17:16| of the Board of Zoning Appeals' decision to approve a variance to reduce Gilbert Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1036)|

| 0:17:37| It's first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1057)|
| 0:17:39| Sorry, I missed that at the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| Make a motion to postpone that for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| Both sides have requested it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| Also, 11G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| And 11G is a companion, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| So the motion is for 10A and 11G to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| You said both sides have requested it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| Is that what I heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| There was a second by Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| The funny thing is Councilman Roddy nudged me and said, we're finally going to get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| And I said, no, he just forgot to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| All those in favor of postponing 10A and 11G, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| Next item is 11C, a resolution authorizing the filing of an amendment to the Certificate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1104)|
| 0:18:31| of Incorporation of the Public Building Authority of the County of Knox and the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| Tennessee, to authorize action by written consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| I just had a question, a serious one, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| What are some examples of things that would be done if this passes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| Their council is here, I think, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| Do you want to address that, Mr. Slatery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1133)|
| 0:18:59| Give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| I'm Herbert Slatery, 6822 Crystal View Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| Councilman Frost, really what this is trying to do is we have some difficulty getting a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| quorum certain periods during the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| And this allows the PBA to, I think, provide a better service to both the county and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| And I'll give you, for instance, if we've got a contract that the city won't sign and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| it has some urgency to it, we'd rather not wait another month if we don't have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| And what we can do if you pass this is it allows us to contact a director who's available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1168)|
| 0:19:35| and out of town but to sign a written consent as opposed to being actually present at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| And just a further explanation, our bylaws authorize this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| Our charter does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| And hence, we have to get your approval to amend the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| That's why we're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| You mentioned that this would be done kind of like on an emergency basis, not as a matter of just course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| It would be an exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| It's just some flexibility to allow us to better serve you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1210)|

| 0:20:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| Next item is 11-D, a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an amendment with to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1218)|

| 0:20:44| annual cost of $121,074.07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| Questions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| No, I'd just actually say I think that site is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| And so I think it's wonderful that that's going to be opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1259)|

| 0:22:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| We can move one out of your district over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| Make sure all parts are treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| Next item is 11E, a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a quick claim deed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1363)|
| 0:22:49| Knoxville Preservation and Development LLC for one parcel of property located at 1424| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1369)|
| 0:22:55| Neilia Avenue, CLT number 081L-R-033 within the city limits of the city of Knoxville pursuant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1375)|
| 0:23:04| to the homemaker program for a contract sales price of $100 requested by Department of Finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| and Accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| This may be good to get a quick explanation on the record for the citizens at home when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| they kind of hear a piece of property for that amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| And then I think also, we've got this thing in the process, but I'd like to encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1403)|
| 0:23:30| the department that, and maybe you did it this time, in the future, when we've got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| project like this in the homemaker's program that looks like it's not moving, that maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| we make it a part of what we do to try and contact some of the nonprofits out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| like Knoxville Leadership Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| I mentioned that to Director Reherl today, and maybe it was done this time, or Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| Commerce Development Center, or some of those kind of folk who do some things in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| to see if they're interested in picking up on a piece of property like this for maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| a little better price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| But maybe just to give us a quick explanation on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| Thank you, Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| And I did follow up and ask some more questions after our conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| And I was told by the manager of our homemaker program that, in fact, she showed this house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1447)|
| 0:24:15| to numerous individuals and organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| And our CHOTOs, such as you mentioned, were aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| Nobody was interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| I think, finally, there were two applications that were received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| And when they get an application, they have to review and see who can most likely carry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| out the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| And so the applicant that was picked was Mr. Hsu, Daniel Hsu, who has done numerous properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1473)|
| 0:24:40| already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| He's active in the Old North Knoxville Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| And is well regarded for the work that he's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| If anybody had a chance to drive by that property, there are several houses on the street that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| have already been rehabbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| This house is just an eyesore right between two of them in particular that look very nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| Again, it's one of those tragedies waiting to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| This is a building that's a house that's been vacant for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| It's boarded up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| If it caught fire or something happened, the houses, these are very narrow lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| It would certainly destroy a lot of really good work that's been done in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1515)|
| 0:25:21| So considering the fact that there was no other takers for this in the private or non-profit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1521)|
| 0:25:28| sector in order to make this project work money-wise and to end up having a moderately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| priced home, since this is for low-to-mod income folks, then we felt that we needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1534)|
| 0:25:42| to accept this particular offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| I'm glad to hear that we do reach out to the CHOTOs in the area and those other organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| when we have opportunities like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| And the low-mod definition, which definition are they using, the HUD definition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| It would be the HUD definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| Mr. Hsu is here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| I saw Mr. Hsu here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| I just want to make sure that we shop stuff like this around to the CHOTOs, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| Seeing no further questions, you're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| 11F is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute and deliver an agreement with 320| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1579)|

| 0:26:30| police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| It's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| Questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| 12G is a resolution approving NLP – whoops, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| We already postponed that for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| 11H, a resolution adopting the Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue Corridor Plan, requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| by Division of Community Development, 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| Questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| I wanted to ask, I guess, the administration, and it might be community development, about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| implementation plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| I mean, there's a lot of good recommendations for actions in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| Just sort of what's already started, what's going to be in the common budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| I think it's important to – this is a great plan and to make sure that we actually get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| as much of it done as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| Thank you, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| Actually, quite a few things have already started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| I can just list a few of them based on this page one where it has the summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| And Vice Mayor Brown has served on the Steering Committee, I understand, for this, so he could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| probably add to this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| Under number one, the Five Points commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| These are the priorities that have been set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| Implementing a facade improvement program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| There are already two projects that have been completed, a restaurant on – a restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| and the Hardy Buildings there in the Five Points area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| The Park City banners have been installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| And some plant – some street trees have already been planted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| In the Burlington area, the facade program is now available and we're close to signing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| the first agreement on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| And the banners have also been installed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| In Union Square Park, actually we're told that Parks and Recreation will be submitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1688)|
| 0:28:14| a request for CDBG funds to start the development of that park, per the recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1694)|
| 0:28:22| Under the South Chestnut Street priority, there was – one of the issues is to rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1702)|
| 0:28:29| from commercial to low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| And some of the sites where the city has control, we have already implemented that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1712)|
| 0:28:39| Under the South Chestnut Green, the design center has already developed the concept design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| for that, so that's the first step in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| Under the traffic calming, the plan is complete for traffic calming and we'll need to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| with the service department to see about implementing that and see what type of schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| And, of course, with the Walter P. Taylor Homes, that would be KCDC and I actually can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| tell you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| So that's just some of the steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| This is a plan that's had – if you look at the steering committee, a lot of the different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| departments from the city were there as well as some folks in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| And there was quite a bit of public process involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| And one of the goals is to – one of the policies is to keep the steering committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| And I'm meeting with Vice Mayor Brown, I think on Thursday it is, and that'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| one of our topics of conversation is pulling this committee back together and making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| that we follow through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| One thing I want to commend the city, Parks and Rec, also on already that they did with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| regards to Union Square Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| We went in already and took out those basketball goals and did some things there to begin to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| make it more of a passive park and a family-friendly park, which is already cut down on some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| the folk hanging around, just doing some things that maybe they shouldn't be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1790)|
| 0:29:56| And we're already beginning with just some measures of that nature to begin to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| the character and the culture around that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| And hopefully we continue forward with some of the housing things with KCDC support out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| there and some of the city things that we'll have a whole change out there as it relates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| to that whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1812)|

| 0:30:15| I drove out this afternoon to Union Square Park, and I read the section in there where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| it said take out the basketball goal, and I'm there, there's no basketball court here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1818)|

| 0:31:05| Fulton Order of Police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| And I just want to say I believe this year has started out great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| We met with the mayor yesterday with our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| The intent of the bonus system we endorse wholeheartedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| However, the means or the criteria that or perception, I'll put it, of the criteria that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1880)|
| 0:31:29| is being taken by the membership, I think inroads are being made to rectify that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1889)|
| 0:31:36| probably going to take more of a defining moments to explain to membership and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1896)|
| 0:31:43| And I talked to Chief Owen and some others, and I think we're all starting on the right foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| But we do endorse putting money back in the bonus system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| But we want to see, make sure that everyone is on the right sheet of music and understands wholeheartedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1912)|
| 0:32:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1920)|

| 0:32:05| I know you said you've talked to the chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| Has this been a sit-down discussion, or is that going to happen down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| After speaking to the mayor yesterday, I spoke briefly with Chief Owen this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1931)|
| 0:32:18| And there's going to be things that work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| We're not far apart by no means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1940)|

| 0:32:45| Can't you help us out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1965)|

| 0:32:51| He's tied up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1974)|

| 0:33:05| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1987)|

| 0:33:11| Ordinance 12-D, an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| Appendix B, Zoning Regulations, Articles 3 and 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=1995)|

| 0:33:25| adding the South Waterfront Form-Based Development Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| and amending the City of Knoxville Zoning Map by creating a map inset for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2009)|

| 0:33:38| Development First District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| Just for a point of clarification here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| what is coming before us is as amended by the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| So those speaking in favor of it are those who are in favor of the plan as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| amended by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| Those against are against the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| Hold on one second, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| If you notice, we had a change of lawyers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| Mr. Kaiser didn't leave for the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| Ms. Poplin has been the person who's been in charge of the form-based code for the legal department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| and is the one who is up to speed on all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| So we'll be addressing the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| I want to make a motion to approve but to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2058)|
| 0:34:24| First, you have a motion to approve and then a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| But I'll start with a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| I have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| Just so I can explain it to the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| we do have quite a few folks who are signed up to speak on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| three speaking in favor of it as it was amended out of MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| and several speaking against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| And I'm guessing eight or nine at a rough call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| So I just want to let council know the status of the people who want to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| So there's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| Actually, I did hear a second from Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| A second from Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| I want to make sure I have all this straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| There's a motion to approve and then he's going to come back later with a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2102)|
| 0:35:09| I'm going to come back now with a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| Now that it's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| Now you can amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| I want to make a motion to amend it to keep in two of the amendments that MPC approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2115)|
| 0:35:25| those amendments being, make sure I can get this correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| one has to do with the street tree planning requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2129)|
| 0:35:42| That would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| Here, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| It's amendment four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| If you, it's not four, it's number five in the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2154)|
| 0:36:02| Which thing are you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| We have a bunch of documents here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| 12D staff report, it's page three of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2167)|
| 0:36:14| Under recommendation, if you look at number five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2174)|
| 0:36:20| street tree planning requirements for all districts should be changed to the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| A, one tree, minimum two-inch caliper is required for every five parking spaces to be planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2186)|
| 0:36:32| and required islands and medians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| B, required for surface parking, trees required for surface parking, I think it should say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| may be counted against the minimum of eight trees, minimum two-inch caliper per acre open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2200)|
| 0:36:48| I do not want to delete that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| I want to include that amendment in the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| Number five, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| Yes, number five in the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| The other item would be on the road number one under recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2221)|
| 0:37:14| The regulating plan should be changed by adding language that indicates that the actual location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| and configuration of new streets shown as flexible road alignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| will be determined at the time of redevelopment of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| I want to include that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| The other three amendments I want to remove, and this is my amendment of the amended version,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2248)|
| 0:37:35| going back to the original ordinances that came out of the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2255)|
| 0:37:43| and the oversight committee's input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| In other words, we would remove number two in that section under recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| The minimum width of the river buffer setback in the SW4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| and SW7 districts should be changed from 70 feet to 60 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2275)|
| 0:38:01| Remove that amendment so that it stays at 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| Number three, it says the maximum building height in the SW7 district should be changed from 50 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2284)|
| 0:38:11| and four-story maximum plus an additional one-story maximum with 10 feet setback to 100 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| and nine-story maximum plus additional two-story maximum with 10-foot wall setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| That is the amendment that MPC approved, and my amendment would remove that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| So we'd go back to the original language on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| which would be 50 feet and four-story plus an additional one-story maximum with 10-foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2312)|
| 0:38:40| And the other part of my amendment would be to delete number four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| or remove number four amendment, which says the maximum building height in the SW4 district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2326)|
| 0:38:52| should be changed from 50 feet and four-story maximum plus an additional one-story maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2332)|
| 0:38:58| with 10-foot setback to 70 feet and six-story maximum plus an additional two-story maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| with 10-foot wall setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| By amending it back, it would change it to read the maximum building height in the SW4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2347)|
| 0:39:12| should be changed from 50 – no, will be 50 feet and a four-story maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2352)|
| 0:39:19| plus an additional one-story maximum with 10-foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| That's the original language, and it would be amended back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| Just to put that in plain, just so everybody understands what we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| what we're doing is what the motion to amend is is to take back the changes that MPC made in the river buffer setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2374)|
| 0:39:41| and in building heights and setbacks in SW7 and building heights and setbacks in SW4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2381)|
| 0:39:48| to leave in the tree planting requirement changes and the language relative to the flexible road alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2388)|
| 0:39:56| So just everybody is straight with where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| Mr. Becker, would you like to talk now before folks speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| Well, I was actually just going to say I hope that we can be flexible about people's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| I know there are more people signed up than the rules allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| I'd be inclined to make a motion to hear everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| but I'd also sort of like to ask folks to be cautious of how long this meeting is going to be as you're speaking at us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| and especially to not get too confused about who's pro and against because at some level these get very confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2419)|
| 0:40:25| I think I will try to straighten that out before we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| I guess the question Mr. Becker just brought up is the one before council now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| There's eight people signed up to speak formally against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| I now think we are in favor of the amended motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| Just making sure I'm still right, everybody here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| It's possible that somebody might actually be against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| Why are you asking our secretary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| He's also a judge and a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2448)|
| 0:40:54| So the question before council is, do you want to amend your rules to hear all eight of those speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2454)|
| 0:41:00| and ask them to be short and to the point and not to repeat each other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| Or would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| There's a move and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| Any questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| All those in favor of changing the rules to allow eight to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2470)|
| 0:41:16| And we will ask them to keep time in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| All those in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| Excuse me, Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| Just one question, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| We've done this in the past, even though the numbers aren't correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| We've tended to try to allow some additional time for whichever the other side is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| I think that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| And with council's permission as chair, I will allow the side, which I guess is being represented by Mr. Seymour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2490)|
| 0:41:36| to have some extra time, again, with the request that he be reasonable in the use of that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| But if he needs extra time, that we would grant that just to keep it in balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| With council's permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| All those in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| All those in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| I guess now we're going to hear from those who signed up to speak against but who I'm now assuming are speaking in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2515)|
| 0:42:00| Have I got it right, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| I think so, if that's what their position is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| Those, I'm going to go ahead and call those names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| And if you'd kind of come and be ready to go next, first is Kelvin Francis, then Monty Stanley, then Mary English,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2529)|
| 0:42:15| and I'll try to keep people coming right after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| So Kelvin Francis is the first name that has signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| Yeah, my name is Kelvin Francis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| I live at 205 Maple Loop Road in South Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| I believe you are right that we are in agreeance with the amendments that Joe just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2548)|
| 0:42:35| I'm here representing the members of South Knoxville Baptist Church over in the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2555)|
| 0:42:42| We've been there for 118 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| We've seen this South Waterfront grow through the years and decline, and we would love to see it grow back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2564)|
| 0:42:54| We're there to support it and its implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| Thank you, and thank you for being brief as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| Mr. Stanley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| My name is Monty Stanley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| I live at 3029 Davenport Road in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| I guess I'm going to speak now in support of the revised version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2591)|
| 0:43:16| But South Knoxville has waited patiently for many years for a vision plan to see this large area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2596)|
| 0:43:24| of underutilized property be redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| The adoption of the form-based codes will be the main tool used for making this vision a reality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2608)|
| 0:43:35| while allowing for a greater certainty in the future growth patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| The process used to achieve this plan was very open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2619)|
| 0:43:44| Four neighborhood organizations, city officials, stakeholders, businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2624)|
| 0:43:50| and other community members worked diligently for over 19 months to reach this consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2630)|
| 0:43:57| The new urban design concepts incorporated in this plan will add a new dynamic to the redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2637)|
| 0:44:04| and will be a progressive example for other cities to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| I urge you to pass the form-based codes for the South Waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| and help Knoxville realize its potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| And as Mary's coming, Rob Dantzrow and Jenny Arthur will follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| My name is Mary English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| I live at 810 Oak Grove Lane, Knoxville 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| That's in the Bearden area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| I have had the privilege of serving on the South Waterfront Oversight Committee partly because I'm a rower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2676)|
| 0:44:43| I actually sit in the middle of the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| And as such, I need to say I love this river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| It is beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| It's changeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| I particularly love the views of the hills beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| And the other thing to note about the river is it's free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| No one owns it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| For this reason, I urge you to support the code as it has been proposed tonight and amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2701)|
| 0:45:09| It provides for the enjoyment not only of those on the river| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| but also of the South Knoxville community to continue to experience the river from the shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2713)|
| 0:45:20| just as those on the North Shore can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| So thank you very much for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| Thank you, Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| Rob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| Rob Dancerow, 1302 White Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| When this process started, I did live in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| I still own property in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| I was appointed to the Mayor's Advisory Committee to look at the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| And I think I received a phone call in July of 2005, and we're just now here talking about approving it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2744)|
| 0:45:52| We've seen several extensions of the contract for the consultants at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2752)|
| 0:45:57| And I'm not going to get into the nuts and bolts of what's going on with the vision plan or the action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2757)|
| 0:46:03| I think council is aware of everything that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| I think Mr. Woodhull referred to the need for continuing education credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| if he had to hear anything else about form-based codes at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2770)|
| 0:46:16| And I think we're all in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| I think this has been a very good process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| and I think that everybody has become educated as to what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| And I think that, you know, we're dealing with a community on the front end in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| that could have been in another country instead of, you know, just across the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| And, you know, we've got this group of people that are together, and they went through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| and they believed in it, and, you know, they believe in the product as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| And I think these amendments that Mr. Holquist has asked for tonight are reasonable amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| but I think that the dramatic changes that were implemented by MPC are out of line at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2808)|
| 0:46:55| based on the fact that we went through a process that was so open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| And I feel like we should approve it, or you should, the way that it's been amended now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| with those two additional amendments that Mr. Holquist recommended from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| And we should move forward with this and actually get some things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| I think this process has gone on for so long that a lot of the community might have even lost faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| into whether or not anything's actually going to happen at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| And let's give them the development that they asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| So many people participated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| Don't forget about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2843)|
| 0:47:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| Jenny Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| And after Jenny, excuse me, Rachel Craig and Mike Roddicker and then Diana Kahn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| I'm Jenny Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| I live at 705 Phillips Avenue, right in the middle of the redevelopment district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| I'm a member of the Mayor's Oversight Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| And I, too, thought it was a great process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| It was such a great process that people couldn't believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| They would leave these meetings and say, this seems really good, like they were puzzled, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| And we would go report that to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| Yeah, it's going really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| It's a great process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| And they would say, oh, there must be something coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| You know, you're just being used to create the illusion of public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| And we would be on guard for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| And every time, you know, we'd look and say, no, I think it really is a great process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2883)|
| 0:48:07| And so I have a great deal of faith in the plan that we came up with and in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2887)|
| 0:48:12| And one of the main things that emerged from that process was that the public wants green space down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2892)|
| 0:48:20| The river buffer setbacks have already been compromised on as part of this legitimate process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| We started at 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| We went down to 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| We went down to 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| And at the MPC, they gave, you know, another 10 feet off of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| And to me, 70 was already a really strong compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| And to do so further would destroy the integrity of a process that was based on compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2921)|
| 0:48:47| I think if you the river buffer is a defining element of the whole project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2927)|
| 0:48:53| And if it doesn't look like anything, it's really going to impact how the waterfront feels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2933)|
| 0:49:00| It will reduce the ability for us to have mature trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| You know, if you're thinking long term, we need some space there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| And the spillout from restaurants and cafes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| Just think about Gay Street, how there are these restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| And, you know, they put a couple of tables out on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| And it's really crowded, but those tables are always full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| And, you know, Market Square at Tomato Head and so forth, there are a few tables, but they're always full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| And you think, gee, wouldn't it be great if there were more space for those tables?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| Well, that's what we have the opportunity to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| If we leave enough room, there can be this vibrant, dynamic community feel to that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2968)|
| 0:49:36| But if we restrict it, all that's going to have to go inside if it's there at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2976)|
| 0:49:41| And it will be lost forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| There are also some technical problems with further nibbling away at the river buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2983)|
| 0:49:51| You'll run into KUB easement problems and even handicapped accessibility to marinas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2991)|
| 0:49:58| We don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| So I'm asking you to support the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| It was one of the best processes I've ever been a part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| I thought Dave Hill was a fantastic facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| And I think if you do, the public will have confidence that we really can have great public spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| and we really can have a real city that people would actually want to visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3016)|
| 0:50:21| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| Rachel Craig and then Mike Roddicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| Rachel Craig, 2222 Island Home Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| Before I start, I'd like to ask everybody who is here in support of passing the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| as with the amendments suggested by Councilman Hawk was to stand up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3039)|
| 0:50:50| I, too, think this has been an extraordinary process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| And the fact that we are at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| and we really only have two outstanding issues on the table is amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3056)|
| 0:51:01| You're looking at this very lengthy and complicated code and we're down to two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3061)|
| 0:51:07| I think that's a real testament to how well the process worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| and it's a testament to everybody who participated in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| However, we do have these two issues still outstanding, the river buffer and the building heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| Jenny spoke to the river buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| I want to concentrate on building heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| Very briefly how we got here, I'll try not to throw out too many numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| The code that was sent to MPC by the city with the concurrence of the oversight committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3089)|
| 0:51:35| which is the same code Joe is suggesting you approve this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3095)|
| 0:51:41| recommended maximum building heights of 70 feet in the SW4 and 60 feet in the SW5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3101)|
| 0:51:48| The property owners represented by Mr. Seymour requested 100 feet in the SW4 and 150 feet in the SW7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3108)|
| 0:51:57| MPC ended up approving 90 feet in the SW4 and 120 feet in the SW7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3117)|
| 0:52:05| I think MPC was trying to act in a spirit of compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| but in this case it just doesn't work very well to say they've got a number, we've got a number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3129)|
| 0:52:15| let's look for something in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| That's because the numbers that were in the code that went to MPC aren't arbitrary numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3137)|
| 0:52:24| They were based on the objectives of the vision plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| which was put together by a lot of members of this community and adopted by this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3147)|
| 0:52:34| On the one hand, the vision plan wants to promote urban density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| and it certainly wants to make development economically attractive and feasible for property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3157)|
| 0:52:44| So that argues for taller buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| On the other hand, we don't want buildings to be so large that they overwhelm their surroundings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| especially around the neighborhoods and around public places like the proposed bell tower walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| And we also want to preserve view sheds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| and that's not just the views from the south side of the river to the water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| it's also the views from this side of the river looking over those new buildings to Fort Dickerson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| and the ridges on the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3191)|
| 0:53:14| The consultants showed us diagrams that indicated that if we went higher with these buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3194)|
| 0:53:21| than what the oversight committee ended up recommending, we would significantly impact those views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3201)|
| 0:53:27| I think it's also important to take note of how building heights are measured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| They're not measured from the foundation of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| They're measured from the average elevation along the principal frontage road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3215)|
| 0:53:40| So if you have a building that sits here and the frontage road is up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| the building height measurement isn't taken from down here, it's taken from the frontage road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| And in some cases, like the Holston Gases property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| where you've got a significant elevation change between the property down along the river| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3233)|
| 0:53:58| and the principal frontage road up at Council Place, that can really come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| So the 120 feet that MPC approved, it's not 120 feet from down here along the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3242)|
| 0:54:08| it's 120 feet from up here at Council Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| I also want to take just a minute to mention that the code has safeguards built into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| There is an alternative compliance review where if a developer or property owner who has a project that looks like a good project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3257)|
| 0:54:27| but it doesn't meet the code, for example, it proposes higher buildings than the code allows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3267)|
| 0:54:33| they can go through this process, which requires going through MPC and getting more intensive review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3273)|
| 0:54:40| But that avenue is open to them, and if they have a good project, it's very likely to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| The code also contains a provision for annual review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3286)|
| 0:54:51| which means if we come up in two or three years and it's obvious that we've written these codes to be too restrictive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3291)|
| 0:54:58| and the market is not responding, we can fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| Finally, and I know you're tired of listening to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| I think it's really important that the disagreement on these two issues not get framed as neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3306)|
| 0:55:12| versus property owners, because that's not really what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| The city, the consultants, and the oversight committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| which was made up of representatives from numerous stakeholder groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| worked to balance all stakeholder interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| In doing so, we sought and used extensive public input, and we were guided by the goals of the vision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3327)|
| 0:55:34| I've heard the mayor say a couple of times that in government sometimes process is as important as product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3334)|
| 0:55:42| In this case, I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| The product is important, but so is the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| I want to thank you all for your support of the process so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| It's been great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| And I urge you to please continue to support the process, its product, and all the people who participated in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3352)|
| 0:55:59| Please approve the form-based code, but with the amendments that Councilman Holquist has suggested tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3359)|
| 0:56:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| Mike Rodaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3368)|
| 0:56:14| My name is Mike Rodaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| I live at 1112 Stevens Avenue, and I'm the vice president of the South Haven Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| I'm here to express my support for the vision plan as it was amended by Mr. Holquist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3382)|
| 0:56:28| and also to say that I've heard from many of my neighbors that they also support it in that form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3388)|
| 0:56:37| And really the only negative feedback I've heard about this plan is all based on the fear that it won't move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3397)|
| 0:56:47| as it was originally laid out in the original vision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3407)|
| 0:56:51| And I think the city has done a lot to kind of include everybody in this process so that that was held to a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3411)|
| 0:57:00| And I just wanted to share a couple of comments that I heard from people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3420)|
| 0:57:08| One was in the beginning of this process I had asked a friend if they had been going to these meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| and if they had, you know, been involved in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| And her comment was that she didn't want to get involved because she was afraid of being disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3437)|
| 0:57:24| And I think in the beginning of this process that was a very real fear of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| And given what's come up now, I think it's beginning to be a fear again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| although this may seem like, you know, small changes to a much larger plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3453)|
| 0:57:42| The other comment that I wanted to bring up was that I was talking to a UT architectural student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3462)|
| 0:57:48| that doesn't live in South Knoxville and kind of asked him what he planned to do when he got out of school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3468)|
| 0:57:54| where he planned to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| And his thoughts were that to really get with a good firm, he needed to go to a larger city, possibly New York, possibly Chicago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3475)|
| 0:58:05| And the one thing that came out of that conversation, and I didn't bring it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| was that if the South Waterfront offered something intriguing and interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3489)|
| 0:58:14| that was something that could keep him in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| And I thought that was very telling of the power that this development might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3498)|
| 0:58:25| I bring these things up to let you know that there's people all over the city that are waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3505)|
| 0:58:31| and hoping that the South Waterfront will be a unique, pedestrian-friendly place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3511)|
| 0:58:36| and quite frankly something that will continue to allow us to say that we're proud to live in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3516)|
| 0:58:43| I don't think that these changes in themselves are going to be anything that would cause people to not be proud of where they live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3523)|
| 0:58:52| But I do believe that it's enough to start to shake the confidence of people in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3532)|
| 0:58:59| And the city has worked extremely hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| Everybody's worked extremely hard to gain that confidence and to bring everybody along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3542)|
| 0:59:08| And I feel like that's why it's so important that we don't allow these changes in the way that they were brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3548)|
| 0:59:19| and that we stick to the public process that was gone through to get to where we were at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3559)|
| 0:59:29| I just want to thank you for giving us a chance to be part of this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| and for your continued foresight on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3577)|
| 0:59:38| Diana Kahn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| My name is Diana Kahn, 704 Hickman Street, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3582)|
| 0:59:50| This has been a long, open, public process that hundreds of people have taken part in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3590)|
| 1:00:00| This has been hammered out and people have agreed to compromises and discussed and worked things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3600)|
| 1:00:09| I have neighbors who still aren't 100% satisfied with what the foreign-based code says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3609)|
| 1:00:16| but I believe that we can work out the problems we have within the structure of the code as it's proposed by Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3616)|
| 1:00:26| And I would like to urge you to please respect this process that we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3626)|
| 1:00:32| and approve the code as amended by Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| Thank you to those folks who are speaking against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| And those folks signed up to speak are Ginger Baxter, Arthur Seymour, Jr., and Hoyle Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| and I'll let you all go in whichever order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| And we will be lenient with the time, as we discussed earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3657)|
| 1:01:03| I am here on behalf of a number of property owners in the affected area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3663)|
| 1:01:09| We will not abuse the kindness you have shown us by giving us additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| We will try to come directly to the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| I am speaking here tonight on behalf of Holston Gases, and Ginger Baxter will do so in a few minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3678)|
| 1:01:25| W.S. Trimble Company, Rinker Materials, Knox River Warehouses, and Specialty Metal Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3685)|
| 1:01:34| These are all industrial establishments that are located in the area affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3694)|
| 1:01:42| In a moment, maybe you all could help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| I'm going to try to explain this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| I have pictures up there that I'll come back to in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3707)|
| 1:01:52| Just to the council members, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| These businesses, in one form or another, have been on the South Waterfront since the early 1900s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3716)|
| 1:02:05| Ginger Baxter, for instance, her family has owned that property since the 40s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| and have operated Holston Gases there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| Rinker Materials' business has been down there in one form or another for 80 or 90 years, since the early 1900s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3734)|
| 1:02:28| Likewise, with Rinker Materials, it was opened there as a Knoxville Sand and Gravel Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3748)|
| 1:02:35| These businesses today employ 600 people on the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3755)|
| 1:02:42| What I have passed to you is a photograph, color-coded inexpertly by me prior to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3762)|
| 1:02:50| Yella generally delineates the area covered by my client's businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3770)|
| 1:02:57| Holston Gases is just to the east of the Gay Street Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3777)|
| 1:03:03| W.S. Trimble is behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| If you go west of the Henley Street Bridge, Rinker Materials is first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| Knox River Warehouses is next, and Specialty Metals after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3789)|
| 1:03:15| I have colored in pink or chartreuse or some such color Marathon Ashland Oil Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3795)|
| 1:03:22| They have stated repeatedly that they are unable to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| and will continue to remain in that location for the foreseeable future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3806)|
| 1:03:32| I have also colored in chartreuse or purple Baptist Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3812)|
| 1:03:37| Assuming everything works out over there, I assume they will remain there for the foreseeable future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3817)|
| 1:03:44| So if you want to go over here and look off the balcony of the city-county building in the next 5, 10, 15, 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3824)|
| 1:03:53| and see some change in your view over there, our clients are the key to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3833)|
| 1:03:59| We already have one project underway at the old Knoxville Glove Company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3839)|
| 1:04:04| and that was designed and done under the C2 zone and is underway at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3844)|
| 1:04:11| The theory of the vision plan is that our clients and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3851)|
| 1:04:18| especially the industrial clients along the riverfront, will redevelop and relocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3858)|
| 1:04:25| That is, the incentives, the financial incentives will be such that it will be in the best interest of these property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3865)|
| 1:04:35| either to sell their property and relocate their businesses to some other location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3875)|
| 1:04:41| or relocate their businesses somewhere else and redevelop the property themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3881)|
| 1:04:47| For that to occur, they need to realize enough out of their property there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3887)|
| 1:04:53| to, one, acquire like property or perhaps larger property elsewhere and to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3893)|
| 1:05:00| And as you can imagine, with a company like Holston Gas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| just the simple act of moving that business if a location could be found is substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3903)|
| 1:05:11| So if you don't want to look out and see the same old thing across the river in 15 or 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3911)|
| 1:05:19| these people need the incentives to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| Right now, all of them intend to remain in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| All of them are either expanding or at least maintaining the present level of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3928)|
| 1:05:34| All of them basically own their property down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3934)|
| 1:05:39| It's been acquired many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| So there is not really the incentive to move unless somebody can help them realize a very good return on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3943)|
| 1:05:52| We are in favor of the ordinance as recommended by the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3952)|
| 1:06:03| This is an interesting ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| I'm not a planner, but I suggest it violates most tenets of zoning and planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3966)|
| 1:06:13| The first thing it does, it's a general rezoning of a large area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| The first thing it does is make all five of these property owners and Marathon Oil nonconforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3978)|
| 1:06:26| Although the south waterfront zone, form-based zone, is a mixed-use zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3986)|
| 1:06:35| there is one use in there that is prohibited, and that's industrial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=3995)|
| 1:06:41| So these owners, to rebuild or expand, have to rely on state law and certain provisions that are in the ordinance right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4001)|
| 1:06:51| Typically, you do not do a general rezoning and down-zone property like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4011)|
| 1:06:59| Second, they have come up with, I think, just back-of-napkin drawings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4019)|
| 1:07:06| some ideas that would be helpful as far as height and redoing the properties down there if they're ever redone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4026)|
| 1:07:15| The consultants two weeks ago, I think, showed us some possible redevelopment scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4035)|
| 1:07:22| Most of them look very monolithic, sort of, you know, towers going down the river, stubby towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4042)|
| 1:07:29| Wouldn't it be better to develop these properties the way many waterfront properties have developed in Florida,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4049)|
| 1:07:37| on the Great Lakes, on the West Coast, and so forth, and allow flexibility in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4057)|
| 1:07:44| allow innovation rather than just marching in lockstep?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4064)|
| 1:07:51| Well, we are promised that we will get an SW-8 zone for the south waterfront form-based code, but we have not seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4071)|
| 1:08:01| Nobody has drafted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| We have no assurance that it will ever be on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4084)|
| 1:08:08| Business people, by and large, can deal with certainty even though they might not like the certainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4088)|
| 1:08:15| What we're basically being asked to do is accept the promise that if these properties are ever redeveloped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4095)|
| 1:08:25| that they will be accommodated if these are exciting developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4105)|
| 1:08:30| A businessman planning a redevelopment of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| or a property owner planning a redevelopment at least likes to have an idea of where he can start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4113)|
| 1:08:41| Without these increased heights, which are minimal, really, and we've done some pretty careful calculations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4121)|
| 1:08:49| We've had architects and developers look at these figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| We feel a lot more comfortable with form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| They are reasonable, very reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4137)|
| 1:09:02| And we ask that you approve the code as recommended by the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4142)|
| 1:09:10| so in 20 years you won't look across the river and see there's Holston Gases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| Wasn't there back in 1946 or 47, and it's still there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| There's W.S. Trimble Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| It's been there forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| There's Rinker Materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| I remember when that was the old Knoxville Sand and Gravel Company back there in the 20s or 30s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| There's Knox River Warehouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| They're still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4173)|
| 1:09:34| There's Specialty Metals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| They're still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4176)|
| 1:09:37| Give us a chance to redevelop these properties and help you achieve the vision you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4177)|
| 1:09:43| That's all we're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4185)|
| 1:09:48| Ginger Baxter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| I am Ginger Baxter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4194)|
| 1:09:55| My address is 3901 Sam Cooper Road in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| Thanks for listening to me and giving me a chance to tell our side of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| And I want to thank everybody that's been involved in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| It has taken a lot of time and energy, and most people have not gotten paid a cent for their involvement in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4207)|
| 1:10:15| But I want to say right away how happy we were with the changes that MPC passed on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4215)|
| 1:10:22| It made it possible for us to get on board with this South Knox Waterfront plan that is part of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4222)|
| 1:10:30| Our family, as Arthur said, owns Holston Gases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4230)|
| 1:10:34| This property is directly on the waterfront east of the Gay Street Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| It amounts to roughly ten acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| We've owned this property for 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| We have an industrial gas business there that employs about 100 folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4246)|
| 1:10:51| We've been a longtime community supporter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| We've been adoptive off and on of South Knox Elementary School where we've had our truck drivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4254)|
| 1:11:00| and accounts receivable and various other people reading stories to the children there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4260)|
| 1:11:04| We are a part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| We consider this our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| We consider this our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| We're not outsiders in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| My husband and I have four young adult children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| They're just entering the workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| We expect that they're going to be back in Knoxville running maybe Holston Gases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4278)|
| 1:11:22| or something else if someday it becomes a good option for us to develop our property along the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4282)|
| 1:11:29| So we do not plan to sell our property, whatever the market demand is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| We plan to own it for the next 50 years, hopefully for the next 100 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| and on into two or three generations from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| We want to continue to be part of this neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| and we're happy that these MPC amendments to the original code make it possible for us to support this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4305)|
| 1:11:55| that the community has developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| We have been involved in the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| and in the development of this since the beginning of 06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4319)|
| 1:12:05| We've been meeting for over a year with the consultants from Boston, with Dave Hill, with you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4325)|
| 1:12:12| We've met a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| And so what we were asking for was a zoning plan to give us a little bit more flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4334)|
| 1:12:19| so we could respond to the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| We have no idea what the market is going to be in the next 10 years there or especially the next 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4341)|
| 1:12:28| But as a person, I am only one voice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| but I represent ten acres that I feel like is very key to the development of the South Knoxville waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4352)|
| 1:12:39| particularly as it is right at the Gay Street Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4359)|
| 1:12:45| The ten acres, that's maybe one of the more commercially viable places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| where there would be pedestrian-friendly restaurants, shops, retail, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4370)|
| 1:12:58| Again, this property, our property is in the SW7 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4378)|
| 1:13:02| Pretty much we're the only property owners in this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| A little bit of southern states asphalt or marathon is in this zoning as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4386)|
| 1:13:13| So we had asked for the three changes regarding the language of the roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4393)|
| 1:13:17| the height of the building and the setback from the river to help us be more flexible so that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4397)|
| 1:13:22| as Arthur was putting, might encourage us to make what is going to surely be a very expensive move for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4402)|
| 1:13:30| We're excited about this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| We're excited that our neighbors will have a chance to benefit from the greenway along the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4412)|
| 1:13:39| I might point out that these greenways are on private property all along the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| so it requires the cooperation of the property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| We're excited that there is an access, which is called the bell tower walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4427)|
| 1:13:51| directly down to the river, perpendicular to the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| Pretty much the entire bell tower walk is on our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4434)|
| 1:13:58| We're not fighting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| We see that as possibly an asset to our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| We want to share the river with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| We want to also provide the view sheds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| So I think a lot of the things that the neighbors, the South Knox community, want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| we also have in mind as high priorities for us, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4453)|
| 1:14:17| And the plan that MPC had passed allows us to be on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4457)|
| 1:14:22| and be encouraged to do some of these things in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4462)|
| 1:14:27| Also, we realize that there is an appeals process plan, this alternative compliance, and possibly the SW7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4467)|
| 1:14:37| But we would prefer a plan like the one that MPC passed that gets it right from the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4477)|
| 1:14:44| It's not broken before it ever gets adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| And also, we would love to be on the side of the positive in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4488)|
| 1:14:55| We would prefer not to be the naysayers operating from a negative position in the community where we've been for the past 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4495)|
| 1:15:03| So I would ask you to approve these MPC changes and help us be unified on the South Knoxville waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4503)|
| 1:15:10| I know a lot of time and money has spent on developing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| When the time is right and the market makes it economically feasible, we would love to work with this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4514)|
| 1:15:21| So I ask you to approve the form-based zoning as MPC passed it so that we can all join together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| in supporting our neighbors on the South Knoxville waterfront plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4532)|
| 1:15:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| Hoyle Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4534)|
| 1:15:38| I'm Hoyle Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| I live at 6614 Sherwood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| I won't go over what Arthur Seymour said, but I will make a couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4542)|
| 1:15:47| The property that I'm involved in is the Knox River Warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| We're directly across the river from the basketball arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4550)|
| 1:15:54| We have seven acres right on the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| The tenant that we have in there now has been there since before the World's Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| Very successful business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| You know, they have no interest in moving, and, you know, we really have no interest in them moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4563)|
| 1:16:10| I've had a lot of realtors call, and I've told them that our property is not for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| Dave Hill mentioned to me last fall that there was a large developer in town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4575)|
| 1:16:20| that had been seeing him from Virginia Beach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| and he kind of indicated he'd like for me to talk with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4583)|
| 1:16:27| I did meet with him one morning for a couple of hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| And DeVars Relative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| Is that the name of the name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| DeVars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| They looked over the documents that they saw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| and they saw the guy that was here told me that the heights of the buildings he saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4598)|
| 1:16:43| at that time were 70 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4603)|
| 1:16:47| And there's also a road cut through our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| And he said, really, we just can't do much with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| And that was the last we heard of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| And shortly before the end of the year, I was at a meeting at the drop-in center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4617)|
| 1:17:02| and found out that the 70 feet, without my knowledge, had been cut to 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4622)|
| 1:17:08| And, you know, I said, you know, y'all can leave it at 50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| but I'm sure there's nothing going to ever happen on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| So it did get, with modifications, increased back to 70 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4635)|
| 1:17:22| You know, we're not trying to develop the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| If some developer comes along, I would think that the residences here that say they want a waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4644)|
| 1:17:31| and I think that you all would want developers to be interested in the form-based code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4651)|
| 1:17:37| and what it says to entice them to make a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4657)|
| 1:17:41| They aren't enticed not to make a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| There just won't be a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| The development on the Knoxville Glove, you know, we asked for 90 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4666)|
| 1:17:52| Really, we asked for 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| The NPC passed it at 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| We've already got a development on Knoxville Glove that's started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4675)|
| 1:17:59| It's coming out of the ground right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| I can't tell you the exact footage, but it's 80 feet or possibly a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4681)|
| 1:18:06| So they desperately need the 90 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| I talked to the man in Atlanta that's in charge of that project this morning, and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| we need the 90 feet or they're going to be in a nonconforming zone before they ever come out of the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4693)|
| 1:18:20| And an attorney would know that that could cause major problems for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4700)|
| 1:18:25| So we would encourage you to approve what the NPC approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4705)|
| 1:18:32| And, you know, our interest is to have the waterfront developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| You know, we're not fighting the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| We're just trying to get something in there that will make it give the developers a chance to do something on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4717)|
| 1:18:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4724)|
| 1:18:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4725)|
| 1:18:51| Counsel, any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| By our rules, normally we give the other side a chance to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4735)|
| 1:18:58| I was going there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4738)|
| 1:18:59| And I don't know if that's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| I guess I could ask if anybody has anything to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| You have three minutes, I think, from anybody from the or two, excuse me, Mr. Swanson corrected me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4745)|
| 1:19:13| If anybody has something new or different to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| I don't think I even need two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| I just want to speak to the fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4758)|
| 1:19:23| Say your name again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4763)|
| 1:19:24| I'm sorry, Rachel Craig, 2222 Allen Home Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| I just wanted to speak to the fear that seems to be there that without the higher building heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4767)|
| 1:19:33| the property will not be economically feasible to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4773)|
| 1:19:40| There were two property owners slash developers on the oversight committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4780)|
| 1:19:48| Both of them are working on site plans in the SW2 zone, which is a lot more restrictive than the SW4 or the SW7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4788)|
| 1:19:57| The building heights are lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| And both of them seem to think that they can develop in that SW2 zone quite economically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4800)|
| 1:20:06| and make a good profit or they wouldn't be doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| They also both concurred with the oversight committee's recommendations as they went to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4809)|
| 1:20:16| So I just wanted to put that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| I will allow just a total of three people to speak for two minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| I don't need two minutes or three minutes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| Rob Dancer, 1302 White Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| I just wanted to come back up here and remind everybody that zoning ordinances are living documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4829)|
| 1:20:36| They're not something that is going to be put in stone right now, and we can't adjust it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4836)|
| 1:20:42| I think that the most updated zoning ordinance online now is October 24th of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4842)|
| 1:20:48| I mean, we change these things quite regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| And that needs to be kept in mind when we look at this code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| It's something that's going to evolve over a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| A lot of these pieces of property that we're talking about, all of it, might not develop in the next 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4856)|
| 1:21:01| Part of it might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4861)|
| 1:21:02| We don't know what the market forces have to hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| You know, development strategies gave us a projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4865)|
| 1:21:08| But, you know, their numbers are only as good as they do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| But just remember that it's a living document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| We will constantly be changing it over the next 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| Joe, do you want to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| Councilman Hokos, would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4884)|
| 1:21:25| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| I've got a couple of little things and a couple of questions real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4886)|
| 1:21:30| One, just on a totally unrelated subject, I've been asked actually to put in some clarifying language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4890)|
| 1:21:37| on the definition of gardens in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| Is that, Mr. Swanson, this would be adding a few words to page 4.1-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| Is that something we can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| If it's a substantive amendment, you may require it to go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| If it's something that MPC did not consider, if you're changing the definitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4912)|
| 1:21:57| then you'll have to go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| This would be right now it says space could be front yard, side yard, rear yard, common gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4919)|
| 1:22:05| And I'd want to add something including fruit and vegetable gardens, just to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4925)|
| 1:22:10| That seems pretty minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| I defer to the experts with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| The chair feels like that is minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| My chair feels like that's minor, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| What does Mr. Donaldson's chair feel like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| I would say that's not a substantive amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| Good, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4947)|
| 1:22:28| At some point, when we finish with the big issue, I'd like to come back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4952)|
| 1:22:33| I actually just want to take a second to compliment Dave Hill and the whole process on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| I think it's pretty amazing that we've gotten down to something where not to belittle the argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4957)|
| 1:22:42| but we're arguing over tens of feet different on things, which is pretty incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4962)|
| 1:22:52| I wanted to ask, I guess, Mr. Hill, just to explain a little bit about the alternative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4972)|
| 1:22:57| I mean, there's a lot of talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| My understanding is that you actually can build considerably higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| If you could just explain sort of how that works, that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| The alternative compliance review basically provides an opportunity that is to make application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4986)|
| 1:23:15| and I think we use the model of a use on review as an analogous situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=4995)|
| 1:23:21| So if the applicant feels that they can fulfill the spirit and intent of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5001)|
| 1:23:27| but they can't meet the letter of the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5007)|
| 1:23:30| they can submit an application to the MPC offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5010)|
| 1:23:35| and the administrative review committee for the South Waterfront would provide recommendations to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5015)|
| 1:23:43| but MPC would make the final decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| An example I can give that I generated was that CityView was already coming out of the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5027)|
| 1:23:54| and so they basically produced a market-driven floor plan that was six stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5034)|
| 1:24:02| and the total square footage in the building is 240,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5042)|
| 1:24:09| So if you take the maximum floor area ratio or basically the ratio of floor space allowed relative to the total site area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5049)|
| 1:24:20| the site is about two acres, and they have a floor area ratio of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5060)|
| 1:24:25| So if you go four times two acres, you come up with over 350,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5065)|
| 1:24:32| So hypothetically, if they were to design this under the SW4 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5072)|
| 1:24:38| they would be able to ask for more height to be able to utilize the 125,000 square feet that they would be able to max out as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5078)|
| 1:24:50| So although you're allowed to get more height or request more height, but not request more floor area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5090)|
| 1:24:58| it still provides significant advantages if the market is there for more development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5098)|
| 1:25:04| Just to clarify, so if the formula allows them to build X square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| but the height restriction doesn't, go through again what exactly the process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5109)|
| 1:25:14| Make application at the MPC offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| You make your case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| I think that there are requirements in terms of showing a site plan and other aspects of the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5119)|
| 1:25:27| MPC has the final decision-making authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| And I don't know if that would be considered appealable to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5130)|
| 1:25:36| That's where I start to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5136)|
| 1:25:38| Mr. Donaldson, you want to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| Any decision by the planning commission regarding the zoning code is subject to appeal to the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5140)|
| 1:25:47| It would be appealable to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5149)|
| 1:25:50| And the use on review is the model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5150)|
| 1:25:53| These are things that are fairly common that MPC deals with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5155)|
| 1:25:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5156)|
| 1:25:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5157)|
| 1:25:58| Let me ask two other sort of issues that I've heard in the past that don't seem to be on the table now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5158)|
| 1:26:04| One is just sort of the concern about Mimosa Avenue and that sort of section of the neighborhood that's in the yellow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5164)|
| 1:26:10| whatever, SW3, I guess, some concern of residents of wanting to be in the red as opposed to the yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5170)|
| 1:26:15| And where are we at on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| We received a petition from a woman by the name of Bess Newton, did a nice job on the petition, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5177)|
| 1:26:24| We did a comparison of the petition signatures with the 26 owners of record within that area that subject to the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5184)|
| 1:26:34| And I think we had a 19% match rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5194)|
| 1:26:38| And so my response back to Ms. Newton was that the issue isn't considered dead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5198)|
| 1:26:45| and we would be reluctant to move forward unless we had a much more significant majority asking for that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5205)|
| 1:26:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5213)|
| 1:26:54| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5214)|
| 1:26:55| I was struck, actually, the yellow is not that significantly different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| I mean, the form of it is different from SW1, but it's not huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5218)|
| 1:27:04| The last one, I almost hate asking about this because it is the continuing education credit thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5224)|
| 1:27:10| but where we're at with the preexisting non-conforming use, which I don't, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| I'm sort of scared to ask what the latest outcome on that is, but that seems like a real big issue with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5234)|
| 1:27:19| And if somebody can explain that in layman's terms, it would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5239)|
| 1:27:23| Well, I think the best explanation is that I think that we've satisfied all sides that had concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5243)|
| 1:27:29| But if you have, if you want the continuing education credit explanation, Ms. Poplin can do that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5249)|
| 1:27:38| Just briefly, these industrial uses that are becoming non-conforming will be allowed to exist, to continue, to expand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5258)|
| 1:27:47| and that's all dictated by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| And I'm sorry, when you say to expand, just I want to make sure we're clear, expand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5271)|
| 1:27:56| as to their current use they can expand the size of the operation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| Yes, they can expand within the perimeters of the property that they currently own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5280)|
| 1:28:05| Are you through, Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| For now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5287)|
| 1:28:08| For now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5288)|
| 1:28:09| That's a good way to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| I think most of the speakers have really stated their case as well on both sides of this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5295)|
| 1:28:21| and I appreciate both sides and how they've articulated their concerns and their desires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5301)|
| 1:28:29| The process, the process, the process, we keep hearing about the process, but it's so key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| Everyone that's been involved has invested so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5314)|
| 1:28:38| The city has invested a lot of money, first of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| But beyond that, and even more importantly, so many people from the city administration, the consultants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5320)|
| 1:28:46| of course they're getting paid, but they've still worked, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5326)|
| 1:28:50| above and beyond the call of duty for what they've produced versus what they've been paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5330)|
| 1:28:55| And many, many, many people from the community have been very involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5335)|
| 1:28:59| including major property owners in their meetings with the consultants, their private meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5339)|
| 1:29:06| But it's key here that we do honor what we said we were going to do and uphold this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5346)|
| 1:29:13| And I think that's foundational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| Now, that said, I see things I'd like to see changed in this code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5356)|
| 1:29:22| I've even articulated one of those possible changes to the point of submitting a letter to the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5362)|
| 1:29:28| for their January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| But I said I don't want to deal with it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5370)|
| 1:29:33| I don't think it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| I think the time will come when it's appropriate to address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| either through the alternative compliance review process that Mr. Hill explained so well a minute ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5378)|
| 1:29:45| or through what we anticipate, the SW8 alternative, which is, as Mr. Steenmore said, it's not in place yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5385)|
| 1:29:54| But we said we want to move ahead with that so that all the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5394)|
| 1:29:58| SW1 through SW7, are site-specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5398)|
| 1:30:01| They're tied to specific parcels of property or districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5401)|
| 1:30:06| The SW8 would not be, but it would require a much more rigorous process to go through to justify any proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5406)|
| 1:30:15| variances or changes from those allowances that you can bill by right to under the other SW1 through SW7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5415)|
| 1:30:25| And given that, I think we have to understand that the --it's important to understand that where we've arrived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5425)|
| 1:30:33| with the vision plan and with the code as it came through the process prior to going to MPC has a tremendous amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5433)|
| 1:30:42| of integrity because it has a tremendous amount of work and thought and analysis that went into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5442)|
| 1:30:48| And to say let's just change those numbers, building heights in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5448)|
| 1:30:53| but also the setbacks on the riverwalk easement, to change those without an equivalent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5453)|
| 1:31:01| or even greater level of analysis, and I would argue that we need an even higher level of analysis from this point on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5461)|
| 1:31:08| I think would be very risky indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| As Ms. Craig pointed out, the building height issue, the building measurements are taken from the primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5471)|
| 1:31:19| the average of the primary street frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5479)|
| 1:31:23| That's the center line of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| And so in the case of a piece of property where you have a tremendous amount of topographic variation like Holston Gases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5485)|
| 1:31:33| they could actually subdivide their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| And if they were allowed 100 feet, it would be the average of that whatever the frontage was on Council Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5496)|
| 1:31:45| So that would tower, I say literally tower above the Gay Street Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5505)|
| 1:31:50| That may be where we want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| And I am not saying we shouldn't allow them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5512)|
| 1:31:55| Please don't interpret what I'm saying as to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5515)|
| 1:31:59| But if we allow them to do that, we need to be very thorough about making that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5519)|
| 1:32:05| And we now have tools that we didn't even have at the beginning of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5525)|
| 1:32:11| We have a computer analysis tool that allows the model that was developed, the virtual model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5531)|
| 1:32:18| the South Waterfront to be examined in a 3-D virtual reality format so we can play what ifs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5538)|
| 1:32:24| We can look from any perspective and see what a building mass might look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5544)|
| 1:32:30| If it's tall, if it's fat, if it's oriented perpendicular to the river or parallel to the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5550)|
| 1:32:36| I mean, there are all kinds of options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| Creativity should not be stifled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| And that's what we're after here is giving people the opportunity to come back with creative alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5561)|
| 1:32:48| if they cannot accomplish what they want to do by right under SW1 through SW7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5568)|
| 1:32:54| depending on where their property is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| I think we've got to hold the line there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| That said, I want to see us, and I want to make sure this is on record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5580)|
| 1:33:05| I want to see us make it possible from a market standpoint for all of those major property owners to relocate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5585)|
| 1:33:12| for it to work for them, for the market forces, for the return on investment to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5592)|
| 1:33:18| I personally want to see that happen, but I want to make sure we get there the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5598)|
| 1:33:24| I want to make sure we don't undercut what we've already done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5604)|
| 1:33:28| and put ourselves in a position where people feel like they've been betrayed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| and where later on we might say, man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| if we'd just given ourselves the opportunity to have a little more scrutiny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5613)|
| 1:33:37| that whatever that was wouldn't have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| So I'd encourage council to approve this as the amendment with the amendment that is now on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5619)|
| 1:33:47| I saw Vice Mayor Brown first, and I'll go to Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5630)|
| 1:33:51| I appreciate the comments from the councilman from the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5631)|
| 1:33:55| It kind of made me start thinking as I listened to him talk because some of the points he makes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5635)|
| 1:34:02| you know, in his district are valid points, but I'm struggling here on a couple of fronts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5642)|
| 1:34:10| The alternative compliance process, while it sounds good, somebody talked to me hypothetically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5650)|
| 1:34:19| that the alternative compliance process works this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| It comes in through MPC, and it's appealable back to this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5662)|
| 1:34:26| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5666)|
| 1:34:27| I don't want to get into the mathematical equation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5667)|
| 1:34:30| but ultimately they go through the administrative review committee of the South Waterfront, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5670)|
| 1:34:35| and then to MPC, and then that can then be appealed to this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5678)|
| 1:34:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5679)|
| 1:34:40| Very similar to what we're doing right here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5680)|
| 1:34:42| And at that juncture, what's the comfort level for these potential developers to feel that process is going to lend itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5682)|
| 1:34:50| to maybe allowing them to get into a position where the market can assist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5690)|
| 1:34:54| and what they can do with their property because ultimately they're right back here through MPC process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5694)|
| 1:35:00| And if hypothetically MPC does what it did and it gets appealed to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5700)|
| 1:35:04| we may be having this same conversation about betrayal, original intent of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5704)|
| 1:35:10| Council don't change it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| So I'm trying to understand is that real process one of comfort for these particular property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5712)|
| 1:35:19| or is it actually one of just another step in a process that's going to allow us to be right back here again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5719)|
| 1:35:23| So that's one question I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| Are you directing that at anybody in particular?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| Whoever wishes to answer that who has the best answer for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| It could be MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| That could be you or Dave or maybe even if the property owners feel very comfortable about that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5732)|
| 1:35:37| But when I hear it, my vision says we'll be right here again with the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5737)|
| 1:35:43| kind of hearing the same arguments about the original plan and the intent and we don't want to mislead folk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5743)|
| 1:35:48| And we wanted these heights to be this way and that's the way it should be and the original intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5748)|
| 1:35:53| and the process and betrayal and we'll be right back here making the same kind of decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5753)|
| 1:35:58| We have to be made now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| So it means we're putting that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| So that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5762)|
| 1:36:03| I'd be glad to respond to that if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5765)|
| 1:36:06| I can break them down or I can lay them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5766)|
| 1:36:07| Let me just respond to that real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| I can't speak for all the people in the community, but time and again as we've gone through this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5770)|
| 1:36:14| and certainly recently with the discussions around this approval stage that we're in now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5774)|
| 1:36:20| what I think I've heard from most of the people, if not all the people in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5780)|
| 1:36:24| is they understand the alternative review, compliance review process and anticipate an SW8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5784)|
| 1:36:31| They anticipate these alternative review processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5791)|
| 1:36:35| And I think there's a fairly high comfort level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| I think that people in the community would want to be engaged, but I don't think anyone will see that as a betrayal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5798)|
| 1:36:44| because they know that's part of it and a necessary part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5804)|
| 1:36:48| They just want to see that extra level of review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5808)|
| 1:36:52| And back to your earlier comment about you want to see these properties hopefully develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5812)|
| 1:36:58| be market-driven and want to go about the right way with a better process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5818)|
| 1:37:02| and let's not change right now without having the benefit of all the hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5822)|
| 1:37:08| and things that we've had before and meetings to get this plan where it is almost says to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5828)|
| 1:37:14| is this a time to really have those kind of discussions now before we approve this document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5834)|
| 1:37:20| And I say that to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| Once the plan is approved, and while it will not be in stone, as Mr. Dantzler said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5843)|
| 1:37:29| once the plan is approved and then you keep going back and tinkering with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5849)|
| 1:37:33| I think you have more of an issue of problems with fulfilling that you're changing in midstream as opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5853)|
| 1:37:42| to bringing a product before us that hopefully has addressed everything that needs to be addressed that we have before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5862)|
| 1:37:49| Right now we have a very important issue before us that concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5869)|
| 1:37:54| And if we can allow for another period of time this council has done before to maybe allow some additional vetting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5874)|
| 1:38:02| as you've kind of implied maybe we need to do in the future if we're going to address these issues of height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5882)|
| 1:38:08| maybe we should do that now as opposed to later is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5888)|
| 1:38:12| And so that the plan comes back and we've already done it as opposed to doing it later and coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5892)|
| 1:38:17| Is that potentially a consideration now as opposed to approving it today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5897)|
| 1:38:22| Well, I'm sorry, I appreciate your comments and you putting that in sort of on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5902)|
| 1:38:29| My response to that, and, again, this is a dialogue, but just in terms of what you said so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5909)|
| 1:38:37| we have property owners right now who are major industrial property owners who are developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5917)|
| 1:38:43| or preparing to develop their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| They're not part of this group of five that Mr. Seymour is representing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| nor Marathon Petroleum and Marathon Asphalt, which has their own council in representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5930)|
| 1:39:01| Those property owners are saying to us, and I'm sorry Mr. Gumpert can't be here tonight because he owns two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5941)|
| 1:39:08| Well, one's under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| I don't know if he owns it yet, but they own City View,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| and they're in the process of acquiring the old tank farm site next to Island Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5952)|
| 1:39:17| They have it under contract and expect to close shortly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| and they're already in the process of doing site design and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| What he has said consistently is, you know, there are things that we would like to see changed ideally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5964)|
| 1:39:30| but we're okay with the code as it is and ready to move forward, and we'd like to see it enacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5970)|
| 1:39:36| And they understand that there is built into it a necessity, a review process, and a one-year revisiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5976)|
| 1:39:45| It's mandated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5985)|
| 1:39:46| And so they're okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5986)|
| 1:39:47| The Connellys, another major property owner, wants to see it passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5987)|
| 1:39:52| and they're ready to try to do something with their property, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5992)|
| 1:39:56| And I don't want to say too much about them publicly, but I know that they've expressed that publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=5996)|
| 1:40:00| And so what you hear here is major property owners that are not ready to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6000)|
| 1:40:08| but want to keep their maximized and optimize their options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| I certainly appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| But I think they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| And, again, I think we're not in a position, if we try to back up and analyze building heights and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6015)|
| 1:40:23| we kick the clock back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| We say, okay, we're going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| We're going to bring in the consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| And we stop this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6029)|
| 1:40:31| We arrest this process and put it back by months probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6031)|
| 1:40:36| And those property owners that are ready to move forward essentially cannot move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6036)|
| 1:40:40| with the exception of City View because they would just continue to operate under the C2, the old zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6040)|
| 1:40:47| But they know that they're coming in under the new zoning, and there are some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6047)|
| 1:40:52| But those issues can be addressed, as Mr. Hill pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| So I think the only thing that makes sense at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6056)|
| 1:41:00| and uphold the integrity of the process and allow everyone to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6060)|
| 1:41:04| is to approve and then built into it, again, built into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6064)|
| 1:41:10| with everybody understanding that up front, is mandatory review in one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6070)|
| 1:41:16| And that doesn't even mean it can't be amended in the interim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| But I think this council should be very careful about anything done prior to the one year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6078)|
| 1:41:25| that does it other than SW8 or the alternative compliance review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| Does that help at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6090)|
| 1:41:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6091)|
| 1:41:32| And I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6092)|
| 1:41:33| It's very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| Basically what I heard you say in all that was we've got some property owners that are on go right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6094)|
| 1:41:40| that are stopped on go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6100)|
| 1:41:42| And if we hold this off anymore, it's going to continue to have them in a holding pattern that may not be fair for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6102)|
| 1:41:48| And I think that's valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| One other thing, back to your recommendations here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6109)|
| 1:41:53| that you helped me understand against the backdrop of the argument about integrity of the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6113)|
| 1:42:00| how is it acceptable to accept recommendation one and five and not two, three, and four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6120)|
| 1:42:07| Those are essentially housekeeping items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| In fact, the one on the trees was actually a typo that no one had caught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6129)|
| 1:42:13| And the consultants and everyone agreed that that was what happened there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6133)|
| 1:42:16| And, you know, it's just originally it was one tree per surface parking space, and that's not realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6136)|
| 1:42:24| It just somehow somebody messed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| That was discovered at MPC, if my recollection is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| In the discovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6151)|
| 1:42:32| Trey Benefield, MPC commissioner, pointed that out and included that in his amendment motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6152)|
| 1:42:39| The road, the flexible road alignment language, and Mr. Hill may want to speak to this, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6159)|
| 1:42:44| but that was that's language that everybody says, yeah, that really was a better way of putting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6164)|
| 1:42:51| That's essentially saying what everyone intended to say anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6171)|
| 1:42:55| So these are really housekeeping issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6178)|
| 1:42:59| See, nobody said that initially because from a logic point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6179)|
| 1:43:02| when I hear arguments about integrity of the process, but these couple of things we like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6182)|
| 1:43:07| even though it still could be volatile of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| I appreciate you bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6189)|
| 1:43:10| But these three we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| It seems more like we're not really concerned about the integrity of the process, but what we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6192)|
| 1:43:16| and what we don't want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6196)|
| 1:43:17| But is that consistent, Dave, with what Councilman Hoek has just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| Yes, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| I think that the number one on the regulating plan is simply clarifying what the true intent was all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6203)|
| 1:43:30| And then the last one was fixing an error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6213)|
| 1:43:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6216)|
| 1:43:37| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6217)|
| 1:43:38| I just want to add my or express my gratitude for everybody's participation in this public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6218)|
| 1:43:45| And I think it's been a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| And I think this council, all of us have really pushed for public inclusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6226)|
| 1:43:52| and public participation in debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| And I think it's been excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| And I've been involved in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| I think I've made most of the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| I did miss the meeting over at TSD the other night where I heard some rumblings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6241)|
| 1:44:08| and some issues that I hadn't heard really before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6248)|
| 1:44:12| I had pinched myself along during the process thinking, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6252)|
| 1:44:16| this is really going too great and too smooth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6256)|
| 1:44:20| And then the MPC acted and the amendments came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6260)|
| 1:44:27| And, you know, since Thursday, I've had a chance to think about these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6267)|
| 1:44:34| which I'm a little uncomfortable in trying to sort through this in a manner that I think speaks to the process itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6274)|
| 1:44:43| When I look at the total process, I looked at MPC as being part of this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6283)|
| 1:44:49| and I've sort of remained open and thought about, you know, what the outcome of that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6289)|
| 1:44:55| And I guess where I am tonight is I have total respect for the process on one hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6295)|
| 1:45:01| And on the other hand, I have to recognize these other property owners that have significant interests in this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6301)|
| 1:45:09| And I think, you know, not only do we need to recognize them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6309)|
| 1:45:13| but we need to show them the respect that I think we've afforded everyone through this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6313)|
| 1:45:18| although I wish I had heard of some of these, you know, stern interests at some time before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6318)|
| 1:45:26| But having said that, I know we have a workshop scheduled for this coming Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6326)|
| 1:45:33| And, you know, I plan to try to move the process along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6333)|
| 1:45:36| I think we owe it to the process itself to discuss these issues, these concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6336)|
| 1:45:43| I think we need everybody's participation in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6343)|
| 1:45:49| We need to bring them along out of a 150-page document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6349)|
| 1:45:54| We're down to two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| As Councilman Becker said, we're just a few feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| And that's the way I look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| And we've all encouraged and worked with communities and neighborhoods and so forth to try to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6361)|
| 1:46:07| And I don't know if tonight's the place to start that debate, if there's any room to, you know, to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6367)|
| 1:46:17| Are there any areas that we could, you know, work together on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6377)|
| 1:46:21| But, you know, during the workshop, I think that's the time to really discuss what should have been discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6381)|
| 1:46:27| and I wish had been discussed earlier in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6387)|
| 1:46:31| So I plan to move this along, whether we have amendments or no amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| And here in the next two weeks, after the first reading, I think we need to really hash these things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6395)|
| 1:46:41| So that's where I'm at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6404)|
| 1:46:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6405)|
| 1:46:46| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6406)|
| 1:46:47| Just briefly, I guess when Vice Mayor Brown was talking about how you sort of said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6407)|
| 1:46:51| something like I wish we could work out all these details beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| And to give you all a heads up, there are a lot of rezonings coming up after this where we're doing really sort of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6415)|
| 1:47:01| that would look strange off the, you know, we've got an area that's sector plans that should be industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6421)|
| 1:47:08| and we're going to make it commercial and, you know, sort of stuff that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| And in some sense, I had a conversation this afternoon with Mr. Donaldson about a bunch of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6432)|
| 1:47:19| And while I would love for us to be able to say we can work out all the details beforehand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6439)|
| 1:47:23| so much of this does come down to what happens on the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6443)|
| 1:47:28| And I think it is exactly right for that stuff to come here for final decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| And, yes, it doesn't give people the confidence necessarily of what's done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| but we're the ultimately elected people in this community that represent the decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6456)|
| 1:47:42| And I think that's a good system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6462)|
| 1:47:45| I wish it was a lot tighter than it was, just like you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| But it's a system we got, and I think it's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6467)|
| 1:47:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6470)|
| 1:47:51| I'm going to go to Vice Mayor Brown and then to Ms. Peele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6473)|
| 1:47:54| I think it's a great system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6474)|
| 1:47:55| And I guess the reason I said it would be good to work it out on the front end is so that maybe in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6475)|
| 1:48:00| we wouldn't be back like we're coming tonight to deal with some rezonings and some issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| because maybe a long time ago a council or whoever put those together didn't maybe have that extra discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6484)|
| 1:48:10| at the workshop that may have put those last couple of feet to rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6490)|
| 1:48:15| That was why I made that suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| My hope is, and hopefully Councilman Holk, which you're in agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6497)|
| 1:48:21| that at the workshop that you called for that we're going to have next Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6501)|
| 1:48:26| that maybe this can still be a part of the discussion about the thought and the process with regards to this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6506)|
| 1:48:31| as Councilman Bailey has suggested as we try to kind of move forward here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6511)|
| 1:48:35| but understand that that's still an issue that we've got to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6515)|
| 1:48:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6519)|
| 1:48:40| Ms. Peele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6520)|
| 1:48:41| It's certainly been stated in many ways by many people, but this has been a long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6521)|
| 1:48:48| And I feel this council has been very seriously engaged in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6528)|
| 1:48:53| And, you know, when this discussion all began, it seemed to be am I amusing you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6533)|
| 1:49:02| Help me with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6542)|
| 1:49:04| Because if I am, I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6544)|
| 1:49:08| Well, I mean, help me, because that is very disconcerting when you're trying to make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6548)|
| 1:49:18| I don't even know if I can continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6558)|
| 1:49:21| You've really embarrassed me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| Please go ahead, Ms. Peele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6563)|
| 1:49:30| I can go to someone else and come back if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6570)|
| 1:49:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6571)|
| 1:49:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6572)|
| 1:49:33| Ms. Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6573)|
| 1:49:35| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6575)|
| 1:49:36| As a member of the South Waterfront Oversight Committee, I feel like I'm obligated to come forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6576)|
| 1:49:44| And this has been a long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| As someone pointed out, we committed to the mayor to be part of this over 18 months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6586)|
| 1:49:51| And our commitment as an oversight committee was that the process would be transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6591)|
| 1:49:57| The mayor asked that it be transparent and that it be economically viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6597)|
| 1:50:01| And I think we've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| I'm proud of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6603)|
| 1:50:04| And if I felt like we were looking at something tonight, and, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6604)|
| 1:50:09| I'm talking about the amended motion that Councilman Holquist made tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6609)|
| 1:50:14| If I felt like we were talking about something that I truly felt like was going to compromise the ability of any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6614)|
| 1:50:21| property holder, residential, industrial, whatever, to get maximum use out of their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6621)|
| 1:50:28| I'd have a real concern and I'd want to put the brakes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6628)|
| 1:50:31| But I feel like with the alternative methods that we've talked about tonight, there are at least three alternative paths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6631)|
| 1:50:38| I feel like there is flexibility in this plan and that it is time to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6638)|
| 1:50:44| I can't support what I see as the 11th hour amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| the ones that were not housekeeping amendments that were made by MPC last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6647)|
| 1:50:51| I can't support them as a member of the oversight committee because I feel like that would betray the public trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6651)|
| 1:50:57| As a member of the committee, we met for four hours the last time we met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6657)|
| 1:51:01| and the plan came with full consensus to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6661)|
| 1:51:05| And so for those reasons, I will support the motion as amended by Councilman Holquist tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6665)|
| 1:51:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6671)|
| 1:51:12| Ms. Pelo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6672)|
| 1:51:13| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6673)|
| 1:51:14| I'm sure I have nothing of any importance to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6678)|
| 1:51:19| And along with Councilman Bailey, we need to move this thing forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6679)|
| 1:51:23| I understand that when I bring these issues up and ask these questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| one of the things that kind of pops out of my head that concerns me is when I sometimes hear the implication that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6686)|
| 1:51:34| when we have a great process and things have been vetted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6694)|
| 1:51:38| that it almost implies that MPC should rubber stamp and this council should rubber stamp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6698)|
| 1:51:43| because we've had long processes and long meetings and a lot of community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6703)|
| 1:51:48| And, therefore, let's not touch it and let's not let the experts at MPC look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6708)|
| 1:51:54| If they change it, they shouldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6714)|
| 1:51:56| They should stamp it and this council should stamp it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6716)|
| 1:51:58| And that's why I sometimes step back and say, well, let's at least engage in a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6718)|
| 1:52:02| I think I see Councilman Becker do that sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6722)|
| 1:52:05| That's sometimes my impetus and part of my impetus here because we have to be very careful, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6725)|
| 1:52:10| as a council in some of the things we do and how we go about doing them without discussing things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6730)|
| 1:52:15| If you go through a process and do 18 months or two years of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6735)|
| 1:52:19| then it's got to be automatically approved word-for-word by MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| and automatically approved word-for-word by council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| And no one said that, but that's one of those underlying kind of things that we have to be very careful about not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6746)|
| 1:52:31| implying to the public because it almost sounds as if, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| we're here to just rubber stamp it if we think there's a process that's incurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6754)|
| 1:52:38| And, actually, what Councilman Becker said earlier, we're elected to make hard decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| and, I think, ask hard questions, not because we don't like an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6761)|
| 1:52:45| or we don't want to see something develop, but because we want to see the public discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6765)|
| 1:52:51| Councilman Whitehall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6771)|
| 1:52:54| I agree with what you just said, but I also know that we have in the past made decisions to put a lot of the work in front of the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6774)|
| 1:53:06| We should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6786)|
| 1:53:07| Because their wisdom is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6787)|
| 1:53:12| And I know you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| So when I hear us talk about protecting the process or supporting the process, I'm not hearing rubber stamp at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6794)|
| 1:53:24| I don't think anybody here would rubber stamp it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| We would pay attention to red flags, but not rubber stamp it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6807)|
| 1:53:34| The public process develops its own brain about an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6814)|
| 1:53:40| And we, because we want that kind of wisdom and investment from the people themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6820)|
| 1:53:47| we're just monitoring and supporting that kind of new work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6827)|
| 1:53:52| That's how I take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6832)|
| 1:53:57| And as far as it going to MPC, there are going to be additional sort of critical conversations that I don't think are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6837)|
| 1:54:06| necessarily part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6846)|
| 1:54:08| I think there are other kinds of procedures that take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6848)|
| 1:54:13| But, you know, the fact that this took 19 months, was a very open process, had a very diverse group of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6853)|
| 1:54:21| and does, in fact, have an alternative compliance review to address and work with your very important concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6861)|
| 1:54:30| And there have been lots of compromises within the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6870)|
| 1:54:34| I support what Councilman Holquist is offering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6874)|
| 1:54:41| But we're not rubber stamping anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6881)|
| 1:54:45| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6885)|
| 1:54:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6886)|
| 1:54:47| I don't pretend to have made as many meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| I wasn't on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6889)|
| 1:54:51| I do want to recognize that Hoyle Gill was there every time I turned around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6891)|
| 1:54:55| He was integrally involved in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6895)|
| 1:55:00| You know, I've talked to Bill Baxter on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6900)|
| 1:55:03| I've talked to other folks on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| And, you know, listen to what they've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6905)|
| 1:55:08| It's first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6908)|
| 1:55:11| We may or may not be having a workshop on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| So, you know, let's see what happens between now and second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6913)|
| 1:55:18| Second, I would like to apologize to Mrs. Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| There was something that was said that struck me and maybe some others as funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6921)|
| 1:55:27| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6927)|
| 1:55:28| And I would like her to reconsider imparting what she had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6928)|
| 1:55:34| Anybody else like to make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6934)|
| 1:55:39| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6939)|
| 1:55:40| At some point, Mr. Frost just said we may or may not have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6940)|
| 1:55:43| I hope we've made that decision by the end of the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6943)|
| 1:55:46| or by the time we finish talking about the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6946)|
| 1:55:49| I think there are people who care, and if we're having one or not, we should let them know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6949)|
| 1:55:56| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6956)|
| 1:55:57| Does the council for the first district think there's no need for the workshop now that we've got this in front of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6957)|
| 1:56:05| I think we scheduled it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6965)|
| 1:56:08| We have time blocked out for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6968)|
| 1:56:10| The room is, you know, reserved and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6970)|
| 1:56:14| I think if council wants to have a workshop, we ought to have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6974)|
| 1:56:18| I'm not sure if we need to have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6978)|
| 1:56:21| I think that's up to other council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6981)|
| 1:56:25| I don't know if there will be any new information imparted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6985)|
| 1:56:29| We've, because of the thoroughness of the process to date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6989)|
| 1:56:34| I suspect that there won't be a lot of new information, but I don't think that should preclude us continuing this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=6994)|
| 1:56:41| So I think if other council members feel like that's of value, then we should definitely have the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7001)|
| 1:56:48| What does Mr. Hill feel about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7008)|
| 1:56:49| Because I know that may have gotten started with an inquiry from you about coming back to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7009)|
| 1:56:55| and the workshop to continue this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7015)|
| 1:56:58| We have the consultants ready to come, and we're ready to work with council in whatever way you decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7018)|
| 1:57:03| Will some of the issues that were discussed tonight be a part of that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7023)|
| 1:57:07| or would it just be, I guess, telling us what's already here in this document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7027)|
| 1:57:12| Well, my sense is that we have a 150-page ordinance, and the good news is we're down to three issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7032)|
| 1:57:20| The bad news is there's no easy answer to those three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7040)|
| 1:57:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7043)|
| 1:57:24| So I think, unless you tell me otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7044)|
| 1:57:27| that the workshop would really focus in on the remaining issue of the river buffer setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7047)|
| 1:57:35| and the maximum heights in the SW4 and SW7 districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7055)|
| 1:57:40| We'll have David Gamble, who is an architect, available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7060)|
| 1:57:44| Walter Kulosh, who helped design the transportation system, is available to come during the early part of the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7064)|
| 1:57:51| So we're ready to discuss whatever issues you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7071)|
| 1:57:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7075)|
| 1:57:56| I'm glad to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7076)|
| 1:57:57| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7077)|
| 1:57:58| I think in light of that, if we're going to continue to talk about those three issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7078)|
| 1:58:03| we'll pass on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7083)|
| 1:58:04| I think it may be a need for us to have the workshop to allow them to further flesh out for some of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7084)|
| 1:58:10| the whole issue of those three issues and the facts and circumstances and history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7090)|
| 1:58:15| and, you know, kind of continue that kind of open debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7095)|
| 1:58:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7098)|
| 1:58:19| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7099)|
| 1:58:20| I didn't know if Mr. Seymour or Mrs. Baxter or Mr. Gill had a preference of a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7100)|
| 1:58:26| or one-on-one meetings or anything at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7106)|
| 1:58:36| One of our clients, Ed Prince, with Rinker Materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7116)|
| 1:58:39| who's in charge of their real properties throughout the United States, could not be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7119)|
| 1:58:44| He can be here for the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7124)|
| 1:58:46| However, he would just as soon meet with you however you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7126)|
| 1:58:50| He actually brings some pretty good experience to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7130)|
| 1:58:55| He has been trained in planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7135)|
| 1:58:58| He is in charge of redeveloping or developing properties owned by Rinker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7138)|
| 1:59:03| and those are several hundred in number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7143)|
| 1:59:06| He would be happy to come in and talk to you individually about this issue or collectively about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7146)|
| 1:59:13| I think he has spoken at one of the meetings and may have met with some of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7153)|
| 1:59:19| Otherwise, you're going to hear from Mr. Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7159)|
| 1:59:24| Mrs. Baxter, me, and where did Mr. Taylor go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7164)|
| 1:59:32| Mr. Taylor is back in the back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7172)|
| 1:59:36| Do you want my address again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7176)|
| 1:59:38| I think we got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7178)|
| 1:59:39| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7179)|
| 1:59:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7180)|
| 1:59:41| We'll certainly be glad to come to the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7181)|
| 1:59:45| If Mr. Hill doesn't know this process by now, it's just a waste of money to bring those consultants in again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7185)|
| 1:59:52| I'll say the same thing that Ms. Roddy heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7192)|
| 1:59:55| And quite frankly, and we didn't bring this issue up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7195)|
| 1:59:59| but at the last meeting that the consultants were here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7199)|
| 2:00:03| Gavin McMillan, the consultant, opened up the meeting insulting us for delaying the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7203)|
| 2:00:10| It's one of the worst things I've ever heard at a meeting like that, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7210)|
| 2:00:15| Gavin McMillan, one of the consultants, insulted us for delaying the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7215)|
| 2:00:20| and they just treated us like a bunch of low-life people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7220)|
| 2:00:23| You know, I had people on your committee, Ms. Roddy, call me and said they'd never heard anything that bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7223)|
| 2:00:30| I know Arthur sent you a thing, Dave, and you said you didn't have a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7230)|
| 2:00:34| Well, they're worse than people who complain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| But, you know, if we have the workshop, we'll be glad to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7236)|
| 2:00:40| But I see no reason for the city to pay the consultants because they're just going to say the same thing that they said before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7240)|
| 2:00:46| And I think Mr. Hill knows all that what they're going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7246)|
| 2:00:49| He ought to know the answers to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7249)|
| 2:00:51| So we'll be glad to be there if you all want to have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7251)|
| 2:00:56| Councilman Hawkins or Ms. Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7256)|
| 2:00:59| Well, I think this is somewhat a digression, but I will make some comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7259)|
| 2:01:03| because I really do want to express my appreciation for the lengthy process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7263)|
| 2:01:09| and the seriousness with which everyone has engaged in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7269)|
| 2:01:14| And I have to say that in the very beginning, I really did not expect to ever come to this day when we had a plan before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7274)|
| 2:01:24| that had been reached by a consensus and by the public process that we have experienced regarding this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7284)|
| 2:01:33| So I really did want to commend everyone who's been involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7293)|
| 2:01:37| I think it's been one of the most extraordinary experiences I've seen in city government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7297)|
| 2:01:43| Many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| So I appreciate all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7305)|
| 2:01:47| I also have a number of extremely good friends, even family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7307)|
| 2:01:52| that are involved in some of the properties that we have been looking at tonight with a lot of scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7312)|
| 2:02:00| And, you know, and I realize to say family might not be a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7320)|
| 2:02:05| But on the other hand, it's reality, and I think many people know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7325)|
| 2:02:11| I just wanted to comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7331)|
| 2:02:13| And we've all talked openly about where we are and where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7333)|
| 2:02:18| and how we're going to come to the conclusions that each of us do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7338)|
| 2:02:23| So I want to thank everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| And, Hoyle, you have been one of the most faithful attendees at all of these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7345)|
| 2:02:30| And I want to commend you for that because it's been very helpful to know, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7350)|
| 2:02:34| where you stand and what you feel your needs are and how you're expressing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7354)|
| 2:02:39| and advocating that for other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7359)|
| 2:02:44| I just feel so very committed to the entire process that everyone has been through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7364)|
| 2:02:51| And I so respect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7371)|
| 2:02:53| That is weighing very heavily on my desire to approve the plan as it was presented to MPC prior to the revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7373)|
| 2:03:04| Because I really feel that those many, many, many people who are not here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7384)|
| 2:03:10| many of them we've heard from in e-mails, many of them have communicated to us individually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7390)|
| 2:03:15| their interest in seeing the plan as they had been involved in it approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7395)|
| 2:03:21| So I have a great amount of confidence, not only in the process that's passed regarding this vision plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7401)|
| 2:03:29| but in what I hope is going to be a very bright future for South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7409)|
| 2:03:36| And I don't think any of us have a crystal ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7416)|
| 2:03:39| And I don't think any of us know what the market might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7419)|
| 2:03:43| I know of high hopes my family had for it in the 50s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7423)|
| 2:03:48| It didn't work out for my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7428)|
| 2:03:51| But many of you all lived there then and were just as in love with your homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7431)|
| 2:03:55| and your property there at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7435)|
| 2:03:58| This may be the time for South Knoxville to bloom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7438)|
| 2:04:01| I hope that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7441)|
| 2:04:03| And I hope we can all be a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7443)|
| 2:04:05| So I think that evolving process is going to be, we're going to see that over a period of a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7445)|
| 2:04:11| And I just hope we can all rejoice in the parts we've all had in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7451)|
| 2:04:16| But I really do respect everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7456)|
| 2:04:20| Many of you have had to come a long way from some of the original desires that you had for this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7460)|
| 2:04:28| And to see everyone come together and support it in this way is wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7468)|
| 2:04:34| I do feel that there is in place the mechanism for these properties to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7474)|
| 2:04:41| And I truly believe if we can ever just get it kick-started that we're going to see that we do have in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7481)|
| 2:04:48| opportunities for the properties that are in question tonight to be developed in a very meaningful way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7488)|
| 2:04:54| not only for the property owners, but for the overall vision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7494)|
| 2:04:58| So I did want to thank everyone for their participation in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7498)|
| 2:05:03| And I want to thank this council because we've had absolutely an incredible support from the entire council regarding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7503)|
| 2:05:11| And I think most of us have attempted to be as informed and involved as was practical for us to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7511)|
| 2:05:19| So, and Joe, congratulations to you on all the very hard work I know you've been engaged in over this period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7519)|
| 2:05:27| You know, there's a lot of work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| But I see a lot of people out here who are really interested in seeing that it gets done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7529)|
| 2:05:34| Thank you very much for allowing me to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7534)|
| 2:05:36| Councilman Hochquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7536)|
| 2:05:38| I appreciate Councilman Pillow's comments very much, especially the statement that you made about this may very well be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7538)|
| 2:05:45| South Knoxville's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7545)|
| 2:05:48| Somebody could almost make a slogan out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7548)|
| 2:05:52| It's copyrighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7552)|
| 2:05:57| Just a technical observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| As far as the workshop date, I believe it is at the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7559)|
| 2:06:03| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7563)|
| 2:06:06| We'd be scheduled for 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7566)|
| 2:06:08| The Cumberland Avenue, the final Cumberland Avenue process meeting is at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7568)|
| 2:06:12| Mr. Hill mentioned Walter Kulash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7572)|
| 2:06:15| Walter is going to be in town because he's a principal on that team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7575)|
| 2:06:20| and he's also the transportation guy on the South Waterfront team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7580)|
| 2:06:24| So that we can have him at no real charge there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7584)|
| 2:06:29| He's going to be in town anyway, so we're not paying to bring him in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7589)|
| 2:06:33| That was one of Mr. Gill's concerns, which I think is not one to be sloughed off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7593)|
| 2:06:38| But I don't think we can meet any earlier than five because I think KTA meets that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7598)|
| 2:06:46| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7606)|
| 2:06:47| But, anyway, there may be a conflict if we try to meet earlier than five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7607)|
| 2:06:51| But just keep in mind that at 6 o'clock the Cumberland, the final Cumberland meeting starts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7611)|
| 2:06:57| you know, with the presentation of the plan and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7617)|
| 2:07:00| So we'll just have to deal with that as best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7620)|
| 2:07:04| You know, I don't typically comment on land use issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7624)|
| 2:07:07| I feel like that's basically council's purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7627)|
| 2:07:09| But this has been, as everybody knows, probably the biggest priority of our --| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7629)|
| 2:07:13| one of the biggest priorities of our administration for the last two and a half plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7633)|
| 2:07:19| And I just think it's really important that we do comment or I do comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7639)|
| 2:07:23| When I -- I'll be honest with you, in terms of true confessions, this is not how I would have done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7643)|
| 2:07:28| When I first started back getting the south waterfront, I thought, I'll go over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7648)|
| 2:07:31| we'll find some corporate headquarters to get there, and then we'll get a bunch of condominiums built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7651)|
| 2:07:34| and this thing will take off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7654)|
| 2:07:35| And I would have been dead wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7655)|
| 2:07:37| We would have had a process that would have stalled out for a variety of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7657)|
| 2:07:41| And so I'm actually very, very proud of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7661)|
| 2:07:44| I'm thankful for the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7664)|
| 2:07:45| I hate to compliment Dave Hill publicly, but he has done a good job in a lot of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7665)|
| 2:07:55| I'll be honest, I went to the first meeting like a lot of you did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| and then I went out in my car and kind of put my head back in the headrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7678)|
| 2:08:00| and thought, this will never happen because the views were everything from the whole thing should be a butterfly farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7680)|
| 2:08:07| to it should all be industrial forever and ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7687)|
| 2:08:10| And I thought, this will never work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7690)|
| 2:08:12| But we have slogged through and gotten to a process, and everybody keeps using that word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7692)|
| 2:08:17| a plan that I think is a really, really good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7697)|
| 2:08:20| And I would hate to see that ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7700)|
| 2:08:22| I think in the end, and I've told the large property owners, the plan has to win in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7702)|
| 2:08:26| because I think it's a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| That being said, I think the reality is we all see sitting here tonight is for the plan to ultimately win| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7708)|
| 2:08:33| and be implemented, the large property owners are a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7713)|
| 2:08:36| We won't have a river walk without them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7716)|
| 2:08:38| We won't have a bell tower walk, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7718)|
| 2:08:40| And that's going to be the continuing challenge in front of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7720)|
| 2:08:44| Ultimately, it's all going to come back to this council one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7724)|
| 2:08:46| So just be aware that for this to work, ultimately these folks are our partners or it won't ever work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7726)|
| 2:08:53| And that being said, like I said, I think I sense where council is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7733)|
| 2:08:57| I do really, really appreciate the process that's gotten here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7737)|
| 2:09:00| It's been a great one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7740)|
| 2:09:01| And we're on lap one of what's going to be a really long race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7741)|
| 2:09:05| But that first lap has been a hard one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7745)|
| 2:09:07| But let's just not kid ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7747)|
| 2:09:07| We've got some more to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7747)|
| 2:09:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7750)|
| 2:09:11| That being said, are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7751)|
| 2:09:14| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7754)|
| 2:09:15| There's a we're on amendment number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7755)|
| 2:09:18| So we're going to vote for the first amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7758)|
| 2:09:20| Then we'll come back and amend it, vote on the second amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7760)|
| 2:09:22| and then vote on the motion as amended or doubly amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7762)|
| 2:09:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7765)|
| 2:09:26| What is amendment number one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7766)|
| 2:09:28| Amendment one is Mr. Hulkless' amendment to change the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7768)|
| 2:09:32| Amendment two is the gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7772)|
| 2:09:34| The first amendment is the big one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7774)|
| 2:09:36| But, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7776)|
| 2:09:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7777)|
| 2:09:38| Are we straight now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7778)|
| 2:09:39| The motion or the vote is on the motion to amend as made by Mr. Hulkless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7779)|
| 2:09:45| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7785)|
| 2:09:47| Those opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7787)|
| 2:09:49| I heard nine ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7789)|
| 2:09:51| Am I right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7791)|
| 2:09:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7792)|
| 2:09:54| Now we're voting on the second amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7794)|
| 2:09:56| Excuse me, Mr. Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7796)|
| 2:09:57| I actually have to make the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7797)|
| 2:09:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7798)|
| 2:09:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7799)|
| 2:10:01| Use your microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7801)|
| 2:10:02| On 4.1-6, the outdoor space types after gardens, just to put in parenthesis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7802)|
| 2:10:11| including vegetable and fruit gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7811)|
| 2:10:13| I got asked to do this while I was walking in the door for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7813)|
| 2:10:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7819)|
| 2:10:22| That's the motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7822)|
| 2:10:24| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7824)|
| 2:10:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7826)|
| 2:10:27| Second from Ms. Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7827)|
| 2:10:28| Any questions or discussions on the second amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7828)|
| 2:10:33| Straight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7833)|
| 2:10:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7834)|
| 2:10:35| Everybody in favor of the second amendment, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7835)|
| 2:10:37| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7837)|
| 2:10:39| Now, does that include row crops?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7839)|
| 2:10:43| I avoided that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7843)|
| 2:10:46| Get out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7846)|
| 2:10:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7847)|
| 2:10:48| Now we want to vote on the motion as doubly amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7848)|
| 2:10:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7852)|
| 2:10:53| Everybody straight on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7853)|
| 2:10:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7855)|
| 2:10:56| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7856)|
| 2:10:58| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7858)|
| 2:11:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7860)|
| 2:11:05| Now we have to vote on the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7865)|
| 2:11:07| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7867)|
| 2:11:08| Did we vote on the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7868)|
| 2:11:09| I thought we just voted on the second amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7869)|
| 2:11:11| It was the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7871)|
| 2:11:12| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=7872)|
