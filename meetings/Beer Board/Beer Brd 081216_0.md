| 0:08:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| Chairman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| Can I speak to this application just briefly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| I think all of us know from looking at this that this is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| Do they need to stick around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| Didn't get it in quick enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| This application is regarding Wagles' location that has not been built yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=526)|
| 0:08:52| And I did have a discussion with the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| and I think they are well aware that this is pending approval of all the final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=534)|
| 0:09:01| including measurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| And, you know, should conditions change in terms of measurement, which it looks like it's highly unlikely it would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=542)|
| 0:09:09| but in terms of a school or a church or a daycare, that would affect the final approval of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| So this is pending final documentation, but for a number of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| And, Mr. Swanson, is there a statute of limitations on how long an application can be pending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=558)|
| 0:09:24| Well, there's a provision in the code that provides there's a 90-day period from issuance of the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| You could have some argument about what issuance of the permit was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| It also says 90 days unless the board sets some other time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| So if you want to get an estimate from them about how long it's going to take them to get it done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| and rather than have it come back and you have an extension on it, as we do on a number of occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=580)|
| 0:09:47| you could set some other time other than 90 days if that's what you wanted to do under the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| Could you give us an estimate of what you think the time frame will be for completion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| Well, I know once we get the, you know, the bureau, which we've already, which you've approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=596)|
| 0:10:04| then probably anywhere from 180 to 220.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| Until you're ready to open and we can do the fire inspection and the health inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| That being longer than 90 days, I didn't know whether this board wanted to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| and approve an unusual extension of that sort of pending period to account for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=617)|
| 0:10:26| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| Just thinking about the Daniel Shue's circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| and if that applies to the present circumstance with Weigel's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| they have just received a permit pending some final things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| So wouldn't they be first in time in the unlikely scenario something else goes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| which might otherwise disrupt the distance requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=647)|
| 0:10:53| Yes, if they build a church right next door, the bureau permit will already be, have been voted on and have been in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=653)|
| 0:11:00| Actually, they did that by applying for the bureau permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| Once they applied for the bureau permit, they started their time period running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| And so anything that comes in next to that is not going to create a distance problem for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| Councilman Holcomb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| Councilman Peeble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| Well, I was just going to say that understanding the situation that Weigel's is in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| and they have been very up front about they didn't want to actually procure the land unless they were sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=684)|
| 0:11:32| that they could get a bureau permit at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| It seems reasonable to me for us to make some decision tonight regarding an extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=695)|
| 0:11:43| and hopefully they can get it completed within that time and will not have to come back before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=703)|
| 0:11:49| So that would be my thinking, and I'd like to hear from the rest of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| Mr. Chairman, I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| And I was going to ask the Weigel's if that's what you would like us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| Maybe 180 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| Or 20, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| 20, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=724)|
| 0:12:05| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| I just know with the construction, with the weather and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| I know what happens when we start construction and getting building permits and the time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=732)|
| 0:12:20| Councilman Holcomb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| Charles, do we need to reconsider this, or can we just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=742)|
| 0:12:28| I think you can just make a motion to extend the time period to whatever period of time you want it to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| and have that on the record, and I think that will be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| Okay, I'll just go ahead and make a motion to extend this, the full 220 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| or the closest regularly scheduled beer board meeting there and within that period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=762)|
| 0:12:50| Second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| That covers it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| Councilman, Vice Mayor Brown, did you have anything you wanted to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| Councilman Holcomb has actually got to the point I was going to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| One thing I keep hearing daycares mentioned, and I'd like to get Mr. Swanson to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=791)|
| 0:13:17| There is no distance requirement, I think, for a daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| No, the distance requirement is for schools rather than daycares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| That's defined in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| For your consideration tonight, La Costa 31 Market Square was approved subject to final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| At the September 23rd meeting, their 90 days is running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| and we have received a signature card returned from them when they got written notice of this circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=826)|
| 0:13:58| If you do not take action to extend the application, it will expire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| Is anyone here from La Costa?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=844)|
| 0:14:13| I'll return the signature card that they received your mailing notice about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=853)|
| 0:14:21| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| I'll move to extend for another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| In the meantime, is someone going to try to contact them again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| You all will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| Next item is Loperigo on Clinch Avenue, same circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| And we did get the signature card back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| And the location is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| Clinch Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| And the applicant is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| How are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| Could you use your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| My name is Cedric Ward, 416 West Clinch Avenue, Loperigo Restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| We are planning to go on the commission for the building permit at the end of the month right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=912)|
| 0:15:18| We had a problem with our deck on the outside to get the whole permit of the we get the permit from the inside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=918)|
| 0:15:24| but they are valid for only like a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| They did a special derogation for us to open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| But there is problem because of the sidewalk agreement because we put a deck on the outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=930)|
| 0:15:39| and nobody can yet take a decision on the building department to give us the permits yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=939)|
| 0:15:49| So we still don't know exactly what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| We still don't know what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| We're working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| The problem is a deck can only be on the paperwork four feet from the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=957)|
| 0:16:06| And the engineers asked for five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| So but on the paperwork it was four feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| And we are seven feet and a half from the sidewalk, the curb, but there is a tree with mulch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=973)|
| 0:16:21| And they asked us to do a survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| And we did the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| And there's a lot of things we don't even know yet what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| So we're still trying to pass on the front commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| We went through the many commissions so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| And we are waiting and trying to get the thing moving, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| Do you have any idea how much time you might need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| Well, normally it was supposed to be done a month and a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| And we do not know yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| We're just unsure about everything just for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1012)|
| 0:16:58| Councilman Ronnie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| But you are open at this time, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| I didn't want folks to think you weren't open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| No, we are open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| But that's a problem for us because it looks like we're not open because we cannot do anything to our deck right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| We cannot put our awning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| We cannot put, you know, the rail on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| There is a lot of things, you know, like that where we cannot even touch anything outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| I'll move an extension to the February beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| Yes, I'm in support of the extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| I just want to note that the deck apparently got billed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| It wasn't included in the permit because we hadn't approved, what do we call it, special easement, special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1058)|
| 0:17:46| whatever, like we do on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| None of that ever happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| And so we approved the beer permit, but none of that other, that wasn't brought before city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1070)|
| 0:17:57| And so that's the pickle they're in, and that's the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1077)|
| 0:18:04| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| All in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| The next item is Margarita's Mexican Restaurant at 8088 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| This is an application to add dancing to an existing beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| And they were approved at the September 33rd meeting, and evidently they are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1105)|
| 0:18:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| This is Hector William from 8088 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| We are asking for a few more weeks or maybe 30 days more for extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1119)|
| 0:18:47| We plan to do the sprinkles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| We still work on the sprinkles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| It's going to be done maybe in one week or ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| But we don't want to take the chance because we're waiting for inspection for the fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| And if anything coming out, we kind of need, like, 30 or 60 days extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1139)|
| 0:19:10| I move we give them a 30-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1155)|
| 0:19:15| It's a 30 or 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| I think he's going to a 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| So would you like to settle on a number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| I say 60, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| I move a 60-day extension be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| I just want to point out that you'll need to know if you're going to need a further extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| you'd come in at the next, not the next beer board meeting, but the one after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| which is a little less than 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| So you just need to keep that date in mind, whatever date that is, if you were to need another extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| Council Member Pelo might consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| You might change that to an extension to the February meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| and it will just be on the February meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| Thank you, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| I didn't think quickly enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| I move that the extension be granted until the February beer board meeting, which is the fourth week in the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1202)|
| 0:20:13| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1213)|
| 0:20:19| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| Thanks, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| Then the next group have been previously brought to you for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| First is Farm at 1204 North Central Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| They've had five 30-day extensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| and we just granted another beer permit application subject to final documentation tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| So does that become moot, the farm application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| If you don't do anything, it goes away, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| You said there's more than one permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| If we, now that we've granted that one subject to final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| there's more than one permit for the same address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| Well, there's an application, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| And they were both subject to final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1266)|
| 0:21:15| Under the current circumstances, first one in with documentation gets a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| Maybe we ought to let Mr. Hsu explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| Unless we take no action further extending, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| And there's only one pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| Daniel Hsu, 1204 North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| And I guess I'd just like to rescind the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| Withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| Withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| Withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| The farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| We'll be clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| You're putting it out to pasture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| Farming it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| We apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1308)|
| 0:21:58| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| Don't go too far, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| Next, Happy Holler Diner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| Again, several extensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| Mr. Hsu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| Happy Holler Diner, 1208 North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| We still plan on moving forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| I was up in the building department today looking over the plans there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1337)|
| 0:22:23| And probably another 60 days we can get things done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| The base has been completed for the mercantile operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1347)|
| 0:22:34| So we're working to finish the kitchen up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| and hopefully have it open in 60 days or so with the revised market economics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1358)|
| 0:22:46| It's taking a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| Plain and safe move to give them an extension until the March beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1368)|
| 0:22:56| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| Opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| And finally, Wingstop 8857 Town and Country Circle were approved October 31st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1385)|
| 0:23:11| and you were granted a 30-day extension at your November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| My name is Lisa Miller, 8857 Town and Country Circle, Knoxville 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1396)|
| 0:23:24| And I'm here to ask for another extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| We're scheduled to open on the 7th pending our health department inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1407)|
| 0:23:35| which I've had to order parts for the beer cooler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| And I have to wait five to seven days for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| You indicated you're ready to open on the 7th of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| We'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| A motion to extend to the January meeting would be appropriate if that's what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| Which would be the end of January, you understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| So is that to tell me that as long as I have everything done, I don't have to come to the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| Well, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| That's to tell you you cannot serve beer until.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| Right, until everything is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| But I don't have to show up for the meeting if I already get my permit, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| Well, I move that the extension be granted for until the January beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1475)|

| 0:24:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1480)|
| 0:24:47| Mr. Lewis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1487)|
| 0:25:02| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| Bowen Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| It's 1198 East Magnolia Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| We need a final business tax return from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| Local group pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| I think Officer Husky would like to address us on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| I've passed out the open container ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| I'll put one on each of you's desks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| You could pull that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| I want to go over section three of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| The reason we wanted to address the beer board is this is coming from the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| It's on game days, the open container issues that, I guess, flood the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1552)|
| 0:25:59| It was talked about through KPD earlier in the season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| but we decided to wait until the end of the year so we can get out some notices at the first of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| to the businesses and parking lot owners that we can reach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| Number three on the ordinance there is possess an open container of beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| or consume beer on any privately owned parking lot held open to use by the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| Our main concern when we first brought this up was the Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| You have all the open businesses that are just flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| The parking lots are flooded with people sitting there drinking beer from the night before until the night after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| We wanted to let you all know that it's our position as the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| is we're going to start enforcing this ordinance the next football game next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| But we're going to give out notices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| We're going to mail notices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| We're going to hand deliver notices to all the places that have beer permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| and sell alcohol on the strip and anywhere else that we can think of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| Chief Owen is going to do a press conference a couple of weeks before the first game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| so we can get out some notices because I know the folks probably lease out a lot of their spots early in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| That's why we want to get out letters to them January 1st of the year and get the word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| But we want to know if you all had any questions or concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| And hopefully I can answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| I can get you the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| Councilman Romney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| Officer Husky, the number four on this relating to the Knoxville Zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1646)|
| 0:27:34| I assume this does not cover when they have a special permit for special events after hours like Zoofari| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1654)|
| 0:27:40| or Feast with the Beast, that kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| Yes, they get that special permit just so they can have it during.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| And so that circumvents the open air provision for that public park for that particular use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1665)|
| 0:27:52| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| Doesn't 4D cover that on this ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| I was wondering about a couple of those, but 4D kind of covers that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| It sounds like it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| I just wanted to clarify for certain because I know those two fundraisers are very significant to the Knoxville Zoo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| and there may be other organizations that have special events on city public grounds, parks, or facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1691)|
| 0:28:20| And so if a special permit is issued via the Spear Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| then that sort of nullifies the open container for that specific event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| Like on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| Like on Gate Street or something, if they get a special permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| I was wondering the same thing because I was trying to think about other instances at Jehovah Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| Well, there's other nonprofits that utilize Market Square for that kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| and it's significant to them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1726)|
| 0:28:52| This would apply not just to Cumberland Avenue and football games,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| but obviously anywhere in the city, including all of Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1736)|
| 0:29:02| anytime, parties in front yards, keg parties, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| Well, it would be, it's a privately owned parking lot held open use by the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1746)|
| 0:29:13| So I would tell you that if you're in your front yard, that you can have a beer in your front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1753)|
| 0:29:21| It's for if you're parking cars in a parking lot held open use by the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1761)|
| 0:29:28| So if you're going to outlaw front yard parking, then that would no longer be a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| Right now, some of them are parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| Some of them turn them into parking lots on game days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| And other times, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| Yes, sir, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| If you see cars parked in the front yard, then they're fair game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| And some of that may be up to interpretation of Judge Rawson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| and I have met with the judge Monday and asked him some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| and got his opinion on some of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| But it's pretty much, you know, he's going to read it for what it is he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| If it's privately owned, and I'll give you, for instance, take an apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1803)|
| 0:30:10| If you've got a parking lot that's fenced off, it's got signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| if you park here your vehicle will be towed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| If you go ask that apartment manager, that is a private lot not open to use by the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| It's for residents and guests only because you have to have a parking permit to park there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| That same apartment complex may have a parking lot next to their office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| that will have spots that will say future residents, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| You could pull in there 24 hours a day and get brochures off of the front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1834)|
| 0:30:41| We would view that parking lot as open to use by the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| and that's a for instance that I give the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| So it's kind of a, I don't want to say it's a lot-by-lot basis, but some of it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1848)|
| 0:30:55| But for sure the businesses that are open, and if we just talk about businesses right off the bat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| there is numerous businesses that are open, yet there's alcohol being consumed in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| And even beer permit establishments that allow to drink in a parking lot that are open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1865)|
| 0:31:13| Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| Well, I just wanted to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| Now, private individuals often open their yards to public parking on game day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1876)|
| 0:31:24| and the same thing happens with Chilhowee Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| And I believe that we can consider an ordinance which has exceptions for those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1888)|
| 0:31:36| But when I read this, I read this to apply that if it's open to the public to pay to park there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1896)|
| 0:31:46| that it would then be public parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| That's, if, I can give you my opinion, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| Well, I know what my opinion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| I'm actually coming down to the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| And that obviously is options if you wanted to, as council, reword or do something to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1918)|
| 0:32:05| I mean, we're not opposed to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| We just want to let you all know because it's going to create some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| And personally, I have no objection to it applying to those parking lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| which are really private residents' front yards or back yards or side yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| And so I just wanted to make you aware that that may be something that's going to be changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1943)|
| 0:32:30| and have to be clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| And I did mention to the judge about the lots, the yards being turned into parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| And, you know, from what we can see, I don't see where a parking lot is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1957)|
| 0:32:43| It's got to be paved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| It's got to have gravel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| I mean, until there's something more definite, I think it applies as how it reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1965)|
| 0:32:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| So, Officer Husky, let me ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| I mean, if you have a parking lot, not so hypothetically speaking, over at the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1979)|
| 0:33:05| that, you know, Monday through Friday is student parking only, whether it's for commuters or non-commuters or staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1985)|
| 0:33:12| and people are paying to park in those lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1992)|
| 0:33:18| If you're in the parking lot next to Thompson Bowling Arena, you know, I've been told that people will drink alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=1998)|
| 0:33:29| Are you all going to enforce that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| I would say that we're going to contact UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| UT property is UT property, and they have their own police force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| And I'm not telling you that we're going to go into their property and enforce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| They usually handle all their misdemeanor citations and arrests themselves on their own property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2024)|
| 0:33:50| It's probably their policy that there's no alcohol allowed on UT property, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2030)|
| 0:33:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| Is there any other business that needs to come before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| Do you want to just mention the lunch meeting that we had and fill people in on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| I mean, it felt like it was a good discussion with the Metropolitan Drug Commission, and several members missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| Do you want to just, Mr. Chairman, fill us in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| Well, since you're just more than glad to let you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| I was thinking the quickly part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| You're so much more qualified at it than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| Mr. Becker, we could call on the executive director of the Metropolitan Drug Commission to give the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| Is she?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| Well, what an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| Yeah, that's better than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| Come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| Boy, I saw the light bulb go off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| But actually, brother, it's good how you took it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| Could you come to the mic, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| No, I think you could do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| Could you come to the mic, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| Give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| Catherine Branson, 9413 Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| And I really would actually love to hear your perspective of how you thought it went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| So you brought it up, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| I think you take the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2104)|
| 0:35:10| The quickly will, of course, fall by the wayside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| Meeting today, Metropolitan Drug Commission at lunch talked about the sort of a follow-up on the recent beer sting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2113)|
| 0:35:20| where over half the facilities visited failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| And a focus on the on-premise, the restaurant, the bars, and how they deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2124)|
| 0:35:30| Heard from a couple owners of restaurants and some of their issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| I think it was a good move for getting them at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| Information about how they view the problem that can be helpful in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2138)|
| 0:35:45| I think as far as actions of the beer board, well, as far as actions of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2145)|
| 0:35:52| there was some discussion about the value of KPD doing a little more outreach training with servers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2152)|
| 0:35:59| which some of the owners seemed interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| And the other part is there was some discussion and some interest in the idea of extending the requiring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| showing an ID for purchases to on-premise as well as off-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| That seemed to have a lot of support around the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| And I think the restaurant people are going to talk to some of the compadres about how that might fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2176)|
| 0:36:23| So I think that's about what I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| And Ms. Roddy has her light on, so she might have stuff to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| I just want to publicly thank the Metropolitan Drug Commission for providing this open policy discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2191)|
| 0:36:37| A large number of people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| The county beer board was invited as well as our participation from KPD and from the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| We had folks there from the Attorney General's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| So it was a good mix of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| One of the things that I heard from one of the restaurant representatives was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| and this was very rewarding to hear, was that when they do training directly with the Knoxville Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| it seems to have a much bigger impact on their servers than when they do the hired training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| And I didn't really understand that, but there are, what, contract folks, Officer Huskey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| that can come in and do your annual updates or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| The Alcohol Beverage Commission approves the training program, and there's other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| I know of one other one that has their program approved, and it's called something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2235)|
| 0:37:23| Ours is called TASC, Tennessee Alcohol Server Knowledge, because that's the program that we choose to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| We can come up with our own program and get it certified and teach our own, but we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| ours is another state program also, but we have KPD officers that teach ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2253)|
| 0:37:39| And it was rewarding to hear that they're doing a good job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| and particularly the incidents and stories that they're able to illustrate their training with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2262)|
| 0:37:48| makes the training much more relevant to the servers than folks that actually aren't on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| and experiencing some of these kinds of situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| And I'll agree with Councilman Becker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| it was rewarding to hear the folks from the restaurants were a little more receptive to working with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| and with the state to try to come up with some new ideas that might impact their level of compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2283)|
| 0:38:14| Councilman Hoquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| Just going back to the specific thing that Councilman Becker mentioned at the end of his very brief remarks, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2295)|
| 0:38:24| The idea of carding on-premise also, looking at the Blount County model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| which allows the server to, if there's a question or if the person does not have their ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2310)|
| 0:38:41| then the server can get the manager and the manager can waive that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| And that's a safety valve kind of a thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| and I think that's something we had not considered before when we approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| and then backed off of requiring it for on-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| I think that's something I wanted to mention that for those of you that weren't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2336)|
| 0:39:05| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| Following up on that, I'm glad you made that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| because the stipulation was that there was a manager override system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| I asked Officer Husky the handouts, the data from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| Hopefully you all got one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| Minutes have already been sent to you from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| And I will follow up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| I would like to make one point that I made today that doesn't directly relate to the restaurant piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2363)|
| 0:39:30| When we have remedial hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| one of the points I brought up today that I've been meaning to bring up for quite some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| I think we've sent the message that the plan is, well, I fired that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| And I just want to share with you, there's a lot of research that shows that's a really bad plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| And that's not the message I think we should be sending the restaurant owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| If they fail a second time, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| But the first time, they are far more likely to be more vigilant in checking the next time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| than someone who's never had their hands slapped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| And so I think it's really important that we don't send the message that what we want to hear from you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| is you fired your employee because it's a bad business practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| But I thank all of you for coming today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| And I will follow up with the restaurants and the folks that weren't here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| if we can get a little more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| And Ms. Brunson, does the research show that that is an ineffective business practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| both for off-premise and on-premise servers or just on-premise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| Because we focused on on-premise today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| It is a bad business practice, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| Can you tell me again what the research is saying as to why that is a bad business practice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2434)|
| 0:40:40| Or is it a bad business practice or is it not an effective business practice as a deterrent for these violations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2440)|
| 0:40:48| The second of that might have been the more effective way of wording it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| It's not an effective strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| You know, with DUIs, 87% of our DUIs are one-time DUIs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| People do learn their lesson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| And a person that's had their hands slapped and had to go to court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| and face their owner, you know, for having failed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| is more likely to be vigilant in the future than someone who's kicked out the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| and runs down to the next place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2469)|
| 0:41:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| Is there any other business that's come before the Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| I hear a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| It's been adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081216?start=2485)|
