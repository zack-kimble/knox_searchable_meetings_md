| 0:00:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2)|
| 0:00:30| Well, everyone, we will start our meeting with a moment of silence and the Pledge of Allegiance led by Miss Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=30)|
| 0:00:52| Now for the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=52)|
| 0:00:57| I pledge allegiance to the flag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=57)|
| 0:01:10| for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=70)|
| 0:01:22| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=82)|
| 0:01:24| Welcome, everyone, who is all our board members and our staff in attendance on the screen and also those who are watching by live stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=84)|
| 0:01:34| As I've stated in our last few meetings, we know that this electronic format does create some challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=94)|
| 0:01:42| And one of them is the inability for us to hold public forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=102)|
| 0:01:46| So we do have a an email address that's been set up, boardcomments at knoxschools.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=106)|
| 0:01:53| So if you're watching and you have comments that you would like to share with all board members at the same time, please use that email address and it will be sent to each board member immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=113)|
| 0:02:09| And as you may be aware, we tentatively had a called meeting that was scheduled for Wednesday, May 20th to consider the fiscal year 2021 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=129)|
| 0:02:20| We will be delaying that meeting until Wednesday, May 27th at 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=140)|
| 0:02:25| And this will allow our finance team to hopefully receive the March sales tax figures and just have as much up to date information as possible as we consider the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=145)|
| 0:02:37| So as we get closer to that date, we will announce the venue and other information as soon as it's confirmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=157)|
| 0:02:44| I wanted to give a quick update on our student representative selection committee, the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=164)|
| 0:02:52| I wanted to give you an update on that process. It's been affected due to our school closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=172)|
| 0:02:59| So the original deadline for the student applications was March 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=179)|
| 0:03:04| And so when school closed, that deadline was changed to April 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=184)|
| 0:03:09| And then with the with the second school closure, the time was extended and the information was shared again with principals and school counselors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=189)|
| 0:03:18| And the date was extended until May 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| We have now received. So by May 1st, we received 17 applications and those have been redacted and given to the selection committee, which consists of secondary education executive director, Danny Trance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=201)|
| 0:03:38| Our current student representative, Noah Kelly, principal, Brad Coram, community member, Angela Fisher and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=218)|
| 0:03:46| We will be reviewing the applications and meeting over the next couple of weeks and then completing interviews of the top candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=226)|
| 0:03:53| We plan to announce the student representative at one of our June board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=233)|
| 0:03:59| And speaking of our student representative, I know last week this was kind of mentioned, but I wanted to just take a moment to recognize Noah Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=239)|
| 0:04:08| Noah is the valedictorian at Karnes High School. And so, Noah, I know I speak for the rest of the board members also when I just say congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=248)|
| 0:04:17| We're so proud of you and all your accomplishments, and we can't wait to see the wonderful things you do in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=257)|
| 0:04:24| And you'll have to be sure to stay in touch so we know how things are going. So congratulations again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=264)|
| 0:04:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| And I'm going to turn now to Superintendent Thomas to ask if you have any announcements or information you'd like to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=274)|
| 0:04:43| Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board. I'll take just a few minutes to address graduation, just to update you just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=283)|
| 0:04:51| Since we met last week, we've heard from you, obviously, our families, our community, and I want to emphasize that we want what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=291)|
| 0:04:59| We would love nothing more than for our seniors to have a graduation celebration that they can be excited about while doing our part to keep our community safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=299)|
| 0:05:07| Earlier this week, we requested a meeting with Mayor Jacobs, and this morning, members of my staff and I met with Mayor Jacobs and Commissioner Justin Biggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=307)|
| 0:05:16| and we presented our initial graduation plan, which we drafted in April, which was prior to the announced COVID-19 reopening phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=316)|
| 0:05:24| Both Mayor Jacobs and Commissioner Biggs are in full support of our initial plan, which calls for ceremonies in June, allows for a limited number of guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=324)|
| 0:05:33| As of right now, we would begin graduation ceremonies the week of June 8th, and they would extend through June 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=333)|
| 0:05:39| just to give families some idea about the timeframe, and we'll be announcing more information soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=339)|
| 0:05:45| We're still working on the details, and again, we'll share all of that information as soon as they're finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=345)|
| 0:05:51| We know that some guests may not feel comfortable attending, so we'll be live streaming and recording these events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| For those who attend, the expectation will be that they follow physical distancing, wear a mask, and other precautionary guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=357)|
| 0:06:04| We hope this provides some comfort to our students and families, but also knowing that depending on the spread of COVID-19, these plans could change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=364)|
| 0:06:12| Again, we'll be sharing more information soon, and again, I'd just like to thank Mayor Jacobs and also Commissioner Biggs for their full support of this plan for our seniors and their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=372)|
| 0:06:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| Thank you, Superintendent Freeman, for that update, and we'll just continue to hope that all the numbers stay low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=389)|
| 0:06:40| Okay, members, you were contacted this afternoon regarding deferring Agenda Item 8D, which was a purchase agreement for property located at Coward Mill Road for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=400)|
| 0:06:53| and Superintendent Thomas and I have agreed to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| I believe that Jim Snowden, our Director of Public Works and Engineering, is on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=416)|
| 0:07:02| Mr. Snowden, would you like to make any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=422)|
| 0:07:08| Yes, Madam Chair, I appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| We support this. We appreciate the Superintendent and you allowing us to take 30 days and complete a traffic study so that we can look a little closer at some of the impacts to the Coward Mill Road to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=432)|
| 0:07:27| and how that may affect our upcoming Cherahala project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| We think that there may not be a great number of improvements that may need to be needed, but we would like to categorize those and accurately determine their costs before that is purchased so that we could best serve the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=451)|
| 0:07:46| So we appreciate that and certainly would appreciate your support of that deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| Great. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| So that item will be deferred for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| Okay. Do we have any other requested changes to this agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=480)|
| 0:08:07| Do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=487)|

| 0:08:19| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| Okay, and as a reminder, we will maintain the same voting methods that we used during our April meeting and this is cumbersome, but we will have a show of hands on consent agenda items and then on all other items we will have a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=501)|
| 0:08:42| And Ms. Coatney will take us through that and it is a little tedious, but Ms. Coatney, take it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=522)|
| 0:08:51| Item 5, consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=531)|
| 0:08:58| Do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=538)|

| 0:09:49| Okay, I got blocked out. I was, if you already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=589)|
| 0:09:55| I apologize. I was out and then I just the second got in so I missed that little sequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| That's okay. Okay, we'll come back to that Ms. Hill. Right. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| Would that be the correct thing? We'll go ahead and vote on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=607)|

| 0:10:23| Hey, motion carries. Okay. Now, since Miss Hill was blocked, her signal was blocked a little bit. You had to change to the agenda, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=623)|
| 0:10:32| I do and I apologize for that. Yes, I'd like to propose that into the end of agenda that we have a discussion and possible vote on the format that we use for our budget meeting location time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=632)|
| 0:10:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| So we have a first by Miss Hill and a second by Mr Norman. Do we have other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=652)|

| 0:21:03| Ms. Owen. I still have some concerns about the number of devices that we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1263)|
| 0:21:10| since we still have several with two years of support. It seems to me that since we don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1270)|
| 0:21:22| a funding source yet where this money is going to come from in the future that it would be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1282)|
| 0:21:27| responsible to look at a lower number until we are in a better financial situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1287)|
| 0:21:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| Mr. Thomas would anyone like to address that issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| Yes ma'am. And again we can whatever the pleasure of the board is we you know we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1310)|
| 0:21:57| we think we would space out the purchases we do have devices with with time left on them support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| left on them so we would want to get the maximum use out of those devices that we have so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1322)|
| 0:22:09| our thought level and Ms. Byard can can jump in and correct me if I'm wrong on this but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| what we thought too is let's take into consideration the time the remaining on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| devices and not purchase everything at the same time and space those purchases out which would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| help us financially too but you know my thought too is we would go ahead and approve this and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1344)|
| 0:22:31| think we can come back to the board at whatever time before we do anything and make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| that all board members are comfortable with the you know the numbers that we're we're purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| and how we can space that out so that we can get the maximum support out of all devices that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1361)|
| 0:22:47| that we currently have. And Madam Chair, Ms. Byard may want to correct me if I'm wrong on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1367)|
| 0:22:56| anything there. Okay would you like to jump in Ms. Byard before we move to another board member?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1376)|
| 0:23:03| Just a couple of comments. Mr. Thomas is exactly correct. I think Mr. McPherson has actually been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1383)|
| 0:23:09| working with our federal programs director to discuss that very concept. I want to emphasize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1389)|
| 0:23:17| that the plan contemplates buying a Chromebook for every student but it does not specify the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1397)|
| 0:23:25| exact date of that purchase. So I think Mr. Thomas is correct as we need to look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| the staging if you will of those those purchases. Mr. McPherson may want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| add more to that. I think he has some late breaking info on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| I don't see him. Mr. McPherson would you like to weigh in on that please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| Yes, Mr. Byard's correct. So Cheryl Martin has been working with the state on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1425)|
| 0:23:54| you know maybe how we can utilize these how we can deploy the devices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1434)|
| 0:24:01| extend the life of the newer devices while also not endangering our compliance with ESSA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1441)|
| 0:24:10| And so that's something we always have to keep our eyes on because a number of our Title I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1450)|
| 0:24:17| schools have used Title I funds to purchase newer devices. So we have to be careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1457)|
| 0:24:25| in this plan to not exclude any students because otherwise we get into a situation of supplanting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1465)|
| 0:24:32| rather than supplementing. So what we will do is continue to work with the state to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1472)|
| 0:24:39| that we are in compliance while also extending the life of those newer devices. So it won't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| that we're excluding anyone. It's just a matter of how we can you know get the best bang for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| buck so to speak. Okay Ms. Irwin do you have any follow-up comment or question? Okay Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1488)|
| 0:25:00| So I appreciate what the thorough thought of going back and looking at some things. So thank you so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1500)|
| 0:25:07| much for that Superintendent Thomas. How do we vote on that notion that we will what you said at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| the like spreading out the cost because the plan doesn't say that. It's like it's not laid out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| and like when it will be purchased. And I think that's where the confusion might be coming and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| that's where the community might not fully understand that we're purchasing how we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| purchasing. So I would rather vote on something that clearly states what the plan is and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| phasing approach versus $60,000 all at once. Because I support us going one-to-one but I also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1536)|
| 0:25:42| support it phasing out in the process. I'll certainly yield to Mr. Thomas but I'll jump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1542)|
| 0:25:49| in here if I if I can. I think we you know we also have we also have to have our eyes on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| the lease purchase agreement. So you know we have to right now what we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1555)|
| 0:26:04| is a $21 million investment spread out over three years. So I want to be I want to be careful and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1564)|
| 0:26:11| not necessarily overcome that in the sense that we're going to necessarily save money on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1571)|
| 0:26:18| front end. Where I think that the fact that we can purchase these devices if we can stagger the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1578)|
| 0:26:25| purchase what it really does I think is creates the possibility that we save money as we roll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1585)|
| 0:26:31| into future years. Because what we have done is extend the life of those newer devices. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| the whereas the expectation may be if we purchase a device on day one and we have a five-year life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| if we can extend the life of the newer devices we continue to those over a two years for the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| two years then conceivably we purchase those devices two years from now. And so what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1608)|
| 0:26:55| is is those devices are still in use by the time we roll around for potentially a new lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1615)|
| 0:27:02| as we roll through the the as we sustain the plan. So I want to make sure it's where the where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| savings comes in at at least on the surface the way it looks where the same come in at is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1628)|
| 0:27:15| we're not in year five or year six we're not looking at buying another $60,000 worth of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1635)|
| 0:27:20| devices because we we have devices in use at that time that are still operable. Gail did I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1640)|
| 0:27:27| did I say that accurately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1647)|
| 0:27:36| Sorry I think so Ron. I think just to to simplify it as much as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1656)|
| 0:27:43| we are looking at a $7 million annual budget and as Ron said it's really a $15 million device| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1663)|
| 0:27:53| purchase and then there's some other support items in that in that budget. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1673)|
| 0:28:00| what we're what we're looking at right now as far as the board's concerned there's not a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| to buy these devices there's a an available state contract where we can purchase and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| purchased and we've vetted that through Knox County Purchasing. What we're asking the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| to consider and to approve is the plan and the expenditure of the CARES Act funds to support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1695)|
| 0:28:24| and then we're going to have to work out the the nitty-gritty details if you will of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1704)|
| 0:28:30| how many devices goes to each each school and so forth and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| We're looking at a budget for 60,000 devices to cover all of our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1714)|
| 0:28:41| but not every student will get a device on day one that is out of this pocket of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1721)|
| 0:28:48| We will as Ron tried to explain I think be spreading that over the course of maybe two fiscal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| years. I don't know how to answer your question better Evedy is that is that the answer? No that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1733)|
| 0:29:00| exactly what I want to hear at the inception but I guess I was just going digging deeper but that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1740)|
| 0:29:08| that's exactly what I'm hoping is that we're not buying 60,000 today and giving them out when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| already have 40,000 in place but we're using that money. It was a lack of my understanding of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| that plan really means. That's a good question and it made us go back and look and in very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| detail so this one. So Ron you had mentioned so two questions you had mentioned that in year four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1764)|
| 0:29:32| and five we may we may spread this purchase out over year four and five. Would that be the result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1772)|
| 0:29:39| of this so if you go back to principals and we only need to purchase 40,000 units at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1779)|
| 0:29:47| then that that that would shift those funds forward is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1787)|
| 0:29:54| That's what we're still working through the details I think so what what we would be committing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1794)|
| 0:30:00| if we go one-to-one let me let me say it this way if we go one-to-one we have to have a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| where we're committing a device for every student in the in Knox County otherwise we would we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1804)|
| 0:30:10| be supplanting. Okay. What what happens is is is if we purchase these devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1810)|
| 0:30:17| oh let's say in the next let's say a year from now or two years from now we purchase the device| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1817)|
| 0:30:23| for those schools uh that today have newer devices but two years from now then we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1823)|
| 0:30:29| strategically make the purchase at that time. The issue would be if we're already into a lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1829)|
| 0:30:35| agreement uh that we have those lease payment obligations but where I think the advantage for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1835)|
| 0:30:41| us comes in is we have every school on a plan uh and then so presumably if if we bought all of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1841)|
| 0:30:49| devices on day one then at the beginning of year six we have to purchase 60,000 devices in in if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1849)|
| 0:30:56| can stagger these purchases so to speak that gives us the ability I believe that in five years from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1856)|
| 0:31:04| now uh what's happening is uh we can we are we actually have devices that are currently in use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1864)|
| 0:31:12| from the first plan rather than than purchasing another 60,000 devices and we we have a we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| a plan that the feds are signing off on whereas it's it's a sustainable top plan so I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1877)|
| 0:31:24| some of the details we have to work through the one thing we're we're absolutely conscious of is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| that we have schools out there with newer devices we understand that we need to take advantage of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| the lifespan of those devices we also want to be financially responsible obviously with with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| lease um and so that's why we I think we have to you know work carefully with the state to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1900)|
| 0:31:47| sure that the state is is uh is okay with how we are rolling this plan out so I think there's two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1907)|
| 0:31:55| there's there's two things at stake here that we can extend the life or take advantage of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1915)|
| 0:32:01| useful life of the devices we we have currently while also not violating ESSA requirements and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| there's the potential for monetary savings down the road so I want to be careful and not uh over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| over commit with with details that we haven't worked out yet but these are issues that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| keenly aware of as we go through this process I just think we have to be careful that if we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| going to commit to it if the district commits to a one-to-one device for all students we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| have a plan where all students will eventually receive a new device if that makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1948)|
| 0:32:37| okay I hope that was helpful thank you that's helpful yeah I do support us going one-to-one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1957)|
| 0:32:44| especially now that I see like California schools colleges are not going to go back in the fall and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| just the potential if we have to go online having a plan I guess I'm going to go and it maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| reiterates um miss Satterfield's concern is with what we were voting on is what was presented to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1974)|
| 0:33:04| is that are we are we talking about the same thing I mean because sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| that's what I'm a little concerned about is I mean I support the plan but the way the attachment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| was very specifically about certain things and I just want to make sure we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| we're voting on what's correct that we're now negotiating and stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=1997)|
| 0:33:25| I mean do you feel like the way it's laid out is fine to vote on and we'll give you all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| flexibility to work with the federal government on what you need to do I believe so uh Gail are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2008)|
| 0:33:35| you are you how do you I mean I am but um yield or chief technology and Cheryl I don't know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2015)|
| 0:33:43| Cheryl's on this um on here or not but it if so I'd welcome her to speak into it again I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| sure if she is or not but yeah and and I'm Miss Babb I apologize sometimes I think we're we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2028)|
| 0:33:55| talking with marbles in our mouth but um I do believe that the plan as it was laid out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2035)|
| 0:34:01| and the budget dollars as they are laid out is exactly what we're still talking about the change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| that we've made as a response to board questions and comments is to extend and sort of smooth or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2047)|
| 0:34:15| create some sustainability in the plan uh based on the fact that we do have some modern devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2055)|
| 0:34:21| out there in our schools right now and not um taking the that complete 60,000 step on day one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2061)|
| 0:34:28| so but I do think the plan is still the same it's just that we've extended if you can imagine a Gantt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| chart we've extended the lines out some further yeah and and I'll I'll jump in oh I'm sorry Miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2073)|
| 0:34:39| Satterfield okay okay and and so Cheryl even just this afternoon uh preliminary indications are that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2079)|
| 0:34:46| the state uh uh approve um our staggered rollout whatever that looks like so our concern that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2086)|
| 0:34:55| why we were a little bit hesitant um you know initially is this is this is what we believe we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2095)|
| 0:35:01| can do and so we've gotten some pretty good news from the state today uh that that as long as our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2101)|
| 0:35:07| plan I think addresses all students I think we have flexibility in how we roll it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2107)|
| 0:35:14| right yeah that's okay Miss Satterfield so what language can we put in our vote that we're about to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2114)|
| 0:35:21| um cast to ensure that what you're sharing with us now is what actually happens are we just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2121)|
| 0:35:29| operate off state you can you can offer a substitute motion okay you put me to work okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2129)|
| 0:35:40| no pressure okay um a couple I'll tell you what I have a couple other questions that I would just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| like to ask because I know we've we've all heard um these questions from our community so Miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| Satterfield if you want to think about that for a moment and let me just ask a couple of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| that some of the rest of you may have and I think we've all kind of gotten these answers but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| just for the benefit of those watching could we have two things that I have listed to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| one would be the issue of um of the internet connection for students who may not have it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2168)|
| 0:36:15| then secondly um if we can have Shannon or Teresa talk about the teacher training piece of it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2175)|
| 0:36:24| what the what the plans are for for those things so um if we could talk about the wi-fi first would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2184)|
| 0:36:31| that be Dr. Ryslick or Gail um I'll take a stab at the wi-fi and Russ Oaks has been involved um in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2191)|
| 0:36:41| our conversations as well as Tammy Campbell and the staff um we are working with a committee with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2201)|
| 0:36:49| the Knoxville chamber to um address those concerns around families that do not have internet access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2209)|
| 0:36:56| in the home our first step is conducting a survey and we met this morning with our research and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2216)|
| 0:37:02| evaluation uh group Steve Reuters group and determine next steps to um sort of collect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2222)|
| 0:37:09| some information across the district where we have um inaccessibility where we have um either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2229)|
| 0:37:17| broadband issues or financial issues that are keeping families from having access at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2237)|
| 0:37:23| so based on that information um we have a committee meeting with um our chamber partners at uh on June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2243)|
| 0:37:30| 9th I believe it is to discuss how our community can help support um and um address those needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2250)|
| 0:37:38| and I'm sure we'll be taking next steps from there but we've had several parties uh indicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2258)|
| 0:37:44| interest in uh in helping us with that challenge okay great any questions on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2264)|
| 0:37:53| okay and then the teacher training piece Shannon would you like to take that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2273)|
| 0:37:59| sure I would be happy to thank you so we released um a canvas course yesterday actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2279)|
| 0:38:06| it is a level one entry-level training it is something that that teachers can opt in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2286)|
| 0:38:15| during the month of May and it is a an intro to campus for those who've never used canvas before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2295)|
| 0:38:23| and then it is also for veteran teachers we worked with a group of our teachers who use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| canvas very frequently they're really good about making changes in the background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| and so the veteran teachers were giving them support around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2314)|

| 0:44:14| but given the times we live in I mean we don't even know our revenue sources and what we do know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2654)|
| 0:44:23| is that this purchase is going to increase our budget now we're we're reacting to an unusual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2663)|

| 0:44:44| deal about elementary anyway and so I think we're biting off a lot of debt that we don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2684)|
| 0:44:56| how we're going to be able to fund this in the future so that's kind of my issue thanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2696)|
| 0:45:02| Mr. McMillan along the same lines what you were saying Mr. Norman I think you do have a lot of faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2702)|
| 0:45:13| if you follow this but is Ron still around I have a couple of questions that I would like to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2713)|
| 0:45:24| I would like to ask Ron are you still there? Sure I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2724)|
| 0:45:38| It's where is it 12 and a half million that we're gonna get it's it's probably more it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2738)|
| 0:45:48| between 12.8 and 12.9 so it's closer to around 12.9 okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2748)|
| 0:45:57| now when are we gonna get that money and are we gonna get it all at one time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2757)|
| 0:46:06| So Cheryl Martin our federal programs director she's she's oh I think I see Cheryl I may let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2766)|
| 0:46:14| her respond to that as far as because I think it's on a reimbursable basis but I'm gonna let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2774)|
| 0:46:20| Cheryl if you don't mind Cheryl to more intelligently than I could on that so Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2780)|
| 0:46:26| McMillan what we know at this time the guidance at this time is that these dollars the cares dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2786)|
| 0:46:34| will be a reimbursable so it's it's it'll be a draw so the money will be spent and then it'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2794)|
| 0:46:42| be a reimbursable draw every quarter and then to your point the question you asked just a minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2802)|
| 0:46:49| ago so Knox County should be getting about 12.9 million dollars but we also have to serve our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2809)|
| 0:46:58| non-public school students and our charter school out of those funds as well so those the equitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2818)|
| 0:47:06| services will come off the top of that but all the money we have to spend it first right before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2826)|
| 0:47:15| we get reimbursed for it so we don't have to we don't have we don't have to spend it all at first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2835)|
| 0:47:23| we spend it over a period of time and then you can you can reimburse it and right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2843)|
| 0:47:29| what they're saying is that those funds have a shelf life until June of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2849)|
| 0:47:37| And I'll jump in too that's that's how well I don't know if I say all but that's how our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2857)|
| 0:47:44| major federal funds work as well like title one is all on a reimbursable type basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2864)|
| 0:47:51| probably 13 or 14 million a year but it's it's really no different than how we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| operating with title one. We do that on an annual basis don't we as far as reimbursement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2875)|
| 0:48:05| We do we do a reimbursement every quarter yes sir. Every quarter? Yes sir. Okay well I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2885)|
| 0:48:14| here's where I made it how much are we going to have to come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2894)|
| 0:48:20| next year to put in the budget to take care of whatever we spend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2900)|
| 0:48:36| I'll try to answer that this way I think I understand the question so right now we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2916)|
| 0:48:45| so for let me let me use title one as an example because it works the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| So title one on an annual basis equates I would say roughly to the same amount that the that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2930)|
| 0:48:57| ESSA or rather the CARES dollars are it's around 13 million after what Cheryl said after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2937)|
| 0:49:05| private school and charter payout we may that we may be looking at somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| looking at somewhere less than a million dollars or so around that so what we would do is we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2950)|
| 0:49:16| purchase this over over time so you know it would I don't think it would put us in any more of any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2956)|
| 0:49:24| financial buy-in than it than it would based on what the board just approved with IDEA and title| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| one as well because we we we have dollars in the bank to cover that that we can replenish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2970)|
| 0:49:37| fairly quickly with with with the with a reimbursement type basis so I don't know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2977)|
| 0:49:45| we've never found ourselves in such a bind where we had to front load the budget in order to cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| our title one reimbursements or our IDEA reimbursements or any of those so I hope I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| hope that that helps answer saying that what I'm getting at is somewhere down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=2995)|
| 0:50:03| are we not going to make these things wear out we're going to have to roll them into our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3003)|
| 0:50:13| budget our annual budget yes that is correct you you are right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3013)|
| 0:50:21| if you get whatever uh if we spend 20 million dollars it's going to have to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3021)|
| 0:50:30| down the road be rolled in uh to the annual budget each year is it not yes and I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3030)|
| 0:50:41| that I would also answer that answer it this way that regardless of what we do with these dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| that's pretty much the scenario we're going to find ourselves with if we utilize these dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| so um if if the if the board decided to use these dollars to fund some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3052)|
| 0:50:57| if the board decided to use these dollars to fund some other initiative in the I'm going to say to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3057)|
| 0:51:03| fund positions then we would find ourself in the in the same predicament I think so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3063)|
| 0:51:11| you know the only way to avoid that predicament is if if we could identify a something that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3071)|
| 0:51:17| only needed one time so we we would I think we would we would have that issue come up regardless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3077)|
| 0:51:26| back and it's very valid the issue that you raise uh back 10 11 years ago during the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3086)|
| 0:51:35| recession the federal government supplied funds it was the American Recovery Relief Act era I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3095)|
| 0:51:42| is what they called it and what those dollars essentially did was allowed us to save I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3102)|
| 0:51:48| I'm doing this from memory 100 teaching positions two years in a row that was a bit um that was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3108)|
| 0:51:54| little bit dangerous but it was we needed the funds otherwise we would be faced with uh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3114)|
| 0:52:01| in mass layoffs so what that did is it allowed us to buy time until those revenue streams picked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3121)|
| 0:52:07| back up uh and so it really served its purpose uh the hope and the expectation would be that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3127)|
| 0:52:15| over time we would see revenues pick back up obviously we can't guarantee that but I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| just say that uh regardless of this funding I suspect and unless somebody can think of something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3140)|
| 0:52:28| I'm not thinking of I suspect that we would have this predicament regardless uh we would either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| you know the only way to avoid it is is some sort of a one-time initiative and I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3153)|
| 0:52:38| on the surface what that would mean um or just refuse the funds I understand what you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3158)|
| 0:52:46| but you make a great point this would be a minor uh in comparison to the dollars we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3166)|
| 0:52:54| I guess and I don't remember whether uh you were still here when this happened or not but if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3174)|
| 0:53:05| weren't well I apologize but uh we got some money and we hired uh in in in the spring we hired like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3185)|
| 0:53:19| 65 teachers and then somebody to supervise them and it was technically it was a one-time deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3199)|
| 0:53:31| but the then superintendent just rolled it into the budget the next year and it's been with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3211)|
| 0:53:40| ever since so you know I guess we're gonna have this ever since also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3220)|
| 0:53:51| I guess that was that was what I was getting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| right I'm not I'm not against it but I do uh have some reservations about you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3235)|
| 0:54:09| us just grabbing for money that that just because it's out there we'll find something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3249)|
| 0:54:17| to that's why we'll make sure that we're going to use it and use it to the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3257)|
| 0:54:25| and the systems benefit as opposed to this throwing dollars thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3265)|
| 0:54:34| thank you Mr. McMillan you know I think there's no question that next year at this time when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3274)|
| 0:54:40| we're looking at the budget it's going you know we're going to continue to have a challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| because um you know I think everybody on the board understands that we have funding for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3284)|
| 0:54:50| year through the CARES Act but after that it will need to come from our budget and so that is that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3290)|
| 0:54:56| definitely going to be an issue my question that I've asked um Shannon Jackson and and Dr. Reiswick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3296)|
| 0:55:03| and also when I speak with principals you know putting aside um if if if funding weren't an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3303)|
| 0:55:11| is this something that we would want to do anyway is this something that we need to do but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3311)|
| 0:55:18| haven't done because of the other priorities that we've needed to find and um so I don't Dr. Reiswick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3318)|
| 0:55:26| if you would want to speak to that or Ms. Jackson you know when I speak to principals their answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| is you know absolutely if we um I know in my district most of our technology that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3331)|
| 0:55:38| has been bought by parents and the parents in my area you know they would like to see the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| school system take on the ownership of those devices so um would either of you like to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3342)|
| 0:55:49| to that point I'll be happy to I can't get my video up sorry but but I'll be happy to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3349)|
| 0:55:57| that Ms. Horne thank you um the um so you know it's interesting because we were talking through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3357)|
| 0:56:05| that very thing and prior to um the whole COVID-19 I think I've got my video sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3365)|
| 0:56:14| there we go good deal prior to COVID-19 uh hitting it was funny we were talking about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3374)|
| 0:56:20| um we were actually meeting as an executive team and talking through this very thing our shortage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3380)|
| 0:56:26| on technology and where our machines were aging out as far as to meet the test components and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3386)|
| 0:56:32| those kinds of things for online that were coming ahead um we've talked through the last couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| budget cycles about the fact that you know kind of the two big instructional materials that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| teachers use are either technology and devices or textbooks and how you all know that firsthand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3401)|
| 0:56:47| neither one of those has really made a budget uh item it's been fun balancing but over the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3407)|
| 0:56:53| couple years to get to that so um to answer your question I think definitely um both uh technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3413)|
| 0:57:01| and materials like textbooks and things like that are definitely resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| to enhance teachers classrooms and I think we just never have had the funds to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| to keep that up but it was interesting we were having that very conversation prior to this virus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3429)|
| 0:57:17| thank you and Mr. McPherson could this funding be used for something like textbooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3437)|
| 0:57:23| um on the surface I would say that would be problematic um because it it needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3443)|
| 0:57:36| somehow or another it it's not this we have flexibility in how to use the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3456)|
| 0:57:42| um but the the points that I've read so far the guidance I received from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3462)|
| 0:57:49| um I I don't want to say no um I think it it could be problematic but we I would feel better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3469)|
| 0:57:59| reaching out and trying and getting confirmation of that first I would be I would be hesitant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3479)|
| 0:58:05| right now to say yes but we haven't received a to be frank uh the guidance is his we have not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3485)|
| 0:58:12| bombarded with with information and um you know there are parameters with with how it's used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3492)|
| 0:58:21| um technology definitely is um is allowable um we have also received some guidance that okay if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3501)|
| 0:58:31| want to uh attach it for other things within our budget we do have some flexibility to to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3511)|
| 0:58:39| um I wish I had a better answer but I would actually would prefer to to get some guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| on that okay Mr. McMillan thank you Madam Chair uh Ron how would I heard you say technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3524)|
| 0:58:56| so they'll improve most any kind of technology but the textbooks uh and the technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3536)|
| 0:59:05| or what we're looking at the technology would both wear out and eventually have to be replaced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3545)|
| 0:59:13| would they not yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3553)|
| 0:59:21| okay we unto that with good textbooks over over the years we have historically at least from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3561)|
| 0:59:28| time to time used fund balance dollars which would be quite a lot of one-time dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3568)|
| 0:59:34| for textbook purchases because we just couldn't we didn't have the capacity in the existing budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| to fund those um so it would not be unprecedented in using one-time funds for for textbooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3578)|
| 0:59:49| five years we'd go seven with yeah so I think you know again I we haven't we just we haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3589)|
| 1:00:00| received a a ton of guidance from um in how to utilize these funds we have received information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3600)|
| 1:00:08| um but I think in fairness to the state even I think the state is reaching out to the federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3608)|
| 1:00:15| government too because they're they're trying to get some answers as well so you know I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| hesitant to say that we cannot use it for textbooks I think it might be problematic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| but I'm not I'm going to stop short of saying that we we can't until I would get confirmation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| for that well I don't want to use it for that in reference to Susan's question I just wondered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3630)|
| 1:00:38| why since both uh items would eventually have to be replaced why you could use it for one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3638)|
| 1:00:48| but not for the other well oh I'm sorry yeah well I think it's probably my one of the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3648)|
| 1:00:55| is that the CARES Act funding is to provide for problem areas that you had during the COVID-19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3655)|
| 1:01:02| closure so technology that's why technology is high on that list because that's a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3662)|
| 1:01:07| reason that people have cited you know for not being able to continue with school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| so I think that's probably that's one of the reasons okay right I think the the the more we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3672)|
| 1:01:20| can attach this to a COVID-related issue then then I think the better let me ask one other thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3680)|
| 1:01:31| now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3691)|
| 1:01:47| well let me ask one other thing then I'll be quiet and I guess I guess I don't know you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3707)|
| 1:01:55| maybe Gail should answer this if we should have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3715)|
| 1:02:01| Q&A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| Start with the, we'd be able to supply each student with some type of device in a matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3722)|
| 1:02:31| of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| Yes, Mr. McMillan, that's the directive that the superintendent gave us, is to find a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3752)|
| 1:02:41| to make sure that we could issue devices to all of our students on very short terms if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3761)|
| 1:02:49| that eventuality happened, if that's the worst case scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| So we've had a little practice in sort of drive-by deployments, if you will, with devices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3772)|
| 1:02:59| we would reenact that on a much larger scale if that were to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| Well, obviously we hope that that doesn't happen, but, you know, there is a lot of talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3784)|
| 1:03:14| around the country about, you know, maybe schools are not starting up, but I guess we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3794)|
| 1:03:22| make that decision as a board and the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3802)|
| 1:03:28| But anyway, I just, I just want to know how quick we could, we can get in to it if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3808)|
| 1:03:38| should absolutely have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| Thank you, Gail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3820)|
| 1:03:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| Other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| Madam Chair, is this where I give my substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| Okay, be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| I propose a substitute motion that approves the use of Pierce Act funding to fund 60,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3834)|
| 1:04:01| Chromebook devices that will be purchased over a multi-year process to ensure we use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3841)|
| 1:04:08| the life of our current 39,846 devices already in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3848)|
| 1:04:16| Board is to review device purchases as they arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3856)|
| 1:04:24| Okay, do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| Okay, Ms. Christie seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| Okay, and discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| Could we have Mr. McPherson just weigh in if this works for what we're trying to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3874)|
| 1:04:40| And if I could just ask another question, that motion specifically says Chromebooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3880)|
| 1:04:47| I'm wondering if for the reason of special needs, if it should not specifically say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3887)|
| 1:04:52| Chromebooks, but devices for signing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| So we may need that question answered also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3895)|
| 1:04:59| Mr. McPherson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3901)|
| 1:05:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| I think if we could maybe put some wording in there that with respect to CARES funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3904)|
| 1:05:11| that would say to help in the purchase of these devices because the reality of it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3911)|
| 1:05:19| the CARES dollars are not sufficient to fund the entire investment of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3919)|
| 1:05:26| So in other words, we can't utilize strictly CARES funding to go one-to-one, if that makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3926)|
| 1:05:35| sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3935)|
| 1:05:36| We're looking at a multi-year deployment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| So I'm not sure if Ms. Satterfield would be open to that, but I just want to be careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3940)|
| 1:05:46| and not lock it in to say that CARES will actually fund the one-to-one initiative because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3946)|
| 1:05:52| the CARES dollars are insufficient to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| They definitely will help and they would supplement those, what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3956)|
| 1:06:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3961)|
| 1:06:02| And then Mr. Myers, can you speak to just the issue of whether that verbiage would take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3962)|
| 1:06:09| care of special needs devices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| I'll defer to Mr. Dupler on the specific verbiage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| But as we spoke in the work session, we'll still be working with our families of children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3979)|
| 1:06:25| with disabilities individually to determine what type of device they may need or what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3985)|
| 1:06:31| type of assistive technology they may need to access a particular device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| So in terms of what the board would be voting on, I'll defer to Mr. Dupler on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=3996)|
| 1:06:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| I would say that we can use the Chromebook language, but go a little bit further to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4009)|
| 1:06:57| or other device as applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| That way, I think the spirit of the motion is to purchase Chromebooks as opposed to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4021)|
| 1:07:07| all MacBook Airs or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| So, but if you added that little bit of other language, other devices as applicable, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4029)|
| 1:07:16| that would solve the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| And Ms. Bounds, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| No, I was just going to ask Mr. Dupler to speak to the substitute motion if it was in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4043)|
| 1:07:28| correct form and it was okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| Uh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| I mean, you know, with that, with that qualification, um, Ms. Satterfield and I were, uh, we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4052)|
| 1:07:39| we're trying to work on that, you know, uh, uh, offline, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4059)|
| 1:07:44| So, uh, that would certainly work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| And then I think the other, what was the other concern besides the, oh, well, and then, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4066)|
| 1:07:52| know, Mr. McPherson was talking about, uh, saying, uh, to, to help fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4072)|
| 1:07:57| I mean, so, so help can, can be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| So, uh, Ms. Satterfield, if you want to perhaps restate the motion and then, and then, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4080)|
| 1:08:07| have the same second, if that would happen, and then we can, we can fix those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4087)|
| 1:08:12| Okay, we're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4094)|
| 1:08:15| I propose a substitute motion that approves the use of CARES Act funding to help fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4095)|
| 1:08:21| 60,000 Chromebook or other necessary devices that will be purchased over a multi-year process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4101)|
| 1:08:28| to ensure we use the life of our current 39,846 devices already in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4108)|
| 1:08:35| Board is to review device purchases as they arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4115)|
| 1:08:40| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| Okay, thank you, Ms., the motion was made by Ms. Satterfield and seconded by Ms. Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4123)|
| 1:08:49| And do we have discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4129)|
| 1:08:55| Okay, Ms. Coatney, we'll have a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4135)|
| 1:08:59| Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| Does Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| Yeah, can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4143)|
| 1:09:04| Are we voting on whether we're, are we voting on whether to approve this or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4144)|
| 1:09:09| I just want to be sure what we're actually voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| Yes, but would be to support Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4153)|
| 1:09:18| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| And so therefore the other, the original motion goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4163)|
| 1:09:24| I, would you restate that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| I didn't, I didn't hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| Me or what Virginia asked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| Restate the motion, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4174)|
| 1:09:35| I propose a substitute motion that approves the use of CARES Act funding to help fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4175)|
| 1:09:42| 60,000 Chromebooks or other necessary devices that will be purchased over a multi-year process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4182)|
| 1:09:50| to ensure we use the life of our current 39,846 devices already in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4190)|
| 1:09:58| Board is to review device purchases as they arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4198)|
| 1:10:03| But what was the, what was the answer to what we were actually committing to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4203)|
| 1:10:12| There's not a dollar amount in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| I think that, oh, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| Are you talking to me, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| Anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| Hutchinson, would you like to take that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| I'm not trying to be difficult, but I'm having trouble hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4225)|
| 1:10:33| It basically would authorize the district to purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4233)|
| 1:10:38| devices over time of using the CARES Act funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4238)|
| 1:10:44| Is that correct to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| Using the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4246)|
| 1:10:47| Using the CARES Act funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| The total amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| It doesn't say that, the motion does not say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| It says it would use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| Can you, why don't you, can you read it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| The motion says the 60,000 Chromebooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| And so that 60,000 is, if that needs to be replaced with 7 million, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4263)|
| 1:11:08| McPherson, that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4268)|
| 1:11:09| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| That's a, that's a, that's a commitment that the average person can understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4270)|
| 1:11:18| That's where I'm going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4278)|
| 1:11:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4279)|
| 1:11:19| I don't know whether it was that, whether we were committing to, you know, 13 million or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4279)|
| 1:11:26| 12 nine or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4291)|
| 1:11:31| McPherson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4291)|
| 1:11:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4292)|
| 1:11:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4292)|
| 1:11:33| I just want to make sure to, yes, that I think that gets it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| Well, one thing too, I want to make sure we get clarification on Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| Satterfield's last part of, of the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4300)|
| 1:11:47| Because I want to make sure we're in compliance with what the board is asking us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| It's something about come back for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| Is that before every purchase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4313)|
| 1:11:57| The only reason I'm asking, I just don't want to endanger the timing, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4317)|
| 1:12:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4320)|
| 1:12:01| So the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| Comply with whatever, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| Yeah, the motion just says to review devices, not to vote on it, not the board, just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4328)|
| 1:12:08| And I interpret that as, you know, inform us that this is what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4328)|
| 1:12:14| As a report, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4338)|
| 1:12:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4341)|
| 1:12:21| So if you, I'm sorry, Ms. Satterfield, can you read it one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| Cause I want to hear the end of it because in my mind, I heard, I heard that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4345)|
| 1:12:32| have to approve before they purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| And that would be a problem because they need to, they need to be able to move more, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| know, faster than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| So can you read that one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| And Mr. Mike, do you, would you like your part to be the 60,000 or 7 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4363)|
| 1:12:50| Can, can I make a suggestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| Can we add in there over, over the five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4372)|
| 1:12:55| Because we're really, we're really committing ourselves to a five-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4375)|
| 1:13:02| Are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4382)|
| 1:13:07| I believe we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| Is that correct, Mr. McPherson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| Because if we're leasing units, we're not doing that for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| We're committing to five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| Why don't we just vote on the whole thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| I'm sorry about my voice, but I mean, again, go ahead, Ron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4401)|
| 1:13:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| If we, if the board commits to do one-to-one, what we are committing to is to do one-to-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4413)|
| 1:13:40| And in order to do that, it would require a $21 million investment spread out over three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4420)|
| 1:13:47| years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4427)|
| 1:13:47| That would be 15, approximately $15 million lease costs with, with, with annual support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4427)|
| 1:13:55| costs built on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| So, I think, I think we have to understand that, that when we, when we commit to one-to-one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4437)|
| 1:14:07| we have a requirement to provide devices to every student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| And that, that is an investment over multiple years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4450)|
| 1:14:16| What could you change to where it said, with the intent to work toward one-to-one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4456)|
| 1:14:23| We are now approving $7, $8 million right now to approve, what was the figure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4463)|
| 1:14:34| $60,000 devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| Was it $40,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4476)|
| 1:14:38| How many Chromebooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| $60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| $60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| $60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| Would that, and we will fund the remainder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4486)|
| 1:14:54| in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| Would that, would that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| And I think that's kind of, the only thing that's missing from what you're stating is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| the actual dollar amount, that $7 million amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4501)|
| 1:15:05| That's the only thing that kind of is not in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| Well, that's the average person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| Yeah, and I'm okay with putting the $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| What you're doing, and then, you know, just throwing a big number of devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4512)|
| 1:15:24| It doesn't matter really, but I just think it would be better to do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4524)|
| 1:15:30| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4530)|
| 1:15:30| And if you want to, if I'm not mistaken, Mr. Dupler, Ms. Satterfield could add the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| And if Ms. Christie is okay with it, then that would become the verbiage for our substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4534)|
| 1:15:40| That, yes, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| Yeah, Ms. Satterfield can propose some altered language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| And then, yeah, Ms. Christie can second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4545)|
| 1:15:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4549)|
| 1:15:49| Madam Chair, before we read it again, are you good with the multi-year process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| Are you put in the five-year process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| So that it reads multi-year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| It already reads multi-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| Okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| No, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| Third time's the charm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| Let's go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| I propose a substitute motion that approves the use of $7 million CARES Act funding to help fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4568)|
| 1:16:15| 60,000 Chromebooks or other necessary devices that will be purchased over a multi-year process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4575)|
| 1:16:22| to ensure we use the life of our current 39,846 devices already in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4582)|
| 1:16:31| Purchase reports will be provided to the board as they occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4591)|
| 1:16:37| And I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4598)|
| 1:16:38| So we have a substitute motion by Ms. Satterfield and a second by Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4598)|
| 1:16:43| Do we have discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| Do we have a dollar figure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4608)|
| 1:16:49| $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4609)|
| 1:16:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4610)|
| 1:16:51| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4615)|
| 1:16:56| Mr. Norman, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| No, just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4621)|
| 1:17:01| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| I love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4623)|
| 1:17:04| But this still, I think we're being irresponsible given there's so much unknown that's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4624)|
| 1:17:14| And so I cannot, I can't vote for this substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4634)|
| 1:17:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| Thank you, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4642)|
| 1:17:23| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4643)|
| 1:17:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| Ms. Coatney will do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4654)|
| 1:17:35| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4655)|
| 1:17:42| We can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4662)|
| 1:17:43| You're on mute, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| Mr. Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4666)|
| 1:17:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4668)|
| 1:17:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4669)|
| 1:17:50| Ms. Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4671)|
| 1:17:52| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4676)|
| 1:17:57| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4677)|
| 1:17:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4678)|
| 1:17:59| Ms. Horne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4679)|
| 1:18:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4680)|
| 1:18:04| Okay, and motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| And we have added an agenda item to the end of our time today regarding the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4689)|
| 1:18:17| our next steps for budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| Ms. Hill, would you like to start us off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| This actually is spurred by a comment that you made, Mr. McMillan, during our last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4705)|
| 1:18:32| asking if it would be possible for all of us to be together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4712)|
| 1:18:38| when together in one place as opposed to Zoom when we try to discuss this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4718)|
| 1:18:47| given the fact that it is so detailed and so much involved in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4727)|
| 1:18:54| I feel very strongly that this should occur, and we clearly see around us that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4734)|
| 1:19:05| there are meetings that are occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4745)|
| 1:19:09| I think we're all adults enough to make whatever decision we feel like is best for us personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4749)|
| 1:19:18| as to whether attend in person or attend via Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4758)|
| 1:19:24| I'd like to talk about if there's a legality with us using both meetings at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4764)|
| 1:19:32| should some of us want to be together and others may not feel comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4772)|
| 1:19:38| Mr. Duper, is there anything that would preclude that kind of a setup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| given these extraordinary times we're in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| Well, I mean, the way I read Governor Lee's executive order number 16,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4787)|
| 1:19:55| the board would take that along with the fact that the main assembly room is being used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4795)|
| 1:20:04| according to the guidelines for General Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| So, you know, the meeting room that we would be using is being used under these circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4808)|
| 1:20:15| So taking those two things together, the school system could put together what I would call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4815)|
| 1:20:22| a hybrid meeting, which would be one that you could have the board as participants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4822)|
| 1:20:30| and certainly Knox County School staff, but the catch would be the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4830)|
| 1:20:38| And I would recommend, or my office would recommend that at the very least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4838)|
| 1:20:44| it would have to be live streamed so that the public could see it as it occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4844)|
| 1:20:51| And probably some type of mechanism be made for the public to make a comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4851)|
| 1:21:00| perhaps more than what's going on with the Zoom meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| I appreciate that and I concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4863)|
| 1:21:09| Talking to, I guess, Mr. Oaks or Ms. Baird, as far as technology piece goes, is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4869)|
| 1:21:17| something that you feel like could be reasonably accommodated for we to choose to meet this way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4877)|
| 1:21:26| I think I would, this is Russ, I think I would defer to Gail on that or, yeah, I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4886)|
| 1:21:43| thoroughly versed enough in the details how to make that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4903)|
| 1:21:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4913)|
| 1:21:54| Okay, Gail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4914)|
| 1:21:55| Hi, I'm not sure I'm understanding the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| So, we're talking about a hybrid type of meeting and the question is around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4918)|
| 1:22:04| voting or taking action or is it just around participation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| Are we talking about the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| It would be both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4928)|
| 1:22:09| We would be discussing and then voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| So, it would basically be if any board members did not feel okay to meet in person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4932)|
| 1:22:19| could they participate via Zoom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| And then, in addition to that, I'm assuming we could do this same kind of format so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| the public could also be watching at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4946)|
| 1:22:32| My only concern there is the network at City County Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4952)|
| 1:22:38| We'd have to do some technical checking to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| It would be at the AJ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4963)|
| 1:22:44| At the AJ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| Oh, it would be at the AJ, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| I think that we could pull that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| Is there any concern around legality?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| I guess would be my question in terms of the statute that allowed for remote meetings for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4974)|
| 1:23:03| board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4983)|
| 1:23:03| Gary, do you have any concerns with regards to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| Is that where we started this conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4990)|
| 1:23:11| And, I mean, what you're talking about is Executive Order 16, you know, that allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4991)|
| 1:23:17| for these electronic meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| But, you know, the way I read that order, it does not preclude a hybrid, allowing some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=4999)|
| 1:23:27| people attending by, you know, using the Health Department guidelines, the social| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5007)|
| 1:23:32| distancing and things, plus some others attending electronically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5012)|
| 1:23:38| So, I mean, it's a little vague, you know, as you might expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5018)|
| 1:23:43| But what it does require is that, at the very least, live streaming to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5023)|
| 1:23:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5028)|
| 1:23:49| So, we will certainly test that, as we've done with all of our previous meeting setups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5029)|
| 1:23:54| and we'll work with Public Affairs to make sure that that's operational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5034)|
| 1:23:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5039)|
| 1:24:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| Is there a need for discussion or a vote on this suggestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5042)|
| 1:24:10| I don't think we need to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| We had kind of already been talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| So, I think that we just need to work out the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5054)|
| 1:24:18| And so, since we've moved it to the 27th, we're looking at having it in the AJ, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5058)|
| 1:24:26| we, I think the big thing will just be how to involve board members who aren't able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| And how do we involve the public, and just giving them an opportunity to, like Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5072)|
| 1:24:38| Dupler said, be able to comment and ask questions more in a live manner, rather than an email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5078)|
| 1:24:44| manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| So, we'll need to work through the details on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5089)|
| 1:24:49| And I certainly have no objection where we meet, whether it's the AJ or the City County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5089)|
| 1:24:56| Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5096)|
| 1:24:57| My just general comment might be that if spacing and distance is a concern, that that might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5097)|
| 1:25:05| be better accommodated at the City County Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| But again, I will defer to those that know much more than I do about the logistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5108)|
| 1:25:17| Okay, we'll take that into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| Thank you, Ms. Hill, for offering that suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5120)|
| 1:25:26| And I think you'll find that when you can look at somebody, even if it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5126)|
| 1:25:35| a few feet away, that it works better than, you know, there's some things, other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5135)|
| 1:25:43| you pick up as far as communication and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5143)|
| 1:25:49| I think the AJ would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5149)|
| 1:25:55| We just have to scatter out, but I believe that it would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5155)|
| 1:26:01| Now, there's a, it wasn't in the Governor's order, but just for your information, Gary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5161)|
| 1:26:11| you might want to check with your boss on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| There is something that says that you cannot, well, we're talking about skyping back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5174)|
| 1:26:23| those days, but I think this same principle would apply, that you couldn't participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5183)|
| 1:26:31| as far as unless you were out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5191)|
| 1:26:37| No, you're right, Mr. McMillan, you know, and that's been part of board policy for quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5197)|
| 1:26:48| some time, but the Governor's order did, you know, allow for those rules, for that law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5208)|
| 1:26:56| and those rules to be relaxed during, you know, dealing with the COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5216)|
| 1:27:01| But you're right, those rules and laws do exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5221)|
| 1:27:05| And, you know, I think the advantage to the AJ, even over the main assembly room, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5225)|
| 1:27:10| is that at the AJ, board members can sit every other chair and the staff can use the gallery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5230)|
| 1:27:18| seating and just come up to the podium for comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| So we can probably, or we could even put a table at the, you know, to kind of finish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5241)|
| 1:27:27| the horseshoe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5247)|
| 1:27:27| And so there's a, there are ways to spread out, I think, in that room that would accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5247)|
| 1:27:33| some distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| So we'll, yeah, so we'll work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| We've already, we've already been talking about it, so we'll continue to work in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5261)|
| 1:27:42| And I think that'll work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5267)|
| 1:27:48| Great suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| Any other, any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| Okay, we'll try to work out those details in the next few days and get that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5272)|
| 1:27:57| to board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5277)|
| 1:27:58| And, Mr. Thomas, you mentioned a virtual public town hall meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5278)|
| 1:28:07| That's still a possibility, I'm assuming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5287)|
| 1:28:10| Right, it's still a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| We're, we're having conversations about that, and we'll get some information out pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5291)|
| 1:28:16| soon on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| Okay, all right, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| Good, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5302)|
| 1:28:23| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| Okay, if there's nothing, yes, Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5305)|
| 1:28:30| Just one quick comment, Mr. Superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5310)|
| 1:28:34| Based on your remarks, I feel like y'all have gone a long way toward solving the graduation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5314)|
| 1:28:43| problem, and it's going to work for most people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5323)|
| 1:28:48| And I, as a board member, want to tell you how much I appreciate y'all doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5328)|
| 1:28:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5337)|
| 1:28:57| Appreciate, appreciate the board as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200513?start=5337)|
