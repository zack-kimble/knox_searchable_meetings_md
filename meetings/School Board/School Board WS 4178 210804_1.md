| 2:58:33| t-cap scores and we saw a decline in scores and that was expected particularly with kids who were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10713)|
| 2:58:40| doing virtual learning but it was interesting to me that those scores were also declined for kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10720)|
| 2:58:45| who were doing in-school learning and I had to wonder if they were in school why did their scores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10725)|
| 2:58:50| decline was there a fear factor was it the masks I don't know that we could really tease that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10730)|
| 2:58:56| but it's food for thought and I just wanted you guys to consider that lastly and you know because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10736)|
| 2:59:03| it was brought up I feel like there's this pressure to get vaccinated to get vaccinated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10743)|
| 2:59:10| why was the vaccine created it was created to develop antibodies to COVID within your body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10750)|
| 2:59:15| right we wanted to hurry and get those antibodies in people well if you've had COVID you have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10755)|
| 2:59:21| antibodies and the data is showing that the natural antibodies for people who have had COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10761)|
| 2:59:27| is actually stronger than those created by the vaccine hence the many breakthroughs from people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10767)|
| 2:59:33| who have had the vaccine and are still getting COVID the data out there it's not exactly clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10773)|
| 2:59:39| but most people have had COVID the majority of people have had COVID we know that many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10779)|
| 2:59:46| who get it up to 40 maybe never even have symptoms that was the case in my household| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10786)|
| 2:59:52| but when we tell somebody to go get vaccinated without knowing their health history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10792)|
| 2:59:58| especially because this is an experimental vaccine that can be damaging and the research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10798)|
| 3:00:03| I'm reading is that if you've had COVID and get the vaccine it can be even more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10803)|
| 3:00:07| likely that you'll have life-threatening side effects from the vaccine there's just too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10807)|
| 3:00:12| we don't know and I think unless you're somebody's medical provider and know their medical history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10812)|
| 3:00:17| it's really out of scope to suggest that they get a vaccine and so I would just caution people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10817)|
| 3:00:24| in the position of leadership to encourage the vaccine if that's out of your scope to do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10824)|
| 3:00:30| and I yield the rest of my time I thank you guys for your service. Thank you Deborah Howard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10830)|
| 3:00:47| Deborah Howard, Knox County. Is that good? Could you hear me? Okay I'm kind of short so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10847)|

| 3:01:06| of the choice to not wear a mask or to wear a mask so I'm a PA in in the county um and you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10866)|
| 3:01:16| I'm not a not a CDC person I'm not a Tennessee Department of Health person I'm none of that but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10876)|
| 3:01:23| um this is a virus it's peaking at the same time as it did last year um it's going to probably fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10883)|
| 3:01:32| precipitously the same way it did last year it doesn't really have anything to do with the mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10892)|
| 3:01:37| or without a mask just doesn't have anything to do with it um every adult who wishes to have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10897)|
| 3:01:43| the vaccine has had the opportunity plenty of opportunity to get the vaccine so there shouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10903)|
| 3:01:49| be any question there um not a single person needs to worry about anyone else's decision to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10909)|
| 3:01:59| wear a mask not wear a mask get a vaccine not get a vaccine it's nobody else's business but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10919)|
| 3:02:04| that individual person so I just again want to say thank you to those of you who you know know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10924)|
| 3:02:11| that it should be a choice um none of the optional mask proponents care if anyone else wears a mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10931)|
| 3:02:21| I don't think you'll have any problem with any anyone who sees somebody wearing a mask like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10941)|
| 3:02:27| making fun of them or doing anything like that um we don't care if you do or don't take a vaccine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10947)|
| 3:02:33| um all we wanted for throughout the last year has just been to be provided the choice and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10953)|
| 3:02:39| think that's what you've done um and I think that's fantastic so I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=10959)|

| 3:03:33| school board is to provide an accessible learning environment and children under 12 do not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11013)|
| 3:03:38| access to a COVID-19 vaccine right now. Reports say that they're expected after school starts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11018)|
| 3:03:45| some saying in September some saying October maybe midwinter nobody really knows but we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11025)|
| 3:03:51| know that it's coming um as our children's parents caretakers and school community our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11031)|
| 3:03:56| kids trust us to lead them into safe and accessible learning they trust us with their well-being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11036)|
| 3:04:02| and currently with the understanding uh right now as it stands that there's no mask mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11042)|
| 3:04:10| no temperature check and no contact tracing that we're allowing a known harm COVID-19 and its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11050)|

| 3:04:24| next leaders and decision makers of our county and of our nation. COVID-19 is devastating among| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11064)|
| 3:04:31| children and adults the effects short and long term are real whether you've had symptoms or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11071)|
| 3:04:37| they are real. Hospitalizations of children due to COVID-19 are increasing with some cases being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11077)|
| 3:04:44| fatal. In the U.S. cases among teens and children have gone up 84 percent this week alone cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11084)|
| 3:04:52| locally and nationally are rising and will continue to rise if precautions are not put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11092)|
| 3:04:58| The Delta variant has been found to be as contagious as the chickenpox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11098)|
| 3:05:03| Parents entrust the school board and the schools with the safety of their children while in school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11103)|
| 3:05:09| that trust is broken when COVID-19 cases are no longer being communicated and the COVID dashboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11109)|
| 3:05:16| no longer shows data from October 2020 to now. I tried to get the numbers today and I only got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11116)|
| 3:05:21| August and September of last year. Our county vaccination rate is not high enough for herd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11121)|
| 3:05:28| immunity and COVID is still a danger to our community and to children unable or yet ineligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11128)|
| 3:05:34| for a vaccine as well as those with pre-existing conditions and autoimmune diseases. To keep our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11134)|
| 3:05:40| children safe and provide them the best learning opportunities we must adapt and overcome to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11140)|

| 3:05:50| to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We have taken a number of actions from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11150)|
| 3:05:56| Wear a mask, provide temp checks, provide contact tracing. These are 3 simple steps to keep our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11156)|
| 3:06:01| vulnerable children safe from a devastating virus while continuing to provide excellent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11161)|
| 3:06:06| accessible learning. However, if these precautions are available are not decided upon, then please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11166)|
| 3:06:14| do not hesitate to contact the American Academy of Pediatrics and re-implement school actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11174)|
| 3:06:17| If you have not done so, then thank you. But can students who go virtual or homeschool for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11177)|
| 3:06:23| fall return for in-person in the spring. Can you offer separate rooms or teaching environments for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11183)|
| 3:06:29| those who want to wear a mask? The virus is adapting among the unvaccinated and we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11189)|
| 3:06:35| to adapt and overcome that. And again, UT this week issued mask wear mandates for those in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11195)|
| 3:06:42| and I know that we are trying to keep ahead of all the information that is coming out and there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11202)|
| 3:06:48| is a lot of information coming out. But again, this virus has been adapting and it is proliferating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11208)|
| 3:06:54| among the unvaccinated. Viruses want to live and they will change how they work to extend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11214)|
| 3:07:03| And we need to change how we're precautioning ourselves and taking care of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11223)|
| 3:07:08| and our most vulnerable. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11228)|

| 3:07:25| Can you hear me okay? I was going to shorten what I said, what I was planning to say because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11245)|
| 3:07:31| it's already been covered. But because my youngest daughter can't get vaccinated and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11251)|
| 3:07:36| our family has continued, our family has continued to wear masks in public even when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11256)|
| 3:07:41| restrictions are lifted. We've successfully kept the virus out of our home and have no intention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11261)|
| 3:07:46| of letting it enter and that is why we're requiring both our in-school students to wear a mask while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11266)|
| 3:07:53| in school. But based on what we've experienced from those in the public as well as friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11273)|
| 3:07:58| and even members of our own family, we're concerned about them being harassed, bullied or made to feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11278)|
| 3:08:03| uncomfortable because they're doing something their parents are requiring them to do. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11283)|
| 3:08:09| they have a choice to take the mask off when they leave our site, but we're hoping they will make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11289)|
| 3:08:13| the right choice. But doing the right thing is a lot harder to make when you've got someone making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11293)|
| 3:08:19| fun of you for that choice or pressuring you to choose other options. I'm being perfectly honest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11299)|
| 3:08:26| when I say my kids know without confusion how I feel about not being vaccinated and not wearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11306)|
| 3:08:32| masks indoors in public. They hear it daily. However, they also know that giving their friends a hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11312)|
| 3:08:39| time about choosing not to be vaccinated and not wearing masks in public or any other choice they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11319)|
| 3:08:45| make about themselves whether it be hairstyle, clothes, religion or politics is not okay and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11325)|
| 3:08:51| won't be tolerated in our family. However, I seriously doubt that every parent feels this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11331)|
| 3:08:57| or has the same policy that we do even though we realize there's a possibility that unmasked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11337)|
| 3:09:02| students might face ridicule as well based on the fact that less than 40 percent of those eligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11342)|
| 3:09:08| for vaccination are vaccinated in Tennessee and along with the number of people I see in stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11348)|
| 3:09:14| not wearing masks, my children and others like them are much more likely to be subject to scorn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11354)|
| 3:09:19| and ridicule. Parents would like very much to know what policies will be in place to make sure our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11359)|
| 3:09:26| children aren't subjected to harassment for wearing masks. Also, will it be acceptable for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11366)|
| 3:09:32| teachers who can't understand our masked students to ask them to remove or pull their masks down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11372)|
| 3:09:38| while speaking? This happened many times last year. My wife and I along with what I assume are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11378)|
| 3:09:45| hundreds of other parents are well aware that kids will be subjected to conflicting information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=11385)|
