| 0:02:03| Any discussion? Councilman Campin, is your light on? Oh, sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=123)|
| 0:02:09| All right, so we have a motion and a second to approve the minutes. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| Any opposed? Minutes have been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=133)|
| 0:02:18| Is there anything to be withdrawn? Any items for postponement? Items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=138)|

| 0:02:39| Any opposed? The consent items have been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| Thank you for the Mayor's report. First, I want to recognize someone who's here with us tonight, Jeffrey Ebertine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=163)|
| 0:02:52| Ebertine. Ebertine. Am I pronouncing it right? Ebertine. Ebertine. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=172)|
| 0:02:59| If I said Allison first, I'd probably say it right, okay? Jeffrey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| He's with Troop 46. Stand up, Jeffrey. Troop 46 from Koxbury United Methodist Church, and he's here for his communications badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=183)|
| 0:03:12| And he's accompanied by his mother, who we all know is Allison, from the law department, who's been with the city for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=192)|
| 0:03:19| So thank you, Jeffrey, for being here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=199)|
| 0:03:29| You might want to move over and sit next to Eric Vreeland or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=209)|
| 0:03:34| Since it's communications, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| Okay, I do first want to express our condolences and prayers from all of us to the family and loved ones of former City Councilwoman Jean Teague,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=217)|
| 0:03:46| who passed away a few weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| Ms. Teague represented the 2nd District on City Council for nearly three decades, and she stayed civically engaged long after she left office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=229)|
| 0:03:59| For many years, she still came to nearly every council meeting, and her dedication and her love for West Hills neighborhood showed in everything that she did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=239)|
| 0:04:07| She was still coming to neighborhood association meetings literally right to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=247)|
| 0:04:12| Just a week or two before she passed, she was at a short-term rentals meeting where she was very passionate about her position on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=252)|
| 0:04:22| It is fitting that if you search her name online, the first thing you find is the Jean Teague Greenway, which runs right through West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=262)|
| 0:04:31| So it is really a great tribute to her, and she is truly a great example of the impact that one person can make through public service and by getting involved in your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=271)|
| 0:04:41| So we're forever in her debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| I know many of us were at her funeral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| And that's actually a perfect segue, her being a councilwoman and actively involved, to talking again about City Council elections that are coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=286)|
| 0:04:57| The voting is about to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| Early voting in the five council district primaries begins next Wednesday, August 9th, so that's a week from tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=299)|
| 0:05:07| Those 30 candidates will all be on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| You only get to vote for those in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| And that early voting goes from August 9th through Thursday, August 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=315)|
| 0:05:22| And then the actual day of the election, if you don't early vote, is Tuesday, August 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| And you can find information about the elections and who are the candidates running in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| You can find links to their Facebook and Twitter and website at GoVoteKnoxville.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=332)|
| 0:05:40| GoVoteKnoxville.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| Also, you can find out about early voting locations and the times that the early voting locations are open at the website of the Knox County Election Commission, which is KnoxVotes.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=343)|
| 0:05:56| As I have said several times, these elections are very important to the future of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=356)|
| 0:06:03| Five of these individuals are leaving us at the end of the year, and five new people will be sitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=363)|
| 0:06:09| That's the majority of our council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| So we want to see good folks up here, and we want to see many people in the community out there voting to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=371)|
| 0:06:18| And just to give you a benchmark, the last time these five seats were all open with no incumbents was 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=378)|
| 0:06:26| The total turnout that year in the primary elections was just over 4,000 votes, 4,049 to be precise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=386)|
| 0:06:35| So there are about 88,000 registered voters in Knoxville, and yet only 4,000 showed up to pick a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=395)|
| 0:06:43| Now, they picked wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| I have to say they picked very wisely, those 4,000 who did show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=406)|
| 0:06:51| But with 30 candidates, a lot of folks out there knocking on doors and all, we hope to see a lot more people turn out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=411)|
| 0:06:59| and I hope they make the same wise decision as they did eight years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=419)|
| 0:07:05| Yeah, Mayor, I just want to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| I'd like to personally thank not only you but your staff for the five meetings that you had in the different districts to help to get people out to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=427)|
| 0:07:15| I thought that the turnout was good, and hopefully all those people went out and talked to five or six more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=435)|
| 0:07:22| But I really want to thank you and Jesse and the staff for putting that together and doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| And is there going to be one more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| There will be one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| It's on September 7, and that will be at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=451)|
| 0:07:37| Christenberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| Christenberry, because we're going to now be in the fifth district, and so we will invite all ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=458)|
| 0:07:46| By that time, we'll be narrowed down to two people from each district, so we'll have ten people still standing, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=466)|
| 0:07:53| And so they'll all be invited, and the whole community is invited to come on out to the fifth district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=473)|
| 0:07:59| to Christenberry Community Center, Recreation Center, to meet those ten final candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=479)|
| 0:08:06| because everybody who lives in the city will be able to vote in each of those districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=486)|
| 0:08:11| so you need to know who your choices are in each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| So thank you for pointing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| If all 88,000 come, you might need to be in Neyland Stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| That would be a wonderful problem to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| There's a big ball field there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| We'll spread on out if that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| And I do also want to thank really Jesse and Eric, and their team really came up with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=509)|
| 0:08:35| I think Eric really drove a lot of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| And then, of course, special events were involved in making it happen, got all the bunting and all that nice stuff out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=518)|
| 0:08:47| Some local businesses provided snacks in addition to the pizza that we brought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| And, of course, the Parks and Recreation, the Recreation Center leaders and all were all a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| So it was a labor of love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| People really were excited about it and had a good time doing it, so thank you for recognizing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| Okay, so today is the first day of August, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| and that month should sound familiar to you, August 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| because for the past two years we have been promising that Cumberland Avenue Streetscapes Project would be complete in August 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=554)|
| 0:09:22| And I'm happy to tell you that thanks to Don Michelle and Wallace and all of that team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| it actually is going to happen on time and within budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| So there's still a few, a little bit of landscaping and some tree plantings we can't really do until later in the year anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=571)|
| 0:09:38| but right now we are wrapping up the final phase of the street and the sidewalk work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| So I want to invite everyone to join me and our special guest, Governor Bill Haslam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| for an official ribbon cutting for the completed project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| That will be on Thursday, August 17th at 4 p.m. at the Howard Baker Jr. Center at the corner of Cumberland and 17th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=592)|
| 0:10:02| We're sending out invitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| Everyone will be getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| If you don't receive an invitation in the mail, you're still invited, or in the email, you're still invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=606)|
| 0:10:12| So we're very happy that Governor Haslam will join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| As you all remember, the original planning and vision for this project really got started during his time as mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=615)|
| 0:10:22| and Bill Lyons was there with him getting that whole project started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| And then, of course, TDOT has been a very important partner and funding source as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=627)|
| 0:10:33| So I encourage everyone to take a drive or stroll or ride the CAT bus down Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=633)|
| 0:10:39| and take a look at it and join us on August 17th at 4 p.m. at the Baker Center on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=639)|
| 0:10:46| That same day, we'll also have another exciting event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| The latest class of Knoxville Police Department recruits will graduate from the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| This is a really impressive group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| I had the chance to go visit with them Monday, I guess it was, yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=656)|
| 0:11:02| I visited with them in the afternoon and got to talk with all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| And they have had 25 weeks of arduous training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| They have three more to go, and then they'll be ready to graduate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| So they're looking forward to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| It's Thursday, August 17th at 6 p.m. at Sevier Heights Baptist Church on Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=675)|
| 0:11:21| I encourage everyone to come on out and show support for these new officers who have stepped forward to serve our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=681)|
| 0:11:28| We need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| As you know, with the older officers retiring, we have a lot of openings to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| We've already, Chief Rausch and his staff have already started interviewing candidates for the next recruit class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=694)|
| 0:11:41| which we hope to start, I think, early January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| And it sounds like we've got some good applicants as well for that class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=706)|
| 0:11:51| So, again, the current class is graduating 6 p.m., August 17th at Sevier Heights Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| Hope to see you all there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| That's the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| Council reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| We'll move on then to elections and confirmations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=723)|

| 0:15:26| but there was an objection by one of the neighbors about the traffic and the concern for more traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=926)|
| 0:15:34| I think the answer officially given was we'll deal with that later in the use on review, but how did you resolve that concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=934)|
| 0:15:44| Gerald Green, Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| That property is located near the intersection of Dean Hill Drive and Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| The traffic that we anticipate on it will not be significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| It's not going through the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| No, it should not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| Most traffic generated will just come from Kingston Pike or go to Kingston Pike from this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| and not through the residential area based on the traffic analysis that was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| Also, it's located near a transit line, so the residents of the proposed multifamily development will have access to transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=969)|
| 0:16:17| So you think the location is good and the objection doesn't really tip it anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=983)|

| 0:16:26| Oh, I'm sorry, Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| I was just going to say this is in my district, and I talked to several of the neighbors who are not really concerned about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=988)|
| 0:16:34| and that the one person that was concerned about the traffic was really sort of satisfied with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=994)|
| 0:16:39| And as Gerald pointed out, it's down towards the intersection of Kingston Pike, and so that area is being developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=999)|
| 0:16:46| so there's really not a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1006)|

| 0:20:35| I would like to add a personal note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| I've known Bill, I've known him for a long time, probably at least since 1990| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| when I first ran for county commission up in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| I know he was involved in politics, loved politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| He was involved in the community, of course a big supporter of Fulton High,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| which is the high school where my kids graduated from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| As a firefighter, he was in the president of the union,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| always a big supporter of our firefighting, of our firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| Even now as mayor, he often called on me on issues, whether it was related to Fulton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1270)|
| 0:21:16| or to the fire department, and just like Gene T., he went to meetings right up to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1276)|
| 0:21:22| He would still come to our pension board meetings, and I really appreciated that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1282)|
| 0:21:27| because he wanted to make sure that not only were the retirees taken care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| but that the active force, that we were taking good care of them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| So he never stopped until he was called to a better place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| So I really appreciate both on a personal level his friendship and his support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| He always gave me so much support, but also from a community perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1306)|
| 0:21:52| with the great service that he provided to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| Obviously, we've got another firefighter in the family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| and I appreciate the continued service of the Warwicks for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1325)|

| 0:22:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| And Councilman Pavlis wants to say a few words too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| I just can't miss the opportunity to talk just a little bit about Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| He was such a great friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| I'll never forget when I was first elected and had been elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| and I went back over to—was he stationed at 11 during his last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| And he and Eddie Curriton were there, and they sat me down and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| we didn't support you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| We didn't vote for you at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| And I thought, okay, because, you know, when you're elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| you can't find anybody that didn't vote for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| But they were very honest about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| and I so remember that little old kitchen and them sitting me down and telling me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| But we worked through all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| But his work there, I'm not sure that he started it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| but I want to give him credit for the Christmas celebration that they had there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| at the station for so many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| I assume it still carries on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| And it's just—it was wonderful not only for that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| and fire stations do that for—make a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| They really went over and above to make that such a celebration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1412)|
| 0:23:38| and I know Bill was a driving force in behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| And I know during the resolution, Mayor Brown mentioned many of his other attributes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| which was his community service outside of a firefighter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| and he was a firefighter's firefighter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| He was absolutely one of the top leaders in recent years that this fire department has seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1431)|
| 0:24:00| And his community involvement carried on to the museum, to the Alumni Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1440)|
| 0:24:08| as was mentioned, North Knox Business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| and he just continued his service after his retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| and had one of the best yard sign placements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| You got it on both ends, two ends of the road, so he turned into a great friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| Are you term-limited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| Yeah, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| That's why I can talk about it, because I am term-limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| But he was a fine gentleman, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| and just miss him but appreciate what he left, his legacy that he left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1471)|
| 0:24:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| Well, I have to dovetail that and say that any time we were at the North Knoxville Business Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| he was always called on to prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| And the richness and the thoughtfulness of his prayer was very meaningful, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| and that's what I always remember about Bill Warwick, and I always appreciate that very, very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| Yes, even though I read the resolution, I'd like to say that whenever I would see him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| he was always very complimentary to me, and he always gave me an encouraging word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1501)|
| 0:25:07| and sometimes you don't always get those compliments and encouragement in this line of work, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| So I always thought very highly of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| I just wanted to let you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| And Chief Stark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| Yeah, I not only knew Bill for my 21 years in the fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1522)|
| 0:25:28| and appreciate all he did for all of the firefighters when he was the association president,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| but he also was a very close friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| I first met him in 1978 when we started attending church together many, many years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| and he and his family have been very, very close to me and to my family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| and he has been kind of a grandfather figure to my daughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1552)|
| 0:25:58| and to many young ladies in our church, too, and he will be deeply missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1558)|
| 0:26:06| Thank you, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| I think we need to move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| Well, I'm still going to vote on it, but I wanted to make sure everybody had a chance to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1577)|

| 0:26:37| Thank you to the group and to the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| 11B is a resolution reconsidering the postponement to October 24, 2017 of an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| to amend Chapter 16 of Knox City Code to add a new article entitled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| short-term rentals to established regulations for short-term rental units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| in order to allow sufficient time to allow the proposed ordinance to be considered at MPC by City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| before the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| I just wanted to explain what happened, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| You know, we made a commitment that we'd get this done before the five of us left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| Yeah, you promised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| I promised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| You know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| Well, once we got back in the next couple of days, we realized there's a pretty tight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| time frame, and so we have scheduled two workshops, but we are going to need to, this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1637)|
| 0:27:25| is going to need to vote on this either August 15th or the 29th because we're required 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| days before it goes back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| It would then go back to MPC in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| Hopefully they'll make no changes to it, and then send it back to us, Gerald, no changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1655)|
| 0:27:42| and then we would vote on it in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| Otherwise, if we kept it the way it was, it would turn over till the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| So anyway, summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| We may not get to vote on this, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| There may not be enough votes for reconsideration, is that right, Councilman Bowers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| Okay, so really what we, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| So what we need to vote on is we do need to vote to reconsider, and then vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| My recommendation would be that hopefully we could go ahead and vote on this on August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| Okay, so first I need the motion to reconsider the prior ordinance that you recently, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1691)|
| 0:28:18| this is referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| That's sufficient for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| Okay, so we have a motion, now we need six votes in order to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1702)|
| 0:28:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1708)|

| 0:28:31| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| That's unanimous of those that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| And now we need a motion to postpone to the new date, which is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| Well, I'd like to hear from Council, my colleagues, does, do you have a preference, the 15th or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1719)|

| 0:31:34| Becky, if you turn to paragraph 1.6, it's on page 165, it has Art Cade as the contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1894)|
| 0:31:42| for KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| He happened to retire and is playing golf and tennis and he doesn't really care to sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| You might want to send it to the new guy, whoever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| We will correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| He's waving his hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| He's in the back of the room, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| My point is, I sure hope that you sit down with KCDC and talk about what I think was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1920)|
| 0:32:06| still an open question, that is that they didn't seem to leave, I don't know, an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| or a half acre or something for a ball field or a playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| I know there's a boys and girls club there, but you're going to have all those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| They need a place to go take their bat and their ball and go fool around in the afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| I hope there's something nearby that will be walkable to kids who might live in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1944)|
| 0:32:31| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| I'm sure the senior citizens won't be playing that much ball, but the young kids will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| There wasn't anything in the plan they presented several months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| I don't know if there still is or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| Becky Wade, Director of Community Development for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| Actually on this phase three, there is some open space now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| They've had to make some changes to the site based on unit count, and there will be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1968)|
| 0:32:56| open space at the corner of Kenner, at the end, down kind of behind where the Cherokee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1976)|
| 0:33:04| Health building is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| It's not programmed, it's not set up as a field, but it will be open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| But it's available so that they can develop it as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| That's great, because I just had this picture of being hemmed in by a bunch of buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| and kids have no place to go, and that's when bad things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| The other addition to this is that the greenway will go from the park there, Hardy Park, through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2001)|
| 0:33:32| the development all the way over and connect up the hill on the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| So that's some walkable green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2020)|

| 0:35:08| Yeah, we have 142 locations out here right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| It takes, they all have to be manually programmed each school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2112)|
| 0:35:19| Because they are manually programmed, they don't respond to special events very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2119)|
| 0:35:25| If there's a weather event and school has to start late or end early, there's nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2125)|
| 0:35:31| we can do about it as far as the flashers go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| And also, the system is old enough that it's starting to get kind of unreliable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| The new system, when we replace it, will have communications back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| It'll tell us if it's broken, and we can program it remotely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| We can respond to events as they happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| But it also has more programming flexibility, so we can put in more different kinds of events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2156)|
| 0:36:03| So it saves us, it takes one dedicated person two to three weeks to go out and program everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| It might take three hours with the new system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| So like the red light systems, you'll have more control centrally of what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| Yes, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| And all you've got to worry about now is a nine-year-old kid who calls in a fire alarm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| and turns the signals on remotely by his hack in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| No, I'm just teasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| Never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| I hope that's not a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| We'll make sure that's not a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| Vice Mayor Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| I was just curious, Mayor, is, I realize these are city streets, and it's our responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| around, does the school in any way help the city with this in terms of payments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2200)|
| 0:36:49| Or has that even been looked into in terms of their support since we're doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| How many did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| 130 some?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| 142.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| 142.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| Have we ever even asked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| No, but I would, just from my own standpoint, I wouldn't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| I mean, they've got many of their own challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| These are streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| They're our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| So we're willing to put them in there and to support it, so yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| And we police those streets and the activity on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| I mean, we could ask them, I guess, but I'd assume let's do this and let them focus on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| So we have, oh, I'm sorry, Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| I had one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| I noticed that company is out of Decatur, Alabama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| Did you have any local companies to bid on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| Well, we got three bidders, and I'm not entirely sure who the other two were, but this is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| specialized stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| So there's nobody in Knoxville that is capable of doing this, and as it turns out, deeply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2267)|
| 0:37:59| buried in the packet, it points out that our forces, our staff will actually be installing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2279)|
| 0:38:07| the equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| It's just, it's changing out the controller, the flasher unit and the post and all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2288)|
| 0:38:16| stuff stays in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| It's just a matter of pulling out an electronic unit and putting the new one in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| They will come to us all programmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| So they're not coming from Decatur to do the work we're doing the work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| They're just mailing us the equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| Well, I'm sure they'll do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| We have an aye as a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a second amendment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2318)|
| 0:38:46| lease agreement with Shirley Fields for the city's use of a multi-bay automotive shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| building and surrounding property located at 5615 Washington Pike to extend the term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| of the lease for an additional five months through September 30, 2017 at a cost of $4,400| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2335)|
| 0:39:01| per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| Councilman Dallin, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| Yeah, I wonder if Christy or someone can tell us, are we going to be ready for this thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| I know we had construction work and maybe some site issues that we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| No, we're very, very close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| In fact, the mayor and I did a tour last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| It looks really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| We did do an extension of the lease for where we are currently just to give us some flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| but we will be moving fairly soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| What is the latest, David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| August 30th, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| Yeah, August 30th, hopefully, but we just wanted to make sure we provided ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| some cushion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| And once we move in, of course, we'll have the right to terminate this lease and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| not obligated for the full term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| Well, that's exciting news because you'll have your guys together in the Rain Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| We'll have a wonderful ribbon cutting at some point, invite everyone out, and of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| I'm sure you guys have all been to the Public Works complex by now, but the fleet operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| will be in a much improved facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| They're looking good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| All right, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2397)|

| 0:41:24| Yes, Mayor Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| We have four of these in front of us and Dr. Lyons and I had a conversation not only about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| TIFs and pilots but over the fact that I've been getting some questions over the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| that some of these projects which are being sold by the developers and the people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| asking questions on whether or not the taxes have to be repaid at that time or is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| a way to handle that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| So if you would sort of share with the rest of Council our conversation, we would appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| Be glad to, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| Yes, we did discuss that and our position on this has always been the City's interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| is in the development of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| It is not in retention of ownership and to constrain an owner to not be able to sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2522)|
| 0:42:08| would make a difficult development situation and loan situation even that much more difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| and we don't see that the City has any stake in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| A few of them have sold, you're right, and we have received some questions but unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| there is a provision in the pilot that has to do with some kind of performance, we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| not tie it to and that would have to be maintained by a subsequent owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| We don't tie it to ownership and we haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| As you know, TIFs involve almost always the sale of the property right away and then subsequent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| Pilots usually involve the retention of ownership by the developer or the building owner right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2566)|
| 0:42:47| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| Yes, thank you Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| I think David is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| I would like to ask David to come and address a couple of questions that I have and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2570)|
| 0:42:56| to, just about the status of the property, it seems that this development is nearly done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2576)|
| 0:43:02| and kind of give us an update on how we got here and address the statement that is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2582)|
| 0:43:08| our packet about workforce housing and how you are going to, just what your strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2588)|
| 0:43:15| is for workforce housing for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| David Dewhurst, 123 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| This is the Fish and Electric building which is out on McCalla Avenue, kind of right at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| the very end of Jackson as you go out east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| It was a project that we sort of contemplated back and actually first submitted for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2611)|
| 0:43:38| project back in early 2016 and we have gone through kind of a number of iterations trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2618)|
| 0:43:46| to decide, you know, just what we could build and how we could build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| It actually started off as a project that we were looking at doing from a maker's workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| which, boy there's many days I wish maybe we would have gone that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2636)|
| 0:44:03| And I'd say that this project has kind of gotten held up and twisted around by a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| It does sit in the redevelopment zone that was created for that area and it is the, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| pretty sure it is the first mixed use building that's kind of started in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2652)|
| 0:44:19| And we have, we encountered a variety of different things but I just kind of want to share three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2659)|
| 0:44:25| things with you that kind of postponed us getting here until today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| And the first of which is an odd issue that we spent some time with development staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| on and I think we're actually still working to get it cleared up and it oddly is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2673)|
| 0:44:38| a title issue that was entered into the whole redevelopment zone back when this was an urban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| renewal project back in the early 1960s and it had to do with language, this is very archaic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2682)|
| 0:44:49| language that actually prohibited mixed use applications in that particular redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2689)|
| 0:44:55| zone which dated to that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| And I think that condition still exists and we got through it with a title exemption issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2697)|
| 0:45:03| and it is something that we probably need to hammer out and it's just difficult because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2703)|
| 0:45:10| I don't understand all the legal ramifications to it but that alone kind of held us up in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2710)|
| 0:45:16| terms of thinking whether we would get this project started at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| In the meantime, we've got the application for the pilot trying to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| The next issue which delayed us in kind of getting the pilot going was really also whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2724)|
| 0:45:30| or not, I learned a lot of things about developing next to creeks and I didn't know what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2730)|
| 0:45:37| word riparian meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| You have a cattle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| And I do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| And that was a little, it took me some time to digest that and to work with engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| to get that done and I was still actually telling development staff, kind of asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2747)|
| 0:45:53| them if they would actually hold off on moving the pilot application forward while we understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2753)|
| 0:45:59| exactly what would be required of us from a site standpoint and how that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| In this particular case, the riparian zone actually went into the interior of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2764)|
| 0:46:10| and we got through that issue and I have to say I'm really pleased with the way that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2770)|
| 0:46:17| actually finally turning out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| The last issue was, and again I'll take responsibility for this issue in terms of, at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2779)|
| 0:46:28| we had actually started some work on the project going forward without the TIF being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2788)|
| 0:46:33| voted on and that was, frankly that was a risk on my part, it was a huge leap of good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2793)|
| 0:46:40| faith on my bank's part and it was something I had to consider because I had a construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2800)|
| 0:46:46| crew that was sitting around and I certainly didn't want to lay them off so I took the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| gamble that we would figure out the last step and that was, this was the very first project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| to go through the new third party review system and first we sort of waited on while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2815)|
| 0:47:04| they were looking at the first two TIF projects and when they finished those and they took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| a lot longer than I guess everybody had thought to get the review done and figure out how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| to get that done, then they took a look at the first pilot and we were going on five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2833)|
| 0:47:18| months of that review process and that didn't just got finished like literally a week or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2838)|
| 0:47:24| two ago, which is why this was the very first date that we could be here and you know I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2844)|
| 0:47:32| kind of, you learn a lot when you go through something the very first time. I do know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2852)|
| 0:47:39| it is a process that I, that I, dearly relish, is that the word? Well, truthfully as a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2859)|
| 0:47:48| I wish maybe it was time consuming and difficult, but I know that going through it now the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2868)|
| 0:47:56| time it will be much faster and I think getting through we can make much better decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| and I take a lot of that on about the responsiveness and trying to understand what they were asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2881)|
| 0:48:07| me for. I use a very pretty simple one page performa for our projects. These guys use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2887)|
| 0:48:14| the most, I mean it looks like NASA scientific work going on. It is like a 40 page document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2894)|
| 0:48:19| with all kinds of run outs over 30 years and they are peppering me with questions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2899)|
| 0:48:26| you know what happens in year 22 of the depreciation and I am like, I don't know. So anyway, point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2906)|
| 0:48:35| is that is what, it has been a learning curve. Aren't you a nuclear engineer by training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2915)|
| 0:48:44| No ma'am, I was an aerospace engineer. Aerospace. Wouldn't that have been easier than this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| You should have made an airport. Aerospace. Yeah, there are days I maybe wish I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2929)|
| 0:48:57| have stuck with it. That is actually not true. I have, you just reminded me of how lucky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2937)|
| 0:49:04| I am not to be an aerospace engineer. Anyway, I hope, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2944)|
| 0:49:12| Address the workforce, I mean are you setting aside a certain number of units or are you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2952)|
| 0:49:18| just saying it is just in a general area for workforce housing, affordable housing or is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| it anything formal that this pilot is tied to or is it just in a general that this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| what our intentions are. I just didn't know exactly how that was going to be tied down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| or if it is at all. I don't know, I am just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| Yes, I think Don and Michelle could probably answer the second part of that better because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| we have now entered the world, we are no longer an aerospace engineer, we are in the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| of Mark Mamentoff which is way beyond. I was going to say all kinds of bad things about Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2983)|
| 0:49:54| Don Michelle Foster, Director, Office of Redevelopment. We have been working with David in regards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=2994)|
| 0:50:00| to getting 10 units of that 34 total being at reduced rates and we will be working with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3000)|
| 0:50:07| Mark Mamentoff to have some kind of agreement made in order to have that done, have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3007)|
| 0:50:13| process with these units. For the full 18 years of the pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3013)|
| 0:50:20| Yes, is it 15 or 18? We are looking at 18 years with this agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| in place for those 10 units to be at reduced rates during the term of the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3024)|
| 0:50:31| Okay, well let me say, when I filled out the very first application for this, we actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3031)|
| 0:50:42| built this project as a workforce development project, actually termed it that in the very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| first things we did before any of this came out. Part of that was because that is, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| designed it that way given its location, given the type of building it is, but also because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3052)|
| 0:50:58| in downtown Knoxville the biggest number of potential tenants fall into that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3058)|
| 0:51:06| So we didn't design a super large building or certainly any kind of luxury structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| We designed it with the units and amenities that would actually fit for those kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| folks and that kind of budget. We felt like we needed to do it because we were out in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3075)|
| 0:51:21| an area that is, there is not really much residential around it at all and so we kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| of purposely, yes, I feel like the entire building is really a workforce development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| building so I have never been sort of afraid of that because that is exactly what we designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| it for. Okay, all right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| Thank you, Councilman Dallavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| Yes, I appreciate your struggles there talking about this. I am just trying to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| that last point. It is 15 years if you don't do the 10 dedicated set-asides and it is 18| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| years if you do to make the numbers work. Is that how I should read this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| Well, I can tell you the way I read it, which was, I think the city staff was like, David,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3116)|
| 0:52:04| we would really like you to do it this way. So I said, we will do it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| So you are feeling like 18 is coming down the road and Mark Mamatov is going to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| it happen, is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| Go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| David's project is a little bit unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| I am so sorry. I am Mark Mamatov, 1215 Great Oaks Way, Knoxville, Tennessee. I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3144)|
| 0:52:30| first of all to vouch for David in terms of he was our guinea pig on the third-party review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| process. He would have been in front of this body under our prior process at least six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| months ago probably or five months ago and he did have a huge learning curve in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3160)|
| 0:52:46| of pro formas and things like that. But in terms of the workforce housing, I don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3166)|
| 0:52:53| to mislead you all. We are working through the details of that. It will be in the pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| lease between the IDB and David's company. It is not a document between the city. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| are still working through what exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| The duration is 15 years without the 10 special units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| The pilot will be 18 years and if he does not meet the workforce housing requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| that are going to be in the pilot lease, he will get a shorter abatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| Certainly no longer than 15 years and I am sure David is going to negotiate with us but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3196)|
| 0:53:22| it will probably be in the 12 to 15 year range if he is not able to comply. He won't lose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| the pilot, at least this is our recommendation, if he fails to comply with the workforce housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3207)|
| 0:53:33| The workforce housing limitations likely will be rent restrictions, not KCDC style income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3213)|
| 0:53:40| verification. I see we have developer night out tonight. Most of the developers that do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3220)|
| 0:53:48| like David are not well equipped to do income verification. That is the sort of thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| Don, Michelle and Bill and I will need to work through with them as we try to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| My role here was helping the city through KCDC as their counsel to do these third party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| valuations because of our work and I saw Tim here on that. It really was kind of hard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3243)|
| 0:54:08| translate the TIF third party review for a pilot because they are just not exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3248)|
| 0:54:14| the same fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| Well, thank you for working positively towards getting it resolved, I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| You will see the same thing in another pilot coming up that is also committed to workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| so I hope we can maybe give you more details then on how exactly it would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| David, do you prefer the creek going through the building to this right here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| Yes, first of all I would like to say it is in District 6 and I am happy to see a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3273)|
| 0:54:39| that has been empty for so long is going to be possibly occupied pretty soon. Would this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3279)|
| 0:54:46| be considered affordable housing? Does it fall in that category? Either one of you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3286)|
| 0:54:53| answer that or Don, Michelle you can answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| It is not technically, there are various definitions at income levels and this would not fill in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| the typical affordable or would be low income, the area that low income tax credits go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3301)|
| 0:55:09| but there is a label workforce that is at a certain level that this would be with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| keeps it below market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| Workforce would be a little bit above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| It would be, if you had gradations that would be somewhat above low income or what would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| classically be called affordable by most definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| Alright, in a way it is going to be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| Also it says a commercial piece in that building in addition to the housing. Does anyone know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3332)|
| 0:55:39| yet what type of commercial business are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| That has got to be David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3344)|
| 0:55:49| Partially. You know we have a design standard in what we do is that on every kind of area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3349)|
| 0:55:56| that faces a sidewalk we want to put in an interactive use. Retail certainly if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3356)|
| 0:56:03| In this building it had basically three units that kind of came out and faced McCalla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3363)|
| 0:56:11| So we have developed the units, they can be put together, they can be separate and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| are designed for some type of street level retail interactive use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| I can tell you that right now we are working with, many of you may know that on the Hunter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3382)|
| 0:56:27| Block of Gay Street there was a tiny little gallery called Gallery 1010 that was sponsored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| by the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| It is for students and it is where they can go in there and do all kinds of art programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3393)|
| 0:56:38| and what not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| That studio had to move off Gay Street and I am confident that they are going to be one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3401)|
| 0:56:47| of the three commercial users in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3407)|
| 0:56:52| The other two we still have a ways to go to actually finish construction on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3412)|
| 0:56:57| But that is at least one of the three and I think that will add a lot of street activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| and vitality to the corner down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| David, I just wanted to say that again as Mayor Brown was saying the building stood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3424)|
| 0:57:12| empty for quite some time and I think that if any of the council members get a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3432)|
| 0:57:17| you ought to go down and take a look at it because I think you have done a really nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| job for a building and especially on that corner and all that you have done and so you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| should be commended for moving in that direction and moving into that area in order to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3443)|
| 0:57:29| affordable housing on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| I just have to say my partner Mark Hines deserves lots and lots of credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3453)|
| 0:57:39| He should have been here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| He is trying to get his architectural CLE right now or else he would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3463)|
| 0:57:50| That guy is pretty special and he did a masterful job I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| He really is nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| I would just like to add to go back to Vice Mayor Grieve's original question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3474)|
| 0:58:00| This is indicative of an arrangement that even if there were a sale that would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| to be consistent with the agreement here that would have to be carried because that is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| our interest is rather than exactly who owns it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| Not that David has indicated he is going to sell it but that would be an example of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| what would apply and what our interest would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3505)|
| 0:58:26| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| 11M is a resolution authorizing the Industrial Development Board of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| to negotiate and accept from Smith Hamacher Enterprises LLC or its affiliates payments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3511)|
| 0:58:37| in lieu of ad valorem taxes with respect to real and personal property located at 901| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3517)|
| 0:58:43| East Summit Hill Drive, parcel ID number 095AJ003 and finding that such payments are deemed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3523)|
| 0:58:50| to be in the furtherance of the public purposes of the Board as defined in Tennessee Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| Annotated Section 7-53-305.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| Councilman Delavan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| Don, Michelle, this sounds really exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| It's like we're at the opening shot of Silicone Holler or something here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3547)|
| 0:59:08| Could you tell us just a little bit about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| But I mean it's written up as if this is going to be the start of some real electronic know-how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3550)|
| 0:59:18| in our midst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3558)|
| 0:59:19| Don, Michelle Foster, Director, Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| Yes, this is another vacant building on the east range of downtown that we're actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3562)|
| 0:59:29| getting someone to repurpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| Smith & Hamacher, they're looking to renovate the old Fort Hill building into a Tier 3 data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3570)|
| 0:59:37| center with office space and commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| We do have Frank Hutcherson here and Butch Smith here from Smith & Hamacher to tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| a little bit more about the Tier 3 data center and what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3584)|
| 0:59:50| This is Palo Alto South or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| What is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| Frank Hutcherson, actually 3465 Drayton Drive, Roswell, Georgia as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| So Tier 3 data center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| So it's kind of getting into the Silicon Valley a little bit, but what's really unique about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| it is when you look at Tennessee and even in the southeast and you talk about where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| do people house their data and is it secure, number one, from a physical perspective and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| is it redundant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| It all comes into power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| It has to do with power and cooling and all those different types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| When you look at Tennessee, you really have to go to Nashville and they've got several,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| like five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| A lot of people are going to Nashville and want to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| I'm not talking the Google that you've heard in Clarksville because that's a private type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| of thing and the public can't access that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| We're talking about where businesses can go in and house their data and do their production| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3635)|
| 1:00:40| and their backups and it can be secure and they can run the episodes that way and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| know that technically it's not supposed to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| When you get into the tiered levels, and I'm not going to go through the whole thing for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| you on that because I would put you all to sleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| You'll put us into tears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3652)|
| 1:00:53| I would put you to tears and a deep coma, actually, but essentially when you get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3653)|
| 1:00:59| a tier three type of data center, what that means in a nutshell is that's when you start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| getting into the big time, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| So in Tennessee, Nashville has one and the way it's provisioned from a power perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3665)|
| 1:01:10| is nowhere close to what we're talking with KUB and TVA to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3670)|
| 1:01:14| So we're calling the project the Fort, which you see in your packets, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| So we're literally going to build a fort for data in that perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| You have to go to Atlanta, you have to go possibly to Charlotte, maybe even Miami to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3682)|
| 1:01:28| get anything comparable to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| So the idea here is that we're going to be able to put Knoxville on the map from a data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3689)|
| 1:01:34| center perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| We're going to attract new business wanting to come here because when you couple that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| with UT and Oak Ridge and the science and technology and their vision of being a top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| 100 school, you add in the ability for us with the commercial real estate end of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| in the building itself, and then the data center itself, when you add all that together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| we give a very rich environment to bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| So this is more than just a place for local businesses to store their data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3714)|
| 1:01:59| This might be the added element that helps attract another business to locate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| Any business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| The great thing about data centers is you can put your data anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| You can be located in California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| If you have a place that is like Knoxville, for instance, just to give you a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3730)|
| 1:02:16| great things about it, which you already know, but you're five hours from 75% of the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| You've got the mountain stopping weather coming in, increment weather coming in from the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3741)|
| 1:02:27| That's very attractive for anybody in the country to want to put something in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| Plus the average temperature is about 86 degrees throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| So it doesn't get very hot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| And when you want that, the data itself, when you have these data centers, they produce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| a lot of heat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| So they need the energy to cool it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| They need the energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| They need the cooling and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| So Knoxville is a prime location for that, to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| So to answer your question, yes, it is very attractive, not just for local businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3767)|
| 1:02:52| to put their data in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3772)|
| 1:02:53| I would say even statewide, nationally, possibly even internationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| At the tier three designation, we can attract some international people as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3777)|
| 1:03:01| What that means is when you see that and you have the ability to put commercial real estate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| along with that on the property, then you can have companies wanting to locate in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| house their data and be right there with their data and be able to go down, touch it, feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| it, whatever they need to do, and get the benefits of the KUB TVA power elements that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| Well, thank you for exploring this option and proposing this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| It sounds like it has a nice future for both your company and our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| I think it's going to be fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| Thank you all for the consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3811)|
| 1:03:32| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3812)|
| 1:03:33| And go back to Don Michelle's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3813)|
| 1:03:34| In the packet, it's mentioned fencing around the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| So a couple of years ago, when KPD was wanting to fence around their property, it was quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| a bit of outcrop in the neighborhood that it was going to look too institutionalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3822)|
| 1:03:49| So I just wondered what's being addressed with that fence, and is it going to match| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| up and look like some of the other stuff along Summit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| Yes, we were concerned about that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| We wanted to make sure that Mr. Hutchison and Mr. Smith had a conversation with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| department as well as engineering in regards to the look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| We know what we want and expect for that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| We don't want a barbed wire, we don't want chain link fencing as well, and they're very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| So we did make it aware to them that we wanted something aesthetically pleasing to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3854)|
| 1:04:20| and give the neighborhood a good feel for their building as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| If I could add to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| We're looking to put it, it's going to have columns along with the fencing in between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3871)|
| 1:04:32| It's going to have to be high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| We have to do that for a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| One, from aesthetic and the redevelopment, it looks like the fort, so it'll have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| kind of a fort, kind of a theme, if you will, in that perspective, as far as the stone and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| the fencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3882)|
| 1:04:43| But it also has to have safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3883)|
| 1:04:44| We can't have people climbing over because we also have a lot of power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| There's a lot of things that are going to be out there that could be dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| So we've got to have it high enough that we've got to be protective, protect the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3889)|
| 1:04:53| It's not razor wire and barbed wire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| No, I was thinking chicken wire and some chicken wire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| No, actually, it's going to be nice fencing along with the columns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| It was a big deal a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3901)|
| 1:05:02| It doesn't seem like it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| But, I mean, the KPD responded favorably, and I'm glad you all are as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| And our goal is to put it all around Summit Hill Avenue as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| Sounds really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| If there are any doubts, go to Newark, New Jersey, and don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| That's what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3914)|
| 1:05:15| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3915)|
| 1:05:16| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| Who would want to go to Newark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| Yes, reading the packet, you had some nice salaries of people who would be manning that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3923)|
| 1:05:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| Will you be hiring local people, or will you be recruiting people to come in, or a combination?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3925)|
| 1:05:32| Most likely it will be a combination with an emphasis on local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| The people who are working there now, we have about seven people now, all local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3935)|
| 1:05:40| Myself, I'm from Atlanta, but I come here and work, and so I would be here if my son| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| wasn't in high school and trying to finish up, but I'm here three days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| We're hiring the people that we have from a security perspective, from the physical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| security side, the IT infrastructure team that would be there, the facility managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| Most I'd say about 85-90% of those are going to be local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| And those jobs, as you mentioned in the packet, they're very high-paying jobs in IT and technical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3959)|
| 1:06:05| jobs that we're looking to bring here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| And if I could add the other part of that, as he mentioned a little bit earlier, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| real benefit on it, which we can't put a number on, is the intangible jobs that could be brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3971)|
| 1:06:17| here because of this data center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| That's where we really see the benefit for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| Hopefully the chamber will pick up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| Yeah, they've been fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3984)|
| 1:06:25| Doug Lawyers, we've been working very hand-in-hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| Michelle, all of us have been working really closely together on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| And we're going to, I'd say, exploit it once it gets going, yeah, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3990)|
| 1:06:35| Thank you, Mr. Hutchison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| Good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| 11N is the resolution authorizing the Industrial Development Board of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| to negotiate and accept from Orange-Knoxville-Cumberland LLC payments in lieu of ad valorem taxes with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4010)|

| 1:07:05| Code Annotated Section 7-53-305.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4028)|
| 1:07:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4029)|
| 1:07:10| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4030)|

| 1:07:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4033)|

| 1:07:42| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4062)|
| 1:07:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4066)|

| 1:07:49| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| Mayor, if I could ask one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4070)|
| 1:07:54| Is this project, I guess David's gone, or is he still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| Is this going to have to wait until the bridge is done, or can you work simultaneously with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| that T-DOT bridge that's going to be under construction for two or three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4081)|
| 1:08:07| Again, David Dewhurst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| No, fortunately, this building fronts Oak Hill Viaduct, and so we got lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4089)|
| 1:08:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| And I just want to recognize our Office of Redevelopment staff, our law department, all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4100)|
| 1:08:26| the folks who worked with these developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| These are four good projects we're talking about right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| A lot of momentum continuing, and good work from our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4111)|
| 1:08:36| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| I think that third party review is a help, too, because you get to see a different perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| on the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| 12A is an ordinance amending Ordinance No. 0-575-97 so as to adjust the salary of Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4124)|
| 1:08:51| members to $2,000 per month effective the third Saturday of December 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4131)|
| 1:08:56| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4136)|
| 1:08:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4139)|
| 1:09:00| Now she's finally here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4140)|
| 1:09:01| We've talked about this subject for at least the last, we as a Council, during the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4141)|
| 1:09:13| hearings, and the Council part of it at the very end, we've kicked this can down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4153)|
| 1:09:21| for at least three years, I think it has been, I could be mistaken, maybe even longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4161)|
| 1:09:28| But I feel like it's time for us to move forward this and just see what the temperature of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4168)|
| 1:09:35| the Council is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| I mean, obviously, it would raise the salaries of Council members, but most importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4177)|
| 1:09:45| it would not raise the salary of any of the five members that are going off, nor the four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4185)|
| 1:09:52| remaining Council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| It would not take effect until, if approved, until January of 2019, and see Jim out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4195)|
| 1:10:02| he'd be proud of that, so we can budget for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| The next Vice Mayor can budget for that, as they should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4205)|
| 1:10:12| A couple of things to note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| We had our City Recorder do some background on this, and I think it's important to note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4213)|
| 1:10:20| that it's been 20 years since there has been an adjustment in the salaries of Council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4220)|
| 1:10:30| We did do, with the help, as I said, with the City Recorder, we looked at bike cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4230)|
| 1:10:37| With the exception of Nashville, we were behind, we were on par with those in Nashville, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4237)|
| 1:10:43| Nashville, Metro Nashville, is somewhat unique in that they have, I think, 40 to 42 Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4243)|
| 1:10:50| members, so from a budgetary standpoint, I can understand why theirs is at $19,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4250)|
| 1:10:57| That's a whole busload of Council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4257)|
| 1:10:58| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4258)|
| 1:10:59| It's a lot of Council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4259)|
| 1:11:00| God bless whoever says, it's like the General Assembly, but, and I'll point out Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4260)|
| 1:11:08| from my feeble memory, it seems like their salaries were at $24,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4268)|
| 1:11:16| The Vice Mayor, actually, I think, was at $27,000, and I certainly wouldn't advocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4276)|
| 1:11:22| that separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4282)|
| 1:11:23| I think that could be problematic for Council members, and I'm not advocating for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4283)|
| 1:11:31| It's expensive, not super expensive, but it's expensive to hold office, and after all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4291)|
| 1:11:38| experience that these City members have, I think it would be, you all would agree, with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4298)|
| 1:11:45| the wear and tear on your car, the gasoline that you use going to the various events that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4305)|
| 1:11:51| we all attend citywide, and all the neighborhood meetings, buying the ads, buying the breakfast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4311)|
| 1:12:01| tickets, the lunch tickets, and all the things, and it's expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4321)|
| 1:12:07| We don't do this to make money, but it shouldn't cost money to hold this office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4327)|
| 1:12:19| So, I mean, I think that it's a fair ask, and I think it's a good use of taxpayers'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4339)|
| 1:12:35| money to fund this and to get us equal with peers, and I would challenge the next Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4355)|
| 1:12:44| to not wait 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4364)|
| 1:12:45| I think that you should, you know, well, the Mayor's seat, for example, was, it had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4365)|
| 1:12:52| been so long a time, and then, you know, people look, well, good gosh, you're going up $4,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4372)|
| 1:12:57| but if you amortize that over 20 years, then that's not a huge increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4377)|
| 1:13:03| So I think it's fair, and I want to say, too, I want to be careful here, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4383)|
| 1:13:10| I want to point out that when you look at the most recent Council members going back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4390)|
| 1:13:16| the last 20, 25 years or so, I would say, for the most part, that most of the members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4396)|
| 1:13:24| have been either retired and could afford to hold the office, and, or the ones that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4404)|
| 1:13:35| are still in the workforce own their own businesses, I want to say middle class folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4415)|
| 1:13:43| to upper middle class and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| And I think that this, perhaps this increase could give the working person a chance to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4426)|
| 1:13:55| hold this office in that you might be in sales, and the time that you would spend away going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4435)|
| 1:14:03| to the Cumberland Avenue ribbon cutting or the various things that we have to do during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4443)|
| 1:14:08| the middle of the day that takes away from that time, that that extra money could open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4448)|
| 1:14:14| up doors to people of lesser means and have a little bit more diverse economically, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4454)|
| 1:14:25| you will, of Council people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| So, you know, that's kind of subjective, I don't know that that could happen, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4467)|
| 1:14:33| it could help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| And I think it could help folks who teeter, perhaps get on, you know, throw their hat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4474)|
| 1:14:41| in the ring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| And I'll never forget Councilman Della Vopi, and you may or may not remember this, when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| you ran the first time, and it was one of the most on-spot statements that I ever heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4487)|
| 1:14:55| anybody say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4495)|
| 1:14:56| And his opponent at the time had made the statement during a forum that that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4496)|
| 1:15:05| was going to donate the whole salary to worthy causes, and I think that's, you know, my hats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4505)|
| 1:15:12| off to that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| But I'll never forget Councilman Della Vopi's response, and he said, I'm going to take that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| money and I'm going to earn every penny of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| And we do earn every penny of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| So, you know, I'll get off my soapbox, I hope that my members of Council will agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4524)|
| 1:15:30| with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4530)|
| 1:15:31| If you don't, that's fine, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| But I have moved it forward, and I see the Vice Mayor, I see several lights on, so I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4534)|
| 1:15:39| yield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4539)|
| 1:15:40| Vice Mayor Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4541)|
| 1:15:42| I'm not going to repeat a lot of things that you said, Nick, because I think you're right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4542)|
| 1:15:46| on with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4546)|
| 1:15:47| But I also recall when we first went on, remember, Hulk was brought this up in terms of having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| a raise, and that was eight years ago that he talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| And I do agree with a lot of the comments that you had to say about, you know, really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| opening it up and having a more diverse Council, which I think is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4560)|
| 1:16:05| I also think that, I know I've talked to several of my constituents, and they're kind of surprised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4565)|
| 1:16:11| that there hasn't been a raise since the 90s, considering knowing about the amount of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4571)|
| 1:16:16| that all of us do and put forth, just like you said, in terms of expenses and this sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| One thing that I do want to emphasize also, which you mentioned, is that I think we ought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4582)|
| 1:16:27| to come up with a way, not to take away from this particular resolution tonight, but that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4587)|
| 1:16:33| we ought to come up with a way in which Council salaries should be increased, whether it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4593)|
| 1:16:38| a percentage or if it's a portion of whatever the Mayor makes or something like that, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4598)|
| 1:16:43| that future Council members don't have to go through this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| That we ought to be able to develop some kind of a scale or system in which that can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4611)|
| 1:16:52| But I signed on to this, and I fully support it, and once again, I know that all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| have kind of talked about this, and we've beat around the bush, and I'm glad that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4616)|
| 1:17:01| put it forward, and I do support it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4624)|
| 1:17:05| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4625)|
| 1:17:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4626)|
| 1:17:07| One of the things to consider is that the City Council is the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4627)|
| 1:17:14| We approve the budget of the City, it's a $180 million budget, there are 1,500, or around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4634)|
| 1:17:20| $180 million, and there are 1,500 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| We deal with land uses and a lot of very technical kinds of things that require some pretty intense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4644)|
| 1:17:31| study and a big learning curve in many cases, and so we want people who will want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4651)|
| 1:17:39| the job, but we also need to be very aware that we don't just show up on alternate Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4659)|
| 1:17:44| nights and sit here and talk for a little while, and then go on home and come back the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4664)|
| 1:17:49| next two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| So there's a lot of responsibility and action required with this City Council position that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4671)|
| 1:17:59| you don't really think about until you get into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| When I ran, I didn't think a whole lot about land uses, and I didn't realize the intensity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4682)|
| 1:18:07| of land use with City Council actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4687)|
| 1:18:11| So I will be supporting this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4693)|
| 1:18:14| I would just like to add before we call for the vote that I appreciate that Council is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| looking forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| You know, none of you will benefit from this, and the new Council members that come on won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4699)|
| 1:18:26| have that increase for two years either, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| So it's going to be two years before this, more than two years before this becomes effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4708)|
| 1:18:34| So I think it says a lot about this Council that you're looking, it's nothing that benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| you, but you're looking at how this will better serve the city in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4718)|
| 1:18:43| So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4727)|
| 1:18:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4728)|
| 1:18:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4730)|

| 1:19:59| some other donors to get involved and allow, create a vehicle for citizens to give back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170801?start=4799)|
