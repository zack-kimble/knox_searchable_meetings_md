| 0:00:34| First thing on our agenda is our devotional, and the chair recognizes Commissioner Evelyn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=34)|
| 0:00:38| Gill from the 1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=38)|
| 0:00:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=40)|
| 0:00:42| It is my honor to introduce Yassin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=42)|
| 0:00:44| Would you come to the podium, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=44)|
| 0:00:47| He's going to give some words of wisdom for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=47)|
| 0:00:50| He is our friend, our advocate, and our neighbor, and I'm so very honored to have him here speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=50)|
| 0:00:55| before County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=55)|
| 0:00:57| And this is your first opportunity, so we are so very honored to have you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=57)|
| 0:01:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=62)|
| 0:01:03| As-salamu alaykum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=63)|
| 0:01:05| I'm thankful for all of the NAC's commissure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=65)|
| 0:01:09| Special thanks to Commissioner Evelyn Gill for inviting me to be with you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=69)|
| 0:01:16| I decide to start with as-salamu alaykum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=76)|
| 0:01:19| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=79)|
| 0:01:21| It means peace be upon you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=81)|
| 0:01:25| Because any community in any country without peace and love will not be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=85)|
| 0:01:33| Today, I want to share some of the things I learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=93)|
| 0:01:40| First of all, I learned how to be a better person, and I learned how hard work can pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=100)|
| 0:01:52| off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=112)|
| 0:01:53| I learned how to spread difficult politics from the good people that make this country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=113)|
| 0:02:02| work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| I learned that the status of liberty is about helping and providing love and freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=123)|
| 0:02:13| I learned the mayor, the NAC's city commissure, and everyone else in this government can provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=133)|
| 0:02:20| help to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=140)|
| 0:02:22| Instead of robbing them dry like they do in my country where I come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=142)|
| 0:02:29| I learned that members of our military and first responders are heroes, not a tool they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=149)|
| 0:02:38| use against the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| I learned that we all come from somewhere, that this is a nation of immigrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=160)|
| 0:02:51| We are going to build this country together, hand by hand and shoulder by shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=171)|
| 0:02:58| I have learned a lot of good things here, and I'm very thankful that I can be a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=178)|
| 0:03:05| person because of you, because of your heart, because you are the people of this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=185)|
| 0:03:15| And maybe not be able to say bees correctly, but I learned how to make it from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=195)|
| 0:03:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| Did I see a light on over here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| How can we get one of your restaurants in the Fountain City North area all the way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=213)|
| 0:03:42| Cedar Bluff Saturday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| We would love to have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=225)|
| 0:03:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| Peace through falafel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| Thank you so much for being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| So as we begin to always like to begin these meetings, I know we often have folks from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=232)|
| 0:03:59| our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| This may be your first County Commission meeting, and you may be watching it on TV, and it might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| be the first time that you've ever tuned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| So just to sort of kind of lay out the lay of the land, so to speak, the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=245)|
| 0:04:11| has two formal meetings each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| Usually they're the third and fourth Mondays of each month, although sometimes with holidays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| they do get shifted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| At last week's meeting, we did our first pass through the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| We discussed almost everything on the agenda, and I've put the majority of the items on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| our consent agenda tonight so that many of the items that were debated last week will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| be voted on tonight through two different larger votes, although we do have two discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=274)|
| 0:04:40| items that are on the agenda tonight that are going to be moved up to the front of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| So as we work it through it, we've got public forum, and we've had, you know, I think I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=286)|
| 0:04:53| got about eight folks who've expressed an interest in speaking at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| We'll go to that first, although two have recently expressed that they're going to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| their points over to March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| Then we've got honorary resolutions, then, and I'm saying to my fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| then we'll do our two discussion items and then kind of move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| But in the short run, we'll be jumping into the public forum first before we set our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=309)|
| 0:05:15| and then work our way through the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| For our guests who are going to be speaking tonight at public forum, each speaker gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| five minutes, and what I might ask is just when you approach the podium, just make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=321)|
| 0:05:27| that the microphone is close to you and state your name and address clearly for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| and then you've got five minutes, which we do a pretty good, good but fair job trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| to enforce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| So, anyhow, the first person on the agenda for tonight, excuse me, oh, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| I've got to get to the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| I'm just kind of laying down the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| Tonight, before you go to public forum, the pledge, we've got Commissioner Justin Biggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| Everyone join me for the pledge of allegiance to our nation's flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| Salute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=361)|
| 0:06:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| I was so inspired at the beginning of the meeting, I kind of got off my line here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| So, back to public forum, and thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| Todd Fromeyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| Todd, if you could please approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| Todd Fromeyer, 1551 Lawrence Glen Lane, Knoxville, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=388)|
| 0:06:34| Mr. Chairman, Commissioners, thank you for the opportunity to speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| I was doing research on another matter, and I came across an article in the Compass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| It said that in May 2018, the Commission had approved a contract in the amount of $265,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| for a sidewalk master plan for Knox County to identify priorities and long-range improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| In the fall of that year, shortly after Mayor Jacobs came into office, Knox County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| canceled the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| According to the Compass article, Jim Snowden, the county's senior director of engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| and public works, said the $265,000 that had been budgeted for the study would be spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| instead on sidewalk construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| Fast forward to last week, I attended the Commission's working session and noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| the resolution sponsored by Commissioner Nystrom and Mayor Jacobs to approve an appropriation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| in the amount of $200,000 from the general fund balance to the Knoxville Chamber in support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| of their new strategic vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| Based on a vote of the Commission, the resolution was added to the consent part of today's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| and Chairman Nystrom offered the opportunity to all of the Commissioners to be co-sponsors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| of the resolution, which you all apparently agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| The next day, I learned more about this appropriation from the Compass in their daily email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| It noted that the fellow who spoke on that resolution was none other than the new Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| Chamber CEO, Mike Odom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| It looks like the money is earmarked for Innovation Valley, which is, as you know, a regional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| economic development partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| It appears that Innovation Valley was slated to get $400,000 in the budget, but the Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| cut this amount in half until he got to see the direction of the Chamber's new leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| Now, this $200,000 from the resolution is to get Innovation Valley back up to the originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=481)|
| 0:08:07| planned $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| At that point, the thought comes to my head that it's curious that the Mayor and the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=489)|

| 0:08:24| vision for sidewalks and walkability in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| Then I did a little more digging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| I wanted to look into the question of why any money is going to Innovation Valley and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| why so much, so I looked at previous budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| I found that in 2013-14, 2014-15, and 2015-16 budgets, Innovation Valley got $250,000 annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=515)|
| 0:08:44| from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| In 2016-17, they got $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=525)|
| 0:08:48| In 2017-18, they got $350,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| In 2018-19, it went up to $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=531)|
| 0:08:54| Then last year, it went back down to $200,000, except here we have the Commission approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| this extra $200,000 to get them back up to the $400,000 for the current year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| So at this point, I'll give the caveat that I understand the budgeting process is complicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| and I grant that comparing these annual Innovation Valley appropriations every year, ranging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| from $250,000 to $400,000 is a bit of an apples to oranges comparison when looking at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| one-time contract for a sidewalk master plan, even though the amounts are very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| But the more I've looked into this, the more I think the county government's priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| are off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| I think this points to a troubling pattern with this mayor's focus on rewarding business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| and development in Knox County at the expense of ordinary citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| I disagree with this focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| I believe a sidewalk master plan is no less important to the county than the strategic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=575)|
| 0:09:40| vision of the Knoxville Chamber, and if I'm being honest, I probably think it's more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| I believe this is the case if you compare the canceled $265,000 contract for the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| master plan to the $200,000 appropriation that the Commission is going to approve today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=590)|
| 0:09:55| It is especially the case if you look at the fact that the contract would have been a one-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| expenditure of $265,000, and that the county has sent over $2 million to Innovation Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=598)|
| 0:10:04| over the last seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| This is a matter of spending taxpayer money wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| It's about where your priorities lie in spending that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| Now I found it interesting how Mr. Odom was questioned about the Chamber's accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| and its transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| According to the Compass, the Knoxville Chamber's board approved this new strategic vision in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| It appears that the mayor and the Commission have seen this strategic vision, but it won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| be publicly rolled out until April, and that's not a lot of transparency to my mind on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| part of the Chamber or this Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| Now I think most people would agree that $200,000 is a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| I've chosen to compare this appropriation to the canceled contract from 2018 because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| I think it shows how the Jacobs Administration has its priorities wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| I mean, according to Mr. Snowden, the county could build about 3,000 feet of sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| for that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| I doubt there are too many people out there who wouldn't love to see more sidewalks in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| But really, you can pick a lot of items from the budget and say the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| I'd like to see the Commission take seriously the idea of transparency and how taxpayer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| money is spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| I know this resolution is on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| I'm asking the Commission to take this item off of that agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| I do not approve these additional funds to Innovation Valley without some explanation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| for why this additional $200,000 is being spent now and what it's being spent for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=672)|
| 0:11:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| Thank you, Mr. Fromeyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| Next on public forum is Angela Holmberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| I hope I'm pronouncing your name correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| I have some material that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| You can...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| We'll have someone come up and pass it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| And ma'am, if you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| You may want to pull the microphone down a little bit and just say your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| My name is Angela Holmberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| I live at 975 Anatole Lane in Knoxville, 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| My property backs up to a field owned by the Bright family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| They've lived there for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| And beyond that field is a subdivision fairly new called Shiloh Gardens, a single street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| subdivision on Cherish Grace Way, which includes a stormwater retention area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=715)|
| 0:12:01| Stormwater from Pedigo Road near Sharon Baptist Church is directed through culverts to empty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| into that field behind me and flows across the field eventually to the holding area at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| the end of Cherish Grace Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| Prior to the development of Shiloh Gardens, that water kept flowing naturally down the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| hill towards Emery Road and eventually to Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| You'll see in some of those photos some aerial shots of before the development was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=741)|
| 0:12:27| On February 23rd, 2019, just a little over a year ago, my house flooded with 28 inches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=747)|
| 0:12:33| of water that backed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| According to the stormwater engineers in the county, as a result of the spillway in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| retention area being three foot higher than my ground floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| Three of my neighbor's homes also flooded that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| Some of them are here to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| If they want to stand, they can and be recognized behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| Early that morning, I called Knox County Stormwater Office and eventually spoke with Tony Norman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| who said there was nothing that could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| Over the last year, there have been multiple visits by the county staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| My husband and I have personally spoken with Tony Norman, Eddie Roberts, Kathy Olson, Martin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| Pleasant and a number of others and made regular follow-up calls with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=789)|
| 0:13:16| We were told it was the storm of the century, it was a 500-year flood, a 100-year flood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| and it would never happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| Nothing was done to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| On February 6th, 2020, my house flooded again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| I hadn't even finished the repairs from the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| We called Eddie Roberts' office that morning and he did not return our call that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| My uncle, Bruce Williams, called Jim Snowden's office for me and spoke with someone who said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| they were loading pumps right then, they'd be at my house within an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| No one showed up at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| My house flooded again that day a few hours later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| My neighbors and I ran trash pumps all day on the 6th and for several days after to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| the water down because there was prediction of 2 to 4 more inches of water on the 12th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| which would have flooded not only my house again but all of the other homes that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| in the area, the four homes that flooded last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| I'm not here today to ask you to fix my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| What I am asking you is to put priority on fixing this water retention area and fix the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=857)|
| 0:14:23| problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| The county approved the subdivision, the permits and the stormwater plans and there were obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| errors and omissions in those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| There's photos there that show the topography and where the elevation is above my ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=872)|
| 0:14:38| floor for the spillway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| We live with a threat every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| I have a camera in my backyard where I watch the water and make sure that I don't need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| to run home and start up a pump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| I did not have flood insurance and neither did my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| We're not in a flood plain, not even close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| We can't continue to pay to repair our homes over and over again with no hope of getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=898)|
| 0:15:03| this issue resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| My son and my 79-year-old dad live in the downstairs of my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=905)|
| 0:15:11| My dad has nowhere else to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| I've been taking care of him for years and he would not leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| He slept on a sofa on brick for days because we elevated the furniture to try to keep it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| from being damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| Again, I'm asking you to fix the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| There were FEMA funds made available last year when the President declared this a disaster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| area and there should have been funds available to fix this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=931)|
| 0:15:41| Do you have any questions for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=941)|
| 0:15:48| Are all these packets of pictures different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| They're all different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| These are from flooding that happened in April of 2017, February of 2018, February of 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=953)|
| 0:16:03| and then again February of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| This has not been a one-time issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| This has been an ongoing issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| There have been many times when the water has been up to my patio within inches of coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| in my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=973)|

| 0:16:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| It appears there are a couple of commissioners with some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=976)|

| 0:16:22| Angela, when did this water problem start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| When the, I guess, tell me when it really started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=986)|
| 0:16:34| The initial problem when the water started backing up in the field is when the shallow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| garden subdivision was built and the natural flow of the water was blocked from going down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=998)|
| 0:16:44| the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| We had to build an area to build two houses and a driveway across the end that blocked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| the water flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| According to Tony Norman, he said we had a 10-year drought period where there were no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| issues, but now we're out of that drought period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| Some of those pictures on the back, there are some rainfall data, which I've highlighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| of some of the rainfalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| It only takes two days of an inch or two of rain for the water to back up and start coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| in my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| Were you told that there was supposed to have been a culvert and some other things put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| there also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| I was told originally that there should have been a drain in that pond since they blocked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| the natural flow of water and there was no drain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| Some of the county folks that have come out have actually come out a couple of different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| times to unblock the drain and figured out there wasn't a drain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1055)|

| 0:18:07| I'm sorry, Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| What year was Shiloh built, the subdivision that's caused the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| They started the subdivision around 2007, 2008, the first house up at the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| Some of the houses weren't finished until about 2012, 11 or 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1100)|
| 0:18:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| My house was built in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| The Helms house that was also flooded significantly last year was built in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1112)|
| 0:18:38| We had never seen this kind of water until about 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1121)|

| 0:18:46| Next is Mack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| I'm sorry, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| I have a question to some of your other neighbors that are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1128)|
| 0:19:00| Are you experiencing the same level of damage that was described in the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| Could you come to the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| We do have just, Commissioner, we do have, it appears, one, two, three, four other guests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1148)|

| 0:19:27| So if I called your name and you need to speak to this, going in order of sign up, Mack Stahlcup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1167)|

| 0:19:38| I don't think Mack made it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| Is he not here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1180)|

| 0:19:43| Back to you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| I think the gentleman raised his hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| He's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| Is that James?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| No, it's Mack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| Is that Mike Helms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1189)|

| 0:19:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| Mike, I've got you on the list, but I also had a couple of folks who signed up before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| you, so I'll get to you in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| So Mack is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| And James Petras, is James here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| And then Mike, it looks like we're back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| So Mike Helms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1207)|
| 0:20:13| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1213)|
| 0:20:26| My name is Mike Helms, H-E-L-M-S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| I live at 967 Anatole, Knoxville, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1229)|
| 0:20:42| I'm having senior moments right as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| I don't have all the glitz and glamour that Angie's got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| I'm just here to tell you how it impacts individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1250)|
| 0:20:57| I live in the house with my son, my wife, my 91-year-old mother, which originally lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1257)|
| 0:21:03| downstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| And it's a full 1,900-square-foot room with two bedrooms, two baths, and all this other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1265)|
| 0:21:14| This was my dream home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| I'm a retiree from KUB after 36 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| I'm a Vietnam vet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| And the yard is just big enough where a tank of gas will last my lawnmower a whole mowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1282)|
| 0:21:28| season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| That's all I wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| Now I can rent the backyard out to boats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| And that's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| I sat there in the cul-de-sac and watched every rock go in that house, watched every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1296)|
| 0:21:43| piece of wood go on that floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| And then I wake up and I got water in the basement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| That's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| And my son comes upstairs and says, it's damp downstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| He had to take off a full week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| We had to rent pumps at one time with our neighbors in our pump running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1320)|
| 0:22:06| We were pumping 60,000 gallons an hour into the storm drain above the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1326)|
| 0:22:14| And then on top of that, when you're retired, I hate to say this, but I'm on a fixed income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1334)|
| 0:22:22| That's what everybody says, but anyhow, it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| We had to come up with about $3,000 in the first couple of days just to get pumps and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1345)|
| 0:22:32| everything that we needed to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| I don't know what else to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| First 20 years I worked at KUB, I learned right quick, you do not dam up a natural drain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1360)|
| 0:22:47| And that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| We also have another subdivision that was built sometime in the 70s above us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1370)|
| 0:22:56| It's right across the street from Grace Baptist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| There is no storm drains that I know of except that big gap that comes down back in my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1380)|
| 0:23:08| And everything has been tolerated and does good, had no problem until this last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1388)|
| 0:23:16| a year ago today is when the flood hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| And like I say, I worked in water for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| I don't care about water, I can stand in the middle of the rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| But now when I see water, I start trembling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| I'm scared to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| So there's no reason if I live two miles from Beaver Creek up a hill, should I worry about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1416)|
| 0:23:43| flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| And on top of that, have you ever tried to buy flood insurance when you live in an old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| flood plain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| You can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| It took me two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| I don't know how long it took Angie, but it took me two days of calling and talking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1435)|
| 0:24:02| people and I finally found somebody that will sell us flood insurance, $500 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1442)|
| 0:24:13| When FEMA came out, they said that we didn't have the Knox County residents didn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| enough money to get the small interest loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| So I mean to get the free money or whatever that FEMA gave out at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| So we were able to get a small interest loan, took like seven, eight months to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1467)|
| 0:24:36| But we could only get it if we had flood insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| So we finally found flood insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| Now I've got to keep paying $500 a month just for flood insurance and nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1483)|
| 0:24:51| For as long as I have a small business, I mean, yeah, a small business loan, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| who we had to get it through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| So it is a second mortgage on my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| And I said, I'm retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| This thing, everything was in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| Now I know things happen, but not like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| You can plan on death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| You can plan on sickness and all this other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| You don't plan on flood when you don't live in a floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| If I lived down on the Tennessee, I'd plan on flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| But when you live two miles above Beaver Creek, up a hill, that's all I got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1523)|
| 0:25:30| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| I believe Commissioner Anders has a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| I don't have a question, but I did want to ask Jim Snowden a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| I was going to, if we have Jim's, engineer, I'm going to ask the director of engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| a question, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| I just want to, I mean, you've heard what has been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| I know your department has not just turned her eye to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| It's not the way you all do the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| So can you explain a little bit what's going on up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| Yeah, we have been looking into it and certainly sympathize with these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| We're working to find a solution for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| We engaged a flood study back in the summer of last year after the February floods to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| look at root cause analysis and try to find the most cost-effective solution to solve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| this problem as well as the ones at Cedar Bluff, the ones at Dutchtown, the ones at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| Bluegrass Lake, and the ones on Jim Luttrell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| And what we hope to do within the next few weeks or month is actually to meet with these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| folks and present to them what our findings are and what we think may be the best solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| for that, which we feel like the best solution may be to acquire the property that's adjoining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1597)|
| 0:26:45| them and maybe build a larger flood storage area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| There was some thought about taking the water downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| The gentleman immediately downstream flooded too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| So we can't move the problem down to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| So the most logical choice for us would be to contain the water where it's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| And we want to meet with these folks here in the next few weeks now that that flood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| study is coming to a conclusion to try to find, you know, a solution that not only fits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1625)|
| 0:27:10| what we think is good, but also what they think is good long-term for their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| Thank you, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| Well, seeing these pictures are just absolutely devastating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| I grew up right in Herald Hills and Fountain City area, and we always had to pump our basement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1644)|
| 0:27:31| out and see my friends come out and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| So I know what that's like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| I cannot imagine going through it again so soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| So the question is for Mr. Snowden, is this something that has been caused from another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1662)|
| 0:27:52| development that they were talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| You know, Commissioner, and I'd like to see the pictures that the lady gave you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| What we have to go on is the data that's within our GIS system, and it appears that the historical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1682)|
| 0:28:09| topography shows that elevation the same prior to the new subdivision being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1689)|
| 0:28:17| Now, I can't speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| I didn't see it before, but based on the topography that our KGIS folks had, the 1080 elevation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1699)|
| 0:28:26| existed there before the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| So it's, and I think the Miss, I'm sorry, Miss Holmberg, I think her finished floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1709)|
| 0:28:36| is at 1077, and she's exactly correct, there's a three-foot elevation change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| So it's our opinion that that grade existed prior to the construction of that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1721)|
| 0:28:50| Well, obviously these people have their home and they've invested in it, and I suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1730)|
| 0:29:01| that whatever we can do, they've been dealing with it now for way over a year, that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| needs to be a really quick answer for them as our Knox County taxpayers, and it's their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1746)|
| 0:29:13| home, and two of them have their elderly parents and all, I can't, my heart goes out to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1753)|
| 0:29:20| all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| So with the rains that we've been having, obviously this probably, this isn't going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| to be the last time as we've seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| So I would like to know, and I think as all of us as commissioners would really like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1769)|
| 0:29:36| know the progress that goes on this and hope that it goes very quickly, because I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| over a year and two floods like this, if it's something that Knox County is responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| for, we need to really get on it and try to get this taken care of for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| So I'd like to be involved in knowing how this progresses and what we can do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1793)|
| 0:30:01| I mean, it's been way too long really for you all to have to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| This is the first I've heard of it because it's not in my district, but I would be willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| to do whatever we need to do to get this taken care of for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1810)|
| 0:30:16| And that's our hope as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| We want to solve these problems for these folks as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| Next, Mr. Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| Mr. Snowden, was there just maybe some miscommunication as far as when they were under the impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| that pumps were coming to be used in their homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| Was that just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| It must have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| I never spoke with anyone, and to my knowledge, no one in my office spoke with anyone to express| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1836)|
| 0:30:42| to them that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| Because once again, we didn't want to pump downstream because there's a gentleman downstream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| that got flooded also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| We don't want to move the problem just downstream to the next neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| So no, I don't know where that information came from, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| Commissioner Bussler, then Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| Mr. Chairman, Mr. Snowden, we talked about this once before about the driveway that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1859)|
| 0:31:06| in the house that was being built through the codes department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| And that driveway was built up quite a bit, as if you've been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| You know, acts as a damming type effect and pushes that water way back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1873)|
| 0:31:19| Was there supposed to be, there was supposed to have been a culvert in there, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| The design plan for that subdivision, we looked closely at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1883)|
| 0:31:29| We required them to over-excavate the depressed area, but to our review of the plan, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1889)|
| 0:31:36| never was an overflow there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| So that's what we've gleaned to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| There never was a pipe proposed for that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| But that is part of the problem that caused it to back up so far, though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| There's not enough flood storage there prior to it getting into some of these homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| In the future, will there be plans, since we see the effect of a driveway when you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| doing, letting out plans to be built in driveways to show that it will not back up in depressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1923)|
| 0:32:12| areas or natural drainage areas, to let that flow like it's supposed to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| Is there something we can do to make sure that when we're doing those plans and doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| site plans, even for the individual houses, that that's being taken care of in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| And my staff, we try to look at things holistically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| I think this is a case where you have a subdivision that comes in, gets approved, and under its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1949)|
| 0:32:36| plan, everything looks good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| The next plan comes in, everything looks good, and you don't look at it in totality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| So I think that may have been it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| I think we can always look at our processes and find better ways to do plans review, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| certainly this is one of those locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| Max Stahlcup is not here tonight, but one of his problems was it had to do with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| sinkhole where somebody had backfilled in that sinkhole and caused the problem to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| I know it's on private property, but isn't there something we're supposed to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| those sinkholes so they act as a natural drain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| In that particular location, that sinkhole, it's not got a buffer on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| It's not that lot wasn't created with our sinkhole policy as it to dates now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| So technically, we can approach it from a dirty lot ordinance to make sure that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| not dumping brush and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| But as far as having an official buffer and easement on it, those lots were created prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| to our sinkhole policy being adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| So we're a little bit hamstrung in those locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| Thank you, Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| Commissioner Jay and then Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| Mr. Snowden, I'm just looking at KGIS, and I wonder if this is the same area that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| At the end of Cherish Grace Way, which is in that neighborhood, on the historical topography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| maps from 2008 to 2010, it actually shows what looks like an actual pond or retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| pond right on that corner of that neighborhood before the neighborhood was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| And then if I look at an overhead Google map, look at that exact space now, I see a, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| know when this was taken, of course, but I see a house being built literally right next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| to that, what used to be that retention pond, which now looks really filled in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| It doesn't look like a pond now, whether that's because this was taken in dry weather or it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| truly was filled in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Is that the sinkhole area, so to speak, that you're referencing, or is that a true retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| pond that got filled in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| I would have to look specifically at the map you're looking at, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| But I think the sinkhole area is actually further to the north, closer to these residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| I'll take a screen grab and send it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| I just think, I think if I look at, we ought to really consider the old topography maps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| and whether or not, you know, it may have been a neighborhood that, you know, filled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| something in that shouldn't have been, and that, but it's worth looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| I'll send screen grabs your way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| We'll be glad to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| Ms. Holmberg had raised her hand in the back, and I don't know if she had anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| that she wanted to, if that's all right with you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| Ms. Carringer just mentioned calling her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| There was a couple of things that I wanted to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2122)|
| 0:35:30| One is the Bright property, the people that live behind us, they own the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| They've lived there for more than 50 years and owned a lot of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| It was pasture land, and talking with them and interviewing them about the topography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| of the land and what was happening when Cherish Grace was built, I also own a house in North| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2144)|
| 0:35:51| Meadows and bought that property during the time that Cherish Grace was built, but according| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| to the Brights, that water just flowed on down the hill, and some of the maps that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2156)|
| 0:36:02| can see, it does look to me that that property was built up for the driveway where it used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| to flow, if you look at some of the topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| The other thing is that I've heard a little bit about digging out this pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| If you see some of those pictures, there was more than five acres that was flooded that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| was anywhere from two to five foot deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| Digging that pond out is not going to contain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| I'm not a stormwater engineer, but I used to work for an engineering company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| I know a little bit about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| They're not going to dig that out three to four or five foot, and it contained the volume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| of water that was in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| Not only that, it's a health hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| You cannot even go outside in the summertime without getting eat up with mosquitoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| We have to find a solution that gets that water out of there, or we will always live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| in fear and have anxiety that that water is going to back up into our homes again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2212)|
| 0:36:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| Director Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| We're looking at KGIS, and we have Copper Ridge Branch to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| I'm assuming this water flow is not to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| It's to the south back towards Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| Where does this water go to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| Where does it end up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| Does it come back into Copper Ridge Branch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| It actually, there's multiple tiers of sinkholes down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2253)|
| 0:37:40| There's the sinkhole that's in question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| There's a sinkhole immediately downstream, and then there's a much larger sinkhole right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| behind, I can't remember the name of that subdivision, but the first subdivision off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| the corner of Pettigo and Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| It really doesn't ever get to a flowing waterway like Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| That's part of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| It's contained within sinkholes that don't drain off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| As they fill up, and as the groundwater is high, there's limited possibility for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2283)|
| 0:38:09| water to get out like it would be if it were flowing into Beaver Creek or other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| I look, and I believe it would be to the east, and there's a subdivision called Sharon View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2294)|
| 0:38:20| I'm assuming that is an older subdivision, because I do not find what I would call the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2300)|
| 0:38:26| tent or pond in this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| It may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| I'm not familiar with that particular one, but you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| Back circa 1970, those subdivisions didn't have detention requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2313)|
| 0:38:39| How many subdivisions do we have in this immediate drainage area that were built prior to regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2319)|
| 0:38:46| of detention and stormwater?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| I'd have to look a little closer, but there's some older developments out there in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| area that probably do present that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| We could get you those numbers within that watershed if you'd like, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| Commissioner Bussler, this house you speak of with the driveway off of Cherish Grace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2343)|
| 0:39:11| Way, is that 1100 Cherish Grace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| There's 11 and 1101, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| And is there, even on this map at 1111, it appears there's a pond to the side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2360)|
| 0:39:30| Is that structure still there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| That's a water quality pond that does treatment for the water, and then that pond spills into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2373)|
| 0:39:41| the larger pond that serves as the water quality or the water quantity control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2381)|
| 0:39:47| If it's what you're talking about, I think it was a sinkhole there before, and they used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| that off the first two houses that were built, and then we had the economy go down, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2392)|
| 0:39:58| were very large, expensive homes, and finally, when the economy came back, they started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| building these other homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| This whole area is relatively flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| It looks like there's about 20 foot of elevation change over a pretty good distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2408)|
| 0:40:16| I feel for these people, I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| We've had some very unusual circumstances the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| I don't know if it's a trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| Two years makes a trend, but these are some issues that we do need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2426)|
| 0:40:32| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| We do have one additional citizen who is on our public forum, and that's Mr. Greg Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2439)|
| 0:40:54| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| I'm Greg Mills, and I live at 8313 Richland Colony Road, 37923, and I want to talk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2455)|
| 0:41:02| you about this move that you're voting on to the Education Board, to the TVA Towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| tonight, as well as a quick item for those of you that are on the Charter Review Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| Talking about this TVA Tower, what I've seen in the focus, the big thing is public access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2473)|
| 0:41:21| and what I've seen, you're still not there yet, and to protect us taxpayers from buying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| them two headquarters, you need to ask two questions before you vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2486)|
| 0:41:32| The first one is, whoever represents the school board out there, how are the five, six percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2492)|
| 0:41:40| of the citizens, or not citizens, but people who go to school who are illegal aliens supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| to ever go into a federal building for whatever matter they may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| All I've seen is they're not going to ask for a driver's license, but we live in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2511)|
| 0:41:57| 21st century now, and this facial identification stuff is coming, whether you like it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| so I think that's a tough question that you need to ask before you vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2523)|
| 0:42:09| The second is, just get, ask someone from the sheriff's office or whatever if their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2529)|
| 0:42:15| answer makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| And the other thing, so like I said, I don't want the whole deal being done because three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2538)|
| 0:42:25| percent of the people can't get into the building, and then two years from now we've got to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| buy them a new headquarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| Maybe it's better to put the engineering department or plan B or whatever you had in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| So, as far as the, for the Charter Review Commission, the one thing that I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2557)|
| 0:42:43| request, every, you know, it seems like every month somebody comes asking you for money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| various attorney, to settle the question of whether the commission can change text that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2567)|
| 0:42:53| the voters approve, and I think this commission review would be a good time to clean that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| up, and I think the answer should be that, you know, commission can suggest changes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| the voters, but that really the voters need to vote on any changes, because the best example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2584)|
| 0:43:12| would be, you know, we just voted however many years ago to shrink the size of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| and if the power doesn't rest with the voters, then you could, you know, put it back to whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| that number was, 19 or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| So I think that's a, rather than giving all these, you know, various department attorneys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| money to leave it in court and get, you know, an unknown result, that I think it's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| a simple thing you could do on this charter commission to clean that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| Do you mind if I ask a follow-up question specific to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| I mean, just one thing to make sure we're all on the same page, you know, anything that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| that charter commission, you know, comes up with that they want to see changed, just so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| you know, I want to be clear, that all does go to the voters to vote on and to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| Anything that comes out of that charter commission automatically goes into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2635)|
| 0:44:01| I might also say, as a follow-up, you may want to put it, be a little bit more specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2641)|
| 0:44:08| and put it in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| I know that there's a, I know Commissioner Anders is chairing that body, and you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| probably email him, or I believe we've set up a, like a charter review, I know that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| a centralized email that you can send a suggestion to, and if you send it to one email, it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| automatically go out to all of the members who are serving on that, not just the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| but all the citizens at large who are serving on that committee as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| So, and share that with all your friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| Do you know, like, where I look to find that email?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| If you go to the county webpage, we've got a link set on the very, on the landing page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| for Knox County Government that, at the cross the top, it says charter review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| If you click on that, that'll take you into that landing on the front page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| So, otherwise, if you can't find it, just call the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| Like I said, I really, really hope you guys will challenge the school system tonight on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| this access issue before you vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2698)|

| 0:45:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| I looked about them, I guess, when you were first getting set up, and I didn't see much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| So, I thought I'd bring it up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| It's all there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2744)|

| 0:45:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2746)|

| 0:45:48| Thank you, Mr. Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2748)|

| 0:45:50| Is there anyone else who wishes to speak at public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| Moving on our agenda, and before I move on, I do want to thank, I know we have a few special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| folks here tonight that I want to thank for attending the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| Sherry Witt, Arnox County Clerk, thank you for joining us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| Super Bob Thomas, back there, traditionally hanging out in the back right corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| Thank you, Superintendent Thomas, for joining us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| I know Mayor Jacobs was here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| I'm not sure if Mayor Jacobs is still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| He's hiding behind the post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| I can't see you back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| So, thank you for joining us, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| I also saw earlier our Circuit Court Clerk, Charlie Susano, who I love to make fun of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| because we went to elementary school together, and our Elections Administrator, Cliff Rogers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| It's always a pleasure to have you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| I know you've got an item on our agenda tonight, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| I heard from a lot of folks who saw you at the meeting last time that they'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| have you just come out and talk about anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| So, anyhow, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| Is there any other elected officials who are here tonight that I haven't seen or recognized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2808)|
| 0:46:53| I mentioned Sherry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| Yeah, I mentioned Sherry earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| So, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| I think that's got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| So, next, what I'd like to do is set tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2818)|
| 0:47:04| Tonight, just to review, we've got, these are the items that officially need to be voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| on to be added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| Everybody's ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| It's items 45, 46, 47, and 49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2833)|
| 0:47:28| Items 50 and 51 are to be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2848)|
| 0:47:36| Those were 50 and 51.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| I think that's March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| So, 45, 46, 47, 49 are to be officially added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2860)|
| 0:47:46| 50 and 51 are to be deferred to next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| And the non-consent items, if y'all are with me, are items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 47, 48, 49, and 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2868)|
| 0:48:14| Additionally, while we're setting the agenda, we have two discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2894)|
| 0:48:22| My intention is, after the honorary resolution, is to move both of the discussion items to the top of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2902)|
| 0:48:28| We'll work through those first before we get on into the remainder of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| Looking at any other changes, Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| I'll just go ahead and set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| I just want to point of privilege after you set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| I just wanted some clarification on item 49, because last week when we asked for some more clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2925)|
| 0:48:52| it was said it didn't have to do with the schools, which would normally go to the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| but it's the same description item as last week, which says it's about the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| So, before that gets added, I just wanted to see if we could clarify if it's something that's going to go between this body or the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2942)|
| 0:49:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| While I left that on there, when we left out of here, there were some issues about the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| and some of the ones I heard from one person saying that there was water in Gresham School during that flood period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2956)|
| 0:49:26| The roads were getting really bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| Why would we continue on having schools and things like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| But I had talked to Bob Thomas earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| We discussed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| We talked some other issues and what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| So, I've got some information to take back to the people in my district that were concerned about the schools being held during a flooding period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2979)|
| 0:49:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| We'll keep that there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2993)|
| 0:49:54| What we'll do is, Commissioner Jay, your light's still on, or does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=2994)|
| 0:50:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| I know Commissioner Anders has a comment after we've set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| Any additional changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3005)|
| 0:50:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| All in favor, I need a motion to set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| Motion from Commissioner Beeler and a second from Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| All in favor of setting the agenda, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3021)|
| 0:50:22| First item on the agenda is Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| I think Jim Snowden had some follow-up about getting started on the flood discussion with residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3027)|
| 0:50:35| I think he wanted to come down and speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| I think most of the folks left, but we'll still be for record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| Thanks, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| And we certainly want to get this solved as soon as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| There's a little more engineering involved and obviously some right-of-way acquisition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| in most parts prior to construction commencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| So, we'd like to get that started as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| And I spoke with Mr. Caldwell and the administration, and they had had a funding, I guess, option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3056)|
| 0:51:03| that I'll let him speak to that might be able to move that funding ahead a little sooner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| than what we had anticipated at the fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3066)|
| 0:51:11| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| We met a week or so ago, and the mayor directed us to try to resolve the flooding issues as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3074)|
| 0:51:20| quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| One issue that we have, because Jim had submitted some money in his budget request for FY21| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3081)|
| 0:51:30| for flooding remediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| And what we can do is, you all just approved last month refunding of two BABs and another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3093)|
| 0:51:40| bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| We feel like we'll get a premium on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| That goes to market tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| If we get a premium on that, which we expect to, not tomorrow, but next week, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| If we get a premium on that, then we have to bring back to commission how we would fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| how we would spend such a premium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3115)|
| 0:51:59| So, we would come back with an appropriation for the remediation of flood issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3119)|
| 0:52:07| So, you should see something as quickly as next month, which allows Jim and his group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| to start quicker to address those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| I see a couple other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| I think Commissioner Gill was your light on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| Thank you, Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| Would the county have access to any of the FEMA monies because of all of the flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3146)|
| 0:52:32| that occurred here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| And did we get any of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| So, FEMA reimbursement is very strict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3158)|
| 0:52:45| And I think if you don't have flood insurance, it don't qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| Is that not correct, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| And so, it's very strict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3170)|
| 0:52:51| And so, it's not just Manna raining down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| You've got to qualify for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| And there are certain restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| And Dwight can speak to this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| As it relates to getting money, historically, we may get 30 to 40 cents on the dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3180)|
| 0:53:08| for everything that we submit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| So, none of the severe flooding we had, we got no money for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3190)|
| 0:53:15| We've not received word from FEMA yet that there's even anything available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3195)|
| 0:53:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| One thing I would like to add, Commissioner Gill, for these repetitive loss properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| there are grants that we can apply for, but those are competitive across the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| And we're actually in the process of applying for some of those grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| but we won't know for many months prior to whether or not we receive them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| Commissioner Smith, then Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| You know, the problems we've been experiencing have not just been a local issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| it's been a regional as far as east Tennessee and the entire south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| Statistically, 2019 was the wettest February in recorded history for our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3237)|
| 0:54:05| And unfortunately, if we get another half inch of rain between now and the end of the month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3245)|
| 0:54:11| 2020 will be the second wettest February in recorded history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3251)|
| 0:54:16| Oddly enough, if you go back in the top five, there's a period back in 1870, 1870s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3256)|
| 0:54:24| the mid-1871 to 1873, I believe, were the two other heaviest rainfalls in February for our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3264)|
| 0:54:36| This is a problem that it's very unfortunate that people have been affected by it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3276)|
| 0:54:43| but I would like to publicly thank Jim Snowden and EPW for the work they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3283)|
| 0:54:49| They've faced some huge challenges during this time, and they have done wonderful work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| Thank you, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3298)|
| 0:54:59| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| I want to say I'm not fussing at Jim Snowden or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3301)|
| 0:55:06| We work well together on getting these things done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| but people have my phone number, and they call me, and they want answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| and sometimes I try to call you to get answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| and you don't answer your phone at 2.30 or 3 o'clock in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| so I have to wait until you come to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| But you're talking about the wet weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| We've had things in this area that a lot of people don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| We had an instance out on exit 112 on 75 North when Beaver Creek was over the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3328)|
| 0:55:36| and you couldn't get off on Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| In fact, when I was coming home from work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| I had to go all the way north and try to find my way back to my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| So we've had issues on how that water drains out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| and we need, I guess, a little bit more of the study on how we can make that water get out of here quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3350)|
| 0:55:56| So I appreciate all that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| Again, I commend you on what you can do, and I appreciate Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| Chris, I hate to do this in front of everybody, but, Chris, thank you for finding that extra money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| I didn't find any extra money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| We expect to get a premium, and so I think we just utilize that premium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| Well, let me put it this way then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| Thank you for redirecting the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| Thanks to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3381)|
| 0:56:22| It was his idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| Next we have, that's Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| I hate to ask this question because I think you've opened Pandora's box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| You have those four or five really major flooding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| How are you going to choose who gets this funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| I think for us, we'll take Jim's list that he submitted, and they're in order of importance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3402)|
| 0:56:50| and we'll go down that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| When that funding runs out on this premium, then it stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3412)|
| 0:56:57| And so I think what you will see brought before you, assuming there is a premium in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3417)|
| 0:57:03| is going just to be as much as it covers going down to his items of submission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3423)|
| 0:57:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| And, Chris, I'm going to ask a very simple question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| You said a premium, and this is just for all the non-finance folks in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| and some days I'm a good one and some times I'm bad on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| But when you say premium, I know we're getting ready to go to market with this bond issuance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| Is this a case where the demand for Knox County's bond exceeds the supply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3446)|
| 0:57:32| so we're able to ask for a little bit more than the face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| so that we end up netting a bit more money than the originally planned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| If you could, just for the sake of the public and us, because otherwise it seems like magic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| but if you could kind of clarify exactly what happened or what we anticipate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3464)|
| 0:57:49| hopefully, fingers crossed, happening when you say, what does a premium mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| You said it yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| And so people are willing to pay more for our bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| The last time we went to market, we had 17 people that were bidding on our bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| We got a great interest rate and a premium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| I think our interest rate then was 134 or something like 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3484)|
| 0:58:10| And so this will be similar because it's a refunding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| so we'll get hopefully a low interest rate, something below two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| which will save us a lot in interest cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| And we expect to get a premium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| The last premium that we got when we netted out expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| and things was around $3 million, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| Any additional discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| I know that was kind of a foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3518)|
| 0:58:39| We had already set the agenda, and that was a follow-up on Commissioner Anders' question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| So we can now move down into the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| Excuse me, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| I don't know who the school is waiting on back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| but I was going to have all my questions were answered on the flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3530)|
| 0:58:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| So if you need to go home, Superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| We have to consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| We have to have the consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| Well, I mean, so in other words, Charlie, I'm going to ask a clarifying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| One of the items that we have here is a discussion item brought by you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| Are you good to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| I'm good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| So we'll scratch that off, and we will move on to the next item of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| Well, you've got the next item is the honorary resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| To be clear on this one, this is about retiring Judge Susano, Charlie's father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3559)|
| 0:59:25| They are not here tonight because there's a retirement ceremony that's going to be this Friday afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3565)|
| 0:59:30| down at the East Tennessee History Center at 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| What I'd like to ask my fellow commissioners, if we could just pass this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| and then I'm planning on being at that ceremony this Friday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| I encourage everybody to join us if you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| or we'll read that particular resolution to the Susano family at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3583)|
| 0:59:49| Is that agreeable to everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| So we have a motion for approval from Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| It was the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3594)|
| 0:59:55| I think it was Commissioner Anders, if I heard correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| By the way, we do need to read that caption in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| I never read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3599)|
| 1:00:00| I just brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3600)|
| 1:00:01| So, Madam Clerk, would you mind reading the caption into the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3601)|
| 1:00:04| This is a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| honoring Judge Charles D. Susano, Jr., for his 25 years of service in the Tennessee Court of Appeals, Resolution 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3606)|
| 1:00:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| That motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| Next item, as I said, we're jumping straight to the discussion item, which is, I'm going to call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| the Chair recognizes Dr. Martha Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| If you'd like to go ahead and pull that mic down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| We've got a couple of things for you to go over tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| As we mentioned, we've got the official discussion item, which is listed on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| and then we've got the coronavirus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| I know it's got a different name, but you know what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| So, the floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| Martha Buchanan, 140 Damard Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| And if it's okay with the Commission and Commissioner Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| I'd like to speak about the coronavirus first so that I can let Ms. Roland leave if she needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3653)|
| 1:01:00| and not stay for the discussion about injured care, if that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| So, quick update on the coronavirus, and I'll introduce our guest, Ms. Roland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3665)|
| 1:01:10| Coronavirus, there are currently 53 cases in the United States, zero in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3670)|
| 1:01:18| So, if you live in Tennessee, your biggest threat still remains the flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3678)|
| 1:01:22| You'll hear me say that several times during this update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| There are more than 30 countries who have cases of the coronavirus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| That could be one case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3689)|
| 1:01:30| That could be hundreds of cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| Again, most of the cases still continue to be in China.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| So, again, your biggest threat continues to be traveling to China.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| But I will also say that this situation is evolving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| It's evolving rapidly, and if you listen to the news over the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| there are some pop-ups of breakouts, outbreaks in some other countries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3707)|
| 1:01:53| that were kind of unexpected over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| So, we will continue to monitor the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| My staff is looking at the updates every day so that we can have the most recent guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| We have weekly phone calls with the Tennessee Department of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| We check in with them regularly to make sure we're following current CDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| and Tennessee Department of Health guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| The good news is that the CDC has allowed public health department labs across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3732)|
| 1:02:18| to start doing some testing so folks who are at risk can get tested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| and get results a little bit faster, which is nice for them and their families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| because they can go back to work if they're being tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| They will have to be quarantined during that time until we have the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| And it was taking three weeks or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| Being quarantined for three weeks is really no fun at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| and can really impact your pocketbook, so we try not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| We continue to work with the state and, like I said, being on phone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| answering phone calls from physicians, the worried public, hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| anybody and everybody who has a question about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| We're filling those phone calls like we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| My staff is working really hard to, again, stay up to date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| and be able to answer those questions with factual information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| and tamp down some of the fear and concern that is out there that's understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| Confusion about is our products from China safe, is Chinese food safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3785)|
| 1:03:10| and all of those things, answering those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| So, again, in Tennessee, your biggest threat still remains to be the flu,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| so prevent the flu and prevent lots of other illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| Stay home if you're sick like I did last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| Wash your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| Cover your cough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| And get vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| It's not too late to get vaccinated if you haven't been vaccinated against the flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| And, you know, I always have to plug the flu vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| So do you have any questions for me about the medical stuff about coronavirus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3813)|
| 1:03:38| or the public health response to coronavirus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3818)|
| 1:03:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| Well, then I will introduce our next guest, which is Ms. Elizabeth Rowland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| who is the founder and executive director of the Tennessee China Network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| which she began in the fall of 2014 after having worked in government, policy, law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3831)|
| 1:03:56| and business for nearly a decade in both the U.S. and China.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3836)|
| 1:04:00| She has served in Washington, D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| She's worked in China, as I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| She was a policy analyst and editor of the – I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| She worked for the American Chamber of Commerce in China.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| And there she was a policy analyst| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| and editor of the Chamber's American Business in China white paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| As a coordinator and later vice president of AmCham China's policy committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3860)|
| 1:04:25| she also collaborated with the chamber leadership to formulate and execute policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3865)|
| 1:04:31| advocacy priorities, and strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| In 2012, Elizabeth joined the Beijing office of Covington and Burling Law Firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| as a senior manager of policy analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| In addition to tracking and analyzing opportunities and challenges created by Chinese| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3881)|
| 1:04:46| and U.S. investment and trade policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| Elizabeth facilitated client development through the Invest and Invest U.S. Initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| to connect Chinese investors with U.S. companies seeking investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3893)|
| 1:04:58| In 2013, she returned home to Tennessee to be closer to family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| and start a company, so she thought, called Rowland China Advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3902)|
| 1:05:08| In doing her research, she found that there was a need to start a nonprofit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| that would help coordinate information and linkages between China and American business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3911)|
| 1:05:18| And has been doing that since 2014 when she founded the Tennessee China Network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3918)|
| 1:05:23| And she can certainly answer more questions about that than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| Elizabeth received her master's degree in international relations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| with concentrations in international economics and China studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3929)|

| 1:05:45| She is proficient in Mandarin Chinese and fluent in Spanish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| Elizabeth was born and raised in the rolling hills of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3949)|
| 1:05:52| And she's going to talk a little bit more about the impacts of the coronavirus on business and China.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3952)|
| 1:05:59| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| Thank you so much for that introduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| Do I need to state my address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| Sure, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3968)|
| 1:06:09| Sarah Elizabeth Rowland, 615 Balsam Drive in Found City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| So Tennessee China Network is a 501c3 nonprofit organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3974)|
| 1:06:18| Our purpose is to educate and connect people in Tennessee that do business with China| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3978)|
| 1:06:23| with the ultimate goal of boosting exports, attracting Chinese investments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| and creating jobs here in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| We had two events on the coronavirus last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| One here in Knoxville in partnership with the University of Tennessee Asia Engagement Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3993)|
| 1:06:39| and the UTK Asia Studies Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=3999)|
| 1:06:44| And we had, I don't know, probably about 100 people come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| It was a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4007)|
| 1:06:48| And I'm going to share some of the things that I learned at that event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| and at our event that we had in Nashville on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| I'll summarize some of the areas I could talk about in case you have questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| but I'm going to focus on the impact this has on companies here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4020)|
| 1:07:04| If you have questions on the other topics, feel free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| I have some other remarks I could make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4026)|
| 1:07:10| So one is uncertainty around the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19 is what they're calling it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4030)|
| 1:07:17| Two would be the response in China.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4037)|
| 1:07:20| Three would be impacts on the companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4040)|
| 1:07:24| At our event here in Knoxville, we had DeRoyal speak as well as radio systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4044)|
| 1:07:31| so I can share some of the insights they had on how companies can cope with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4051)|
| 1:07:37| And then also some impacts of the crisis on actual people, human beings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4057)|
| 1:07:42| and how this is impacting culturally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| So to dive into the impact on companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4066)|
| 1:07:50| factories were expected to close in China for a month for Chinese New Year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| That happens every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4075)|
| 1:07:56| So we actually got kind of lucky this time that this happened over Chinese New Year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4076)|
| 1:08:03| The impact was blunted a little bit as a result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| Instead of having two or three months down, we only had one or two months down so far with the factories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4086)|
| 1:08:14| The future impact, though, is going to depend on how this virus continues to spread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4094)|
| 1:08:19| or whether it's able to be contained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| A lot of people are asking, you know, if factories in China are shutting down entirely because of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4101)|
| 1:08:26| how is that going to impact prices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| Well, prices tend to be sticky in the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| and in many places there are actually legal restrictions on raising prices in cases of emergencies like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4113)|
| 1:08:41| Companies are not as likely to raise prices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| but they're more likely to potentially have fewer promotionals or sales in the coming months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4125)|
| 1:08:52| particularly in the holiday season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| And this is one of the things that some of our panelists pointed out during our events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| Now is usually the time that companies take orders for their Christmas season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4139)|
| 1:09:05| So this crisis is very likely going to impact what's on the shelves during our shopping season for Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4145)|
| 1:09:13| So buy your Christmas toys now while you still can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4153)|
| 1:09:19| And the impact on businesses varies depending on where they operate or where they have suppliers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4159)|
| 1:09:28| So those companies that have factories or have their suppliers in Wuhan or the Hubei province,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4168)|
| 1:09:35| which is the epicenter of this, are impacted much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4175)|
| 1:09:39| If they're outside of that area, obviously it's less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4179)|
| 1:09:43| In our events that we had last week, some of the presenters gave some specifics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4183)|
| 1:09:50| and I hope I remembered and wrote this down correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| I'll have to go back to the video and find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| But tractor supply in our Nashville event said that they had about 70 percent of their supplier factories were back online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4197)|
| 1:10:07| But Implement Now, a sourcing company, said only 10 percent of theirs were up and running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4207)|
| 1:10:13| KHS America, which is, I believe, a Taiwanese-invested company in Middle Tennessee, spoke at our event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4213)|
| 1:10:19| and they weren't back up online at all as of last Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4219)|
| 1:10:25| And I think Radio Systems said they were about 30 percent online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| So you can see there's a really wide range of how companies are impacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| both our local homegrown companies as well as our Chinese-invested companies here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4233)|
| 1:10:39| To open a factory back up, the requirements vary depending on your location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| So if you're near the epicenter, you might have some more strict requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| One of the requirements is that you have to supply your employees with masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4248)|
| 1:10:53| anywhere from one a day to five a day, that I've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4253)|
| 1:10:57| And masks are sold out across the world right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4257)|
| 1:11:01| So companies are scrambling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| They might legally be allowed to open up if they had masks, but they don't have masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4263)|
| 1:11:09| According to our tractor supply speaker in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4269)|
| 1:11:12| the factories in northern China have fewer migrant workers than other parts of China,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4272)|
| 1:11:17| so they're able to open up more quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| Southern China has a harder time because their migrant workers are coming from far away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4280)|
| 1:11:26| and maybe they got quarantined and stuck when they went home for Chinese New Year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| So you can see there's a lot of complications in getting our businesses back to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4290)|
| 1:11:35| Many companies are seeing delays and problems at the ports as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| Goods are getting quarantined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| Ships are getting quarantined at ports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| And some ships are just skipping ports altogether because they don't want to get quarantined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| So that's making it hard for our companies here to get products and also to export products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4308)|
| 1:11:55| But a good thing to know is that as of now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4315)|
| 1:11:59| it seems that it is not possible to get the disease from products coming from China.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4319)|
| 1:12:04| So don't worry about that T-shirt you're buying at the store that says made in China.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| It's not going to give you coronavirus, according to the medical experts that spoke at our event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4328)|
| 1:12:14| I'm happy to answer other questions on the other topics that I mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4334)|
| 1:12:19| I just want to point out one thing on the cultural piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| In China, it's very common to wear masks every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| When I lived in China, I wore a mask probably 50 percent of the time because of pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| So it's very culturally acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| And I want to make sure that people in Knoxville and Knox County know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| that just because a Chinese person here has on a mask does not mean they have coronavirus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| We have to remember not to treat our Chinese neighbors or our Chinese American neighbors badly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4360)|
| 1:12:46| because they might be wearing a mask or they happen to be Chinese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4366)|
| 1:12:51| Do you all have any questions on any of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| Any extra questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| Great. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| All right. Thank you, Dr. B. Part two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| Part two. So thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| And thank you for letting me move this report to this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4393)|
| 1:13:14| So you all have some handouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| And by the way, the chair wants it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| Sorry, Dr. Buchanan, but I also want to recognize I believe it was Commissioner Carringer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| and Commissioner Gill that brought this particular discussion item to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| So I do want to call on each of them if there's any, if they'd like to introduce you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4407)|
| 1:13:32| So I'm going to call on Commissioner Carringer first on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| Yes. Thank you, Dr. Buchanan, for coming to update us on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4416)|
| 1:13:44| This is something that Commissioner Gill and I were involved in and asked for you to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4424)|
| 1:13:50| when we passed the budget last year because we thought it was really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4430)|
| 1:13:54| and asked for you to do when we passed the budget last year because Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| lowering what they were going to be paying out for the indigent care involving mostly Cherokee health systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4440)|
| 1:14:07| and also we wanted to keep update on that every quarter to see where we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4447)|
| 1:14:13| and to see really all that you've handed out to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4453)|
| 1:14:21| All the numbers going all the way back to 2017 and 2016, from everything I've been able to look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4461)|
| 1:14:29| we're lower numbers from where we've been at from the first quarter, second quarter of all those years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4469)|
| 1:14:38| So that's really interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| I just didn't know if there was any update and all on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4481)|
| 1:14:47| Mainly, I think, and I'll let Commissioner Gill speak for herself and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| is that we wanted to make sure that we're on target with the money that Knox County has put for indigent care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4491)|
| 1:14:59| and to see if anybody is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4499)|
| 1:15:03| The big thing was people thought they were not going to be able to get the health care provided to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4503)|
| 1:15:09| So we wanted to make sure that we are providing the health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4509)|
| 1:15:14| and we wanted to know if anybody is being turned away or not getting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| And Dennis Freeman with Cherokee Health is here and he can answer any specific questions about any changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4519)|
| 1:15:25| they've made to the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4525)|
| 1:15:28| I'm sorry, Commissioner Gill, did you want to add to what Commissioner Freeman said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| I do. I'll just wait until you finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| Okay. Sorry. I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| And so what you have in front of you is the data from Cherokee health systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4537)|
| 1:15:42| which is about visits to their facility and prescriptions written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4542)|
| 1:15:47| They've changed nothing. They've not lowered enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| They've not asked us to lower enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| They haven't changed the number of prescriptions they're providing to the patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| So if patients have the same, there's always been a cap of about seven chronic prescriptions people can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4556)|
| 1:16:03| That's nothing new. That's always been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| That doesn't count the antibiotic you get when you get a sinus infection or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4566)|
| 1:16:10| We don't count those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| And they do other things creatively to make sure folks get the prescriptions they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| and they've continued to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| And as you can see, if you look at those quarters, the numbers kind of go up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4578)|
| 1:16:23| If you look at the different years, the number of visits go up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4583)|
| 1:16:27| And, again, Dr. Freeman can speak to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| If you look at the other data, the colorful graphs that you have and the enrollment data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| what we see is that enrollment started dropping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| We saw it drop in 2017, or 2019, excuse me, before the budget cut was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4598)|
| 1:16:44| We don't have a good explanation for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| Certainly there are some theories behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| Is it our improving economy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| Again, I said last time, to qualify for this program, if you're a single person, you have to make less than $500 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4612)|
| 1:16:59| Any kind of job you're going to have is going to probably pay you more than $500 a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| and just knock you out of qualifying for this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| The dollar amount is based on family size, so it goes up based on your family size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4626)|
| 1:17:13| I've also heard anecdotally from folks who are serving the homeless and others that there's been a shift in people seeking care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4633)|
| 1:17:22| more people not seeking care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| And I'll talk a little bit more about what we're doing to try to, as a community, assess access to care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4644)|
| 1:17:30| because that's what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| It's not about whether the county is going to pay more money to have more people served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4652)|
| 1:17:37| It's about how are we serving the people that need help the best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4657)|
| 1:17:42| with the best coordination of care between Interfaith and Cherokee and Knox Area Project Access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4662)|
| 1:17:48| and what UT is doing and the Free Medical Clinic and all of the other groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4668)|
| 1:17:54| excuse me, that are focusing on serving people who don't have insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4674)|
| 1:17:57| So Dr. Gray is going to talk a little bit about what UT is doing specifically in a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4677)|
| 1:18:03| but to let you know, I'm convening a work group of all those organizations to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4683)|
| 1:18:09| Assessing access to care is a real challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| Access to care has many facets to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| Money is one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| Transportation is another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4696)|
| 1:18:17| Geography is another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4697)|
| 1:18:18| Culture is another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| So there are all these things that we have to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| And how do we best serve these people using the resources that we have in our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| Because we have a lot of resources to bring to bear that aren't just county government resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4706)|
| 1:18:31| So that's my goal, and I feel like that's my charge from the county mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4711)|
| 1:18:35| to better bring the resources we have in our community together to coordinate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4715)|
| 1:18:39| and collaborate to best serve our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| And that's our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| And so we look at these numbers, and, yes, they've changed, but they've kind of been changing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| and they've been changing over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| And people are not being turned away from getting procedures that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| Referrals have always been hard in this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| If you don't get paid what you bill for services, you kind of limit how many you do when you're in a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4740)|
| 1:19:06| Doctors are in a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4746)|
| 1:19:07| They have to pay the light bill, and their staff, and themselves, and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| So we haven't had any reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| And if you all hear of anybody who's on this program who can't get their needs met, we want to know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4753)|
| 1:19:21| And it's hard to also see the folks who aren't being served because they're not here to count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4761)|
| 1:19:27| So one of the things we hope to be able to do is maybe leverage some partnerships that we have with the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4767)|
| 1:19:35| to help us assess access and, you know, what is really the need in the community for access to care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4775)|
| 1:19:42| and then create a program that's going to meet that need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| You know, where's the gap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| So, I mean, I think the numbers sort of speak for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4786)|
| 1:19:49| They've been trending down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4789)|
| 1:19:50| I don't, you know, they're lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| Some are higher than last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| Some are lower than last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| Again, we'll just have to kind of keep looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| If you guys have any specific questions about the data, I'm happy to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| If you have any specific questions for Dr. Freeman, he's here to answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4805)|
| 1:20:13| Commissioner, I think I'm saying Commissioner Biggs, then Gil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4813)|
| 1:20:17| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4817)|
| 1:20:18| Thank you, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4818)|
| 1:20:19| I just had a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| Does climate ever play a role in your data, like if it's colder or things of that nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4821)|
| 1:20:26| I think over – we haven't looked at the data to trend it out based on seasonal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4826)|
| 1:20:33| Dr. Freeman might be able to answer the question if their enrollment is seasonal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4833)|
| 1:20:37| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| Do you see a seasonal change in your –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| Not much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4841)|
| 1:20:42| You know, we have people who walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4844)|
| 1:20:45| With you in mind, if you're going to respond, please approach the podium and state for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| for our friends at the clerk's office, state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| Yeah, Dennis Freeman, 935, Ethan Sklen, zip 37, 923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4852)|
| 1:21:00| We have some people who walk to our offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| So when weather – inclement weather is there, we – some days, we're going to have fewer people come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4864)|
| 1:21:13| But generally, overall, pretty consistent throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4873)|
| 1:21:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| Next, Commissioner Gill, and then Smith, then back to Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4880)|
| 1:21:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4884)|
| 1:21:25| And I appreciate the work of the information that was presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| but it's difficult to look at the real data of this when it was just given today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| But I think the really important issues are the conversations we need to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4896)|
| 1:21:41| One that you touched upon is the health disparities, and that's what I would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| I mean, this conversation is about the health disparities in a system of care that is not contiguous here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4906)|
| 1:21:54| And whether it's emotional, financial, structural, or cultural, I'd like to see some information that impacts this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4914)|
| 1:22:02| I appreciate the historic perspective from 2016 through 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4922)|
| 1:22:09| but I'd like to look at what are the barriers preventing people from accessing primary care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| and our continuum of services in terms of how we can fill the gaps of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4934)|
| 1:22:21| And I appreciate these emergency department visits, but they don't look at overlap in terms of more than one illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4941)|
| 1:22:30| your mental health as well as your physical health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| These are just specific issues associated with diagnosis by codes of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4953)|
| 1:22:39| This is what the top ten issues we're treating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| So most of this is really still just incomplete when you look at the totality of services we're trying to provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4962)|
| 1:22:51| vulnerable populations of people in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4971)|
| 1:22:57| As you know, you've all been invited to lunch on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| You had communication from our director of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| and we intend to get more into the specifics of how this program really works for your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4983)|
| 1:23:11| Any questions like that specifically, we can certainly provide that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4991)|
| 1:23:16| Look forward to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4996)|
| 1:23:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4997)|
| 1:23:18| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=4999)|
| 1:23:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5000)|
| 1:23:21| Back to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5001)|
| 1:23:22| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| Looking at these first and second quarter enrollments, 19 to 20 is up slightly for both first and second quarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5003)|
| 1:23:32| Is there a quarter in which enrollments come in heavy, or is it pretty much even throughout the four quarters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5012)|
| 1:23:42| It's generally pretty even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| You know, like I said before, during inclement weather, if we have a hard winter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5024)|
| 1:23:50| you know, if people are coming to us on foot, you know, there's going to be some lower some months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5030)|
| 1:23:56| Summers tend to be a little bit lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| You know, falls and springs tend to be a little bit higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| That's probably the case throughout the health care system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5041)|
| 1:24:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5044)|
| 1:24:05| And this enrollment number, is this new enrollees in that quarter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| or is that the number of people enrolled in the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| These are the number of people who received service, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| So are you looking at page 104?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5060)|
| 1:24:21| Those are the people who are currently actively enrolled in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5064)|
| 1:24:25| Is that for each quarter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| It was 445 for the first quarter and 413 for the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| That wasn't 413 additional enrollees in the second quarter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5075)|
| 1:24:36| If I look at the first six months, you know, the number of people that have received a service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5076)|
| 1:24:44| I think it's a little over 500, so we're really on a pace to have more people receiving care this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5084)|
| 1:24:52| probably than we did in previous years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| We haven't changed anything at all about the enrollment procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5094)|
| 1:24:58| You know, our mission is to see all the uninsured, you know, and that's a pretty big task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5098)|
| 1:25:05| I mean, we appreciate your partnership with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5105)|
| 1:25:10| We saw 71,000 unduplicated patients last year, and 30% of them throughout our system were enrolled, were uninsured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5110)|
| 1:25:19| You know, so that's a huge number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| We've got some data that we'll show on Wednesday that shows the numbers just for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5121)|
| 1:25:26| Actually, by your districts, the best we can figure out, you know, where they really come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5126)|
| 1:25:36| And that's what we want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5136)|
| 1:25:38| The uniqueness about this program is that it's a continuum of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5138)|
| 1:25:45| So there's funding to provide referrals to specialists, to hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5145)|
| 1:25:51| Many of our funding sources just pay for primary care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5151)|
| 1:25:56| So that's a challenge for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| And if we look at the cost of this program, year-to-date, about 49% of it is pharmacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5158)|
| 1:26:05| And we're subsidizing this program with other sources of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5165)|
| 1:26:10| So as we go into next year, we'll have to take a hard look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5170)|
| 1:26:14| and we'll work with Dr. Buchanan and others to see what modifications we can make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5174)|
| 1:26:21| We've got to live within the dollars that we receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| Thank you for all you're doing, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5184)|
| 1:26:25| It's really appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5187)|
| 1:26:28| Commissioner Carringer, and then back to Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5188)|
| 1:26:31| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| Yes, I'd like to hear from Dr. Gray sitting back there from University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5193)|
| 1:26:40| because the University of Tennessee has really taken on the free medical clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5200)|
| 1:26:46| which some of you all may not know that Dr. Kim had and retired from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5206)|
| 1:26:51| So University of Tennessee Medical Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| I was quite proud of them that they stepped up to take on this new thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5214)|
| 1:27:01| And also Cherokee is very vital to Knox County, and they have their own pharmacy and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5221)|
| 1:27:10| and they do get directly into Cherokee from the University of Tennessee, the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5230)|
| 1:27:19| when they're dismissed and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5239)|
| 1:27:22| So, Dr. Gray, it's an honor to have you here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5242)|
| 1:27:26| and I'd love to hear what you want to do, update us on all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| So, for the record, Keith Gray, 11761 Couch Mill Road, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5250)|
| 1:27:36| Thank you, Commissioner Carringer, for that segue and introduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5256)|
| 1:27:39| If you will allow me 20 seconds to kind of go from 20,000 feet to what we're doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5259)|
| 1:27:44| So across the country, as you know, we spend a lot of money on health care, $3 trillion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| which is a large percentage of our GDP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| For any person in this room, we're going to spend $10,000 per person this year on just health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5270)|
| 1:27:55| So, said another way, we do sick care very well in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5275)|
| 1:27:59| However, we spend more money than anybody in the world, probably by two factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5279)|
| 1:28:04| Our outcomes are dismal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| And as you know that from the state of health in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| we rank in the bottom 10 states as far as health outcomes, no matter what you measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| And I won't get into the details of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| But Knox County, on the other hand, from an optimistic standpoint, looks very different than Tennessee at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5297)|
| 1:28:23| Of the 95 counties, we rank number 17 overall in health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| And we probably look very similar to metropolitan health in anywhere you would look in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5307)|
| 1:28:33| So what am I saying by that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| I think we have a solvable health care problem in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5315)|
| 1:28:39| We have 400, and you guys know better than I do, 60,000 residents or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5319)|
| 1:28:43| And if we look at the at-risk areas in Knox County, it looks very similar to that piece of art you have on the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5323)|
| 1:28:48| If we look at those red areas, those high-risk areas, they are few in number compared to the overall ZIP codes we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5328)|
| 1:28:55| And that total population at risk, Commissioner Gill, is about 175,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5335)|
| 1:29:00| But when we drill down on that number, and not all 175,000 are at risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5340)|
| 1:29:04| but when we drill down on that number, we start to identify those disparities that you alluded to earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5344)|
| 1:29:10| And they exist along the lines of poverty slash income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5350)|
| 1:29:15| They exist along the lines of education, and they exist along the lines of access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5355)|
| 1:29:21| Now, any of those are surrogates for outcomes of health care across the country, but especially in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5361)|
| 1:29:27| So it's pretty hard to solve the educational problem and poverty problem overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5367)|
| 1:29:31| But we can start working on the access problem pretty immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| And as the academic medical center in the community, we thought we should be involved in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5374)|
| 1:29:41| You know, heretofore, we haven't been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| We've been doing sick care, but we want to be involved in the community in improving access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5383)|
| 1:29:48| And so, as you alluded to, Dr. Kim retired November 1st of last year from the free medical clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5388)|
| 1:29:54| That clinic had been in existence for 27 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| Twelve of those years, he practiced medical oncology and saw patients after hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| Since 2005, he saw patients exclusively that were working uninsured, saw over 16,000 patients in that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5401)|
| 1:30:09| And so he came to us a year ago and said, I'm ready to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| Would the University of Tennessee Medical Center be interested in continuing to keep that initiative going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5412)|
| 1:30:18| So just to be clear, and for the record, the free medical clinic is still in existence, is still an independent 501C3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5418)|
| 1:30:24| but the University of Tennessee Medical Center is providing grant funding to keep that open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| We are providing the medical staff to keep it open and grant funding should there be a shortfall in operations for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5428)|
| 1:30:35| That clinic has been reopened since the 16th of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| We're seeing about 15 patients a day, which is a little bit more than what's being seen in that space before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5438)|
| 1:30:43| And we're annualized, planning to see about 4,000, 4,500 patients this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5443)|
| 1:30:48| Going to Dr. Buchanan's comment and Dr. Freeman's comment about, you know, what percentage of the uninsured that represents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5448)|
| 1:30:55| I think there are about 40,000 uninsured in this county annually, give or take a few thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5455)|
| 1:30:59| Cherokee is seeing the bulk of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| We want to come in and link arms with them to help continue to see more of those, along with Interfaith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5461)|
| 1:31:07| and along with the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| We also have another initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| You've heard about the Haslam-Sansom Complex in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| Within that complex is a clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5474)|
| 1:31:16| That is a partnership with Cherokee Health Systems to provide health care, what we call health and community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5476)|
| 1:31:25| so that the constituents of Lonsdale don't have to leave Lonsdale to get their health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5485)|
| 1:31:30| They can get it right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5490)|
| 1:31:31| And so some of those folks that used to be seen outside of Lonsdale are now seeking their health care within that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5491)|
| 1:31:37| So, again, going back, Commissioner Gill, to your questions, we're trying to address the access issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5497)|
| 1:31:42| But are there bigger issues that contribute to disparities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5504)|
| 1:31:45| And they go beyond health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| They speak to housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5508)|
| 1:31:49| They speak to education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| They speak to green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5511)|
| 1:31:52| And that takes a partnership between all sectors in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5512)|
| 1:31:56| So I'll stop there, and I'll answer any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5516)|
| 1:31:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5519)|
| 1:32:00| Thank you, Dr. Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5520)|
| 1:32:01| And Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5523)|
| 1:32:04| Thank you for joining us here, Dr. Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| I'm thrilled that the University of Tennessee is really taking a lead role and stepping up in some of those clinics that are vital to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5527)|
| 1:32:14| and also helping bring together another layer of cooperation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5534)|
| 1:32:18| Dr. Buchanan, there you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| Sorry, I didn't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| As we enter the next budget season, I'm assuming, based on the previous work you've done through the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5542)|
| 1:32:30| that you're compiling information data, talking to all the partners, and essentially bringing to the table, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5550)|
| 1:32:37| a year ago here's where we were, here's where we are today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| and I look forward that might provide more information to both our mayor and to us about funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5560)|
| 1:32:46| and opportunities to help the program move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5566)|
| 1:32:50| Would that be accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| That is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| I think, for me, it's trying to figure out where this program fits into all of the other programs that are in existence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5573)|
| 1:33:01| because there are many programs to serve the many uninsured in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5581)|
| 1:33:06| and we need to bring them together, and each will play their role in what that looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5586)|
| 1:33:12| and how that works with the partnerships with UT and others who are interfaith is a very important piece to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5592)|
| 1:33:20| So, yeah, we'll be able to present that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| You know, some of the data Commissioner Gill talks about, we certainly have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5603)|
| 1:33:28| This was kind of intended to be very specific to a program that was cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5608)|
| 1:33:32| so that's why we're bringing this data to you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| But, yeah, if there are things you would like to see, we can certainly look at those and be able to bring them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5615)|
| 1:33:42| What we can see from the data about people being seen is that Cherokee, the outpatient provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5622)|
| 1:33:48| hasn't changed what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5628)|
| 1:33:51| We don't see people not getting, we're not told by Cherokee or others that people are not getting the services that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5631)|
| 1:33:57| That doesn't mean the access problem is solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| It's definitely not solved, and it's not perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| But we continue to work with partners to solve that problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5642)|
| 1:34:07| and bring all the forces that we have to bear to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5647)|
| 1:34:11| Thank you for bringing everybody together tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=5654)|

| 1:53:02| the research, that other metropolitan areas in the state of Tennessee do provide for special judge pay, so that is why we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=6782)|
| 1:53:08| presented this ordinance and would very much appreciate the Commission's support. I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=6788)|
| 1:53:17| I don't think there's any questions on this. This is a great call, Ms. Roberts. We appreciate the bar bringing this to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=6797)|
| 1:53:26| This is the first reading, and it takes two readings to pass, so it will be official next month. Yes, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=6806)|
| 1:53:32| Thank you. My question is, do we have a list of judges that will be in line or the process by which we would have to tap a judge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=6812)|
| 1:53:42| Just help me walk through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=6822)|
| 1:53:47| Certainly. Sorry, Madam Commissioner. Sorry to say, Your Honor. That's what I get for having five General Sessions bosses, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=6827)|
| 1:53:53| Someone must have served on the bench prior in order to qualify as a special judge. This is different than a substitute magistrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=6833)|
| 1:54:01| So we do have a couple of former judges who are willing to serve, including this one who did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=6841)|
| 1:54:09| And if I may also make a comment of our gratitude, mine individually, but certainly the General Sessions judges who are at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=6849)|
| 1:54:17| conference right now, which is why they can't be here, to the law director and his staff. They were very helpful in the research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=6857)|
| 1:54:25| underlying this and also in formalizing the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=6865)|
| 1:54:30| I want to publicly acknowledge them. Any other questions, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=6870)|
| 1:54:35| Well, the motion is properly before us. All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=6875)|
| 1:54:40| Mr. Chairman, do we not have to do a roll call since this is an ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=6880)|
| 1:54:45| Mr. Law Director, do we need to do this as a roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=6885)|
| 1:54:50| All right. Thank you for that clarification. Madam Clerk, we'll go ahead and do a roll call vote on this if you're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224business?start=6890)|
