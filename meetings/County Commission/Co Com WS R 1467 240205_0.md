| 0:00:00| Thanks for watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=0)|
| 0:00:30| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=30)|
| 0:00:34| It's 2 o'clock. I'm calling to order this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=34)|
| 0:00:38| regarding our growth plan. And this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=38)|
| 0:00:42| is for our growth plan only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=42)|
| 0:00:46| This is for the purpose of education and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=46)|
| 0:00:50| processing the outcome of NOx planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=50)|
| 0:00:54| Again, just the growth plan. There will be no public form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=54)|
| 0:00:58| at this meeting. However, we welcome the fact that citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=58)|
| 0:01:02| and press are here alike. The format| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=62)|
| 0:01:06| that we're going to use on this is we're going to be hearing from the Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=66)|
| 0:01:10| from Jim Snowden, from Amy Brooks, and perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=70)|
| 0:01:14| a couple of other folks. If you all would please hold your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=74)|
| 0:01:18| questions until all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=78)|
| 0:01:22| presenters have finished. I'm anticipating many of our questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=82)|
| 0:01:26| will be answered after we hear them. And then after that, I'll open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=86)|
| 0:01:30| the floor to take our own questions. Commissioners, please be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=90)|
| 0:01:34| sure, too, that you have the back of your microphones plugged in so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=94)|
| 0:01:38| we're ready to go. And having said that, Mr. Mayor, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=98)|
| 0:01:42| going to open the meeting with your remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=102)|
| 0:01:56| You're not a good listener.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=116)|
| 0:02:26| It takes a second to cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=146)|
| 0:02:42| Okay, I think there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| Thank you for your patience. Thank you, Madam Chair and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| Commissioners. Thank you all for taking the time to be here today and to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| more about the growth policy plan and amendments. As you're aware, the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| policy process is somewhat complicated. A little history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| of how we got here. After an attempt to amend the plan in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| we listened to feedback and began the process of creating our first comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=186)|
| 0:03:10| land use and transportation plan. Reconvening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| the Growth Policy Committee was the next step. I proposed an amendment based on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| data gathered from the comprehensive plan, as well as input from the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| and various stakeholders. The committee reconvened in October of last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| and held its final meeting in January. In all, there were four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| public meetings at which many of you were in attendance. We heard from residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| as well as members of this body requesting additional changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=214)|
| 0:03:38| to the proposal. We carefully considered each request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=218)|
| 0:03:42| made some edits, and presented a final amendment, which was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| at the Growth Policy Coordinating Committee meeting on January 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| There are members from the leadership team here to give a presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| and answer any questions you might have regarding the plan and the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| I realize that land use decisions are always contentious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| and that no plan is going to be perfect. Nevertheless, I'm convinced that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| our proposal does provide the best option for the continued well-being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| of Knox County and our people. I ask for your support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| and help in moving this plan forward. And as always, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| for your service in Knox County. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| Thank you. Mr. Stoden, I believe you're next to be speaking to the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| Actually, Ms. Brooks will take that and then I will follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| Certainly. Certainly. Good afternoon, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| We want to start out by talking to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| about the relationship of all these different plans that we have here in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| So we want to start off by talking about the growth policy plan and what it does and doesn't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| And put it into context with the other tools that we as an agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| in Knox County have to consider land use and future growth and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| So I'm going to talk about where we are right now and the purpose of this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| which is the growth policy plan. This is one of the three documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| that we'll touch on here briefly at the beginning of the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| And I'm going to talk about the purpose of the plan, which is to establish three areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| The urban growth, the planned growth, and the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=310)|
| 0:05:14| Of all the documents that I'll go over, this one is the most general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| And reading this map does not tell us that everything shown in yellow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| is going to be suburban residential neighborhoods, but that every parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=322)|
| 0:05:26| in the rural area is a farm. What it does tell us is that the areas in yellow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| have been identified as places that future growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=330)|
| 0:05:38| I want to take a minute to emphasize some things that this plan does not do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| It is not a rezoning of someone's property. It does not dictate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| development. But like I said just a moment ago, it does identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| places that future growth could go in the years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| It doesn't make someone use their property differently or make them sell their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| If someone is farming on their property right now, this process does not change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| So now I want to touch on the comprehensive plan. The purpose of this plan is to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| recommendations for land use and transportation. It outlines policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| and guidance on how the county can guide future growth. The creation of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| plan is really how we got started with all this, as the mayor mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| The advanced NOx process has taken place over the last two plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| years and involved a thorough analysis of where and how the county could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| accommodate growth. And we've received input from thousands of community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| through this process. This helps us go from the general question of where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| could growth be accommodated that we are answering through the growth policy plan to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| types of uses are appropriate in these different areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| This is the point where we can begin to understand where and what scale residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| development might occur or where a commercial center might be more appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| And it's important to note that there are places with rural character found throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=414)|
| 0:06:58| our county. Again, when you look at this map, you're able to see much more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| nuance and can identify what places, even those within the planned growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| area, that are anticipated to remain more rural in character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| and which areas are more appropriate for that traditional suburban style development and where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| we might see more intense uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| Those are the things you can't determine by looking at the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| policy plan map, but can begin to understand with a comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| I just want to emphasize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| that the comprehensive plan map, which we refer to as the future land use map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| or FLUME, was created first with all the input that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| mentioned over the last two years. And we then began, we took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| those growth policy boundaries and brought them into alignment with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| And finally, we have our zoning ordinance and map. This document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| takes the recommendations from the comprehensive plan and defines what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| legally allowed at the parcel level. It is the most detailed, defined tool that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| But I want to be clear that we are talking about right now is not the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| code. We in the county know that this document will have to be updated to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| help us implement the comprehensive plan if it's adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| We know that both the separation and coordination among these three documents can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| confusing, but it's really important to note that they are all closely linked and build upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| each other. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to my colleague, Director Snowden, who's going to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| the proposed amendments to the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| And before you do, Amy, if you would just in one sentence, please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| define the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| and the next one and the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| Just a one sentence definition so that everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| up here understands the language we're speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| So the growth policy plan establishes boundaries for rural plan growth and urban growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| areas. And you want me to define the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| Comprehensive plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| The comprehensive plan provides recommendations for land use and transportation policies and action steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| to guide future growth and economic prosperity and quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| And these recommendations in the comprehensive plan are presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| by planning to commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| They will be, in terms of the draft comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| that we've been working on with the county, it will be presented by the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| and planning staff. All right. Thank you. And then that ends with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| the zoning. The zoning regulates land uses recommended in the comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| by defining what is legally allowed on a specific parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| Thank you. Thank you. All right. Mr. Snowden. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| I will go through the text amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| as well as the amendments to the map that were approved by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| the growth policy committee that you all will be considering later this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| month. Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| The first text amendment is really just adding some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| specificity to the rezonings on slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| In the current plan that was adopted in 2000, it only identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| certain zones that those slope requirements were to be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=610)|
| 0:10:14| This plan indicates that rezonings of slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| shall be placed on the adopted policies of each body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| So that's a little more specific than the previous plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| Next slide, please. Once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| a little bit more specifics there on this one. You have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| three handouts in your packet there that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| denote rural crossroads, rural conservation, and rural living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| Those are the only place types that will be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| for any staff's consideration as part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| the new growth policy plan. Previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| it did allow ag, estate, open space, floodway, and PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| So once again, a little more specifics there. Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| A lot of words here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| This is something that we revised in the previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| growth policy plan to allow for additional restrictions in the rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| area to allow for the better alignment of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| growth and infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| I won't read it verbatim, but essentially it talks to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| in the current growth policy plan, you can have up to three dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| an acre in the rural area. In this proposal, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| only allowed two dwelling units per acre. Within that two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| dwelling units an acre, you are required to have a sanitary sewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| system or a private system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| approved by the public utility that would ultimately maintain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| And then there is language in this one regarding the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| width of the road that you would join. The old plan did not codify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| This one speaks to that you must have a collector roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| as defined by the major road plan of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| that's adopted by this body of 18 feet or greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| in width. So those are some additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| things that we wanted to add in to allow for the protection of those rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| areas. Next slide please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=738)|
| 0:12:26| This particular issue, it talks about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| it's the effective date of this plan. All previously approved densities in rural areas shall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| remain in effect. Essentially what's that saying is you are grandfathered in and zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| If you have a PR zone at three dwelling units an acre and you're in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| current or the proposed rural area, you will retain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| that three dwelling units an acre and not go back to the two that we just previously talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| Next slide please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| That's the summary of the text amendments. Now we'll talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| a little bit about the map amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| In this particular map is the total of the expanded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| areas. We had a total of five areas that we expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| The percentage of plan growth expansion was 7%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| So from the 2000 map to the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| that you're looking at today, that is a 7% increase in area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| of PGA expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| We'll talk about three of the large areas that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| expanded. There were two small areas that were so minor that we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| have a particular slide for. We can get you that information. Those were at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| Straw Plains and then at Oak Ridge Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| in the Carnes community, but they were very small. These three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| particular expansions, one is on Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| near the Bower Field community. Obviously Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| is a major state highway that is undergoing substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| improvements right now. So in addition to that, there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| some utility infrastructure in place. So this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| map reflects the expansion of the roadway and the sewer and water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| infrastructure to align those growth policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| Next slide please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| This shows the expansion in the Hardin Valley community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| If you'll notice, it runs parallel with Hardin Valley Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| and then goes off of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| buffers off of that. It doesn't go much down to the lake where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| those infrastructures are not adequate, both from sewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| and water and roadways, but it does stay parallel to that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| We have several projects that are in place here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| Expansion of Everett Road, we are working on getting a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| design contract for the expansion of Hardin Valley Road. So once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| just trying to align that transportation infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| with the expansion of the PGA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| The last area is in the Rita community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| As you can see, we expanded up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| almost McGinnis Road, kind of starting a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| past Burkhart to McGinnis. This area of expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| obviously there's several road projects, one in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| a couple in the county, that we're going to use to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| this. We actually have a request for qualifications that we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| to do to bring on a sub-consultant to do much like we did the Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| Transportation Study a few years ago. We're going to do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| Gibbs Transportation Study. Unfortunately, in Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| we did it after a lot of growth occurred. We're going to do this one before that growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| does occur so that we can be proactive in that and ultimately assign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| projects that would serve this community and this growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| in the next 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| Next steps, the growth policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| amendments have to be approved by all three legislative bodies in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| The county commission, this body, will consider these on February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| the 26th. We do have meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| scheduled with city council on March the 5th and one on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| March the 28th with the Town of Farragut Board of Aldermen. So it is our hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| to have the plan and text amendments approved by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| end of March. And last slide is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| just how the, to Amy, when she spoke about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| the flume, the future land use map, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| process, we did have a meeting with the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| last week. It was originally on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| for February. We received some comments. We wanted to digest those a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| So we did defer 30 days. So the flume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| will be considered by planning commission in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| We will then obviously need to meet with you guys and go over the specifics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| and any questions you may have. And then we hope to have the future land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| use map for your all's bodies for consideration in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| April. So with that, I'd be happy to entertain any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| questions or comments you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| Is there anyone else that's going to be speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| directly to this before I open the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1042)|
| 0:17:30| Ms. Brooks? No? All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| All right. That was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| a really excellent concise summary of exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| what we're dealing with at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| point in time. Having said that, I will go ahead and open the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| floor to questions and comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| Ms. Frazier? Thank you, Madam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| Chair. First, I want to thank this administration and the leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| team. You all have really put in the work. I mean, I've seen a genuine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| commitment to the process and approving our approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| to land use and decision making and also planning for supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| infrastructure. So thank you for that. You know, over the course of the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| of the last two years, I have been in constant communication with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| leadership members, my policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| advisor, advocacy groups, and community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| And I know this has not been an easy undertaking at all, especially when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| the priority outcomes of all the data and collection and public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| was, one, preservation and conservation of our rural character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| and hillside and ridgetops, two, coordinating infrastructure with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1122)|
| 0:18:46| development, and three, more housing options. So finding balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| between those, it's a tremendous challenge. And I know you all have worked really hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| to do that. So thank you. I also want to thank the thousands of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| citizens who came out for the Advanced NOx meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| And they continue to be a part of this very important process. I think it's important to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| remind everyone that we work for you. And we know that your land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| is your most valuable asset. And as a county, we've got to treat it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| So of course, we want to be welcoming to newcomers. But our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| focus really does need to be on the half a million citizens who've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| paid into our tax base and have felt the squeeze of unintentional growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| I want to make sure we do that. And I'm committing to ensuring that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| our land use processes that we put into place strengthen and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| elevate our standards. We've got a lot of work to do, but it does start with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| this growth policy plan. So with all that said, I do have a series of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| questions about the process. And several of my questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| do relate to the Comprehensive Plan and the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| Unified Development Ordinance. Those are all critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| pieces of the bigger picture. So it's hard to discuss one without mentioning or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| asking questions about the other. Also, I'm hoping that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| will have a similar workshop on the Comprehensive Plan like you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| all presented to Planning Commission. I attended that and it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| really well done and super informative. So well done on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| and thank you for that. I'll try not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| get into the weeds too much, but that's kind of where I'm most comfortable, which my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| are, I think, learning. So I do ask you to bear with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| and your patience as I kind of work through these questions. And some of them are quite elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| but I really want the public to have a good understanding of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| steps in the process and how and where we will address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| many of the questions and concerns that they put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| Starting with that, if you'll just briefly give us the state legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| regarding land use and kind of how the growth policy plan was created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| start now. I would welcome others to jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| So Public Tector 1101, it's called the Growth Policy Act. It requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| a comprehensive growth policy plan in each county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| in the state and outlines anticipated development for areas over a 20-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| period. Thank you, Amy. Now, will you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| just summarize quickly each body's scope of authority for the growth policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| plan? And I mean the Coordinating Committee, County Commission, the Town of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| Farragut, and the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1282)|
| 0:21:30| So the Coordinating Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| I'm going to step back a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| So the Knox County Growth Policy Coordinating Committee was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| originally formed in 1998 in response to this legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| Public Chapter 1101, to prepare that local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| growth plan for Knoxville and Knox County, Town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| The plan was adopted in 2001, and pages 1 through 5 of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| current growth policy plan outline, provide background on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| how that plan was developed. The charter itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| addresses zoning, but I think that was another question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| that you had, but it doesn't specifically speak to this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| So once the Coordinating Committee reviews an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| amendment, it goes to this body, as was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| laid out in sort of these steps here, but also City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| Knoxville City Council, as well as the Town of Farragut, as well, have to vote on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| amendment. Thank you for going over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| And you talked a little bit about the difference between the growth map and the future land use map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| Can you just clarify that which of those will be a policy map or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| codified and which will not? And if one is not, is there the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| to codify that map as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| If you could maybe specify what you mean by codified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| Well, the growth map is a policy map, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| as it stands now, the future land use map is advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| So if the County Commission adopts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| either plan, it becomes operative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| So it means that future decisions regarding land use must comply with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| those plans. So you're saying that the FLUME will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| have a scope of authority? If it's adopted by County Commission, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| And I don't know if your attorney would like to weigh in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| Absolutely. Thank you. Can you go over kind of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| criteria that was used to determine the proposed amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| of the growth map? Like, for instance, did you look at the availability of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| sewer and environmental constraints? What other factors were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| considered? Farmland, soil?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| And just kind of talk about how you were able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| designate the planned growth areas, rural areas, and urban areas, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| I'll jump in a little bit there, Commissioner Frazier. I kind of spoke a little bit of that, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| probably it was remiss. I should have got a little more into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| We had several committees as part of this. Some of those obviously were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| schools and utilities. So we wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| align the capacity of schools, capacity of roadway infrastructure, as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| capacity of utilities to locations that didn't put a burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| on those entities. So we actually went back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| revisited that with the utility providers really within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| last month just to verify that. So from an infrastructure perspective, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| what I guess was my role in the selection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| of those areas. Yeah. Just to add a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| more context, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| whole process started with Advanced Knox. And I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| all of you remember we've sat down and spoken to you several times about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| Advanced Knox process. One of the things that we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| through that Advanced Knox process was do scenario planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| The scenario planning looked at the underlying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| characteristics of the places within Knox County and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| determined how much capacity they could hold and whether they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| suitable for basically would development want to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| and site itself in those locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| And once we had done all of that, we kind of backfilled the areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| of the growth policy boundaries. So once we'd looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| at a very comprehensive analysis of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| where growth could occur in the entire county, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| then drew around the borders of place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| types which were suitable for a planned growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| location versus a rural location. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| when you think about how these growth policy boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| were determined, they built upon the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| that we did in the comprehensive plan. So it wasn't a separate process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| This is basically a product of that larger two-year process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| where we spoke to people, had our subcommittees, spoke to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| the Technical Advisory Committee, the Public Advisory Committee, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| this is the result of that. Thank you, Kathy. And excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| for the record, would you identify yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| Kathryn Olson, Engineering and Public Works. Thank you, Kathryn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| And then how and where will we connect adding more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| land to the planned growth area to more affordable housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| I think it's important for the public to understand that decision makers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| we can't consider price points during our deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| So what legislative policies can the county put into place that will ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| more housing options in the planned growth area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1602)|
| 0:26:54| None of our current policies or these plans can determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| the affordability of a specific development. That's not something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| that's within our purview. There could be policies and programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| that are put into place by the local jurisdiction that could incentivize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| affordability, but that's not something that we control with the plans that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| have currently. Is that something that we can look at through the place types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| and also our Unified Development Ordinance as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| some of the standards and requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| I don't think you could utilize place types to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| affordability. Again, that is a land use tool. There are some, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| think even in your zoning code you could put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| policies into place in that particular ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| that would require something to be of a certain level of affordability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| or to prevent something to be a certain level of affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| There are other tools in place that could be explored by the county over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| the next several years, but I wouldn't say that's something that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| would want to use one of these tools for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| And then there were some questions from citizens and advocacy groups about the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| projections that were used. Do you all care to just speak to that really quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1684)|
| 0:28:12| Teri Kahula is with our research staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1692)|
| 0:28:20| So with the comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| plan portion of this work, the population projections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| were derived from the 2045 mobility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| plan, which is the long-range transportation plan that was adopted by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| Knoxville and Knox County and the surrounding area back in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| Because the comprehensive plan work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| from Advanced Knox is both a land use and transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| plan, we wanted to make sure that the two plans, these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| two major long-range plans for our community were going to be in alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| So the population projection models| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| that were developed from the mobility plan were current at the time of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| the start of the work of the Advanced Knox work, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| it just made great sense to take that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| work and apply it directly into the comp plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| Thank you, Teri, for clarifying that. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| I also understand that the current planned growth areas were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| considered for other uses. So, for instance, we have land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| in the current planned growth areas that have long been working farms, century| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| farms, or are in conservation easements, but those parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| could not be considered as rural areas, and I was just curious as to why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| And I ask that because we regularly, monthly actually, consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| changing rural areas to planned residential. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| what was the thinking about that, basically not pulling back any of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| existing planned growth areas? Yeah, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| a good question, Commissioner Frazier. One of the things that we looked at with that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| from a policy level decision, the mayor didn't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| roll back any of that PGA with some of those areas where there may be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| century farms and other very important farms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| in the community, really just due to the property rights associated with that. That was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| some of the things we talked to the Law Director's Office about, and we just had some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| concerns about the property rights diminishing with those parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| Can I add one extra thing in here? On a monthly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| basis, I don't believe you guys are changing the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| policy designation from rural to anything else. That's not what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| happening, and I think there is a little bit of confusion because in the growth policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| designations, you have a rural area, and then in the land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| classifications or our place types, you have rural areas, you have rural living and rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| conservation, and then in zoning, you have agricultural land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| Those are three very similarly titled, very similarly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| used designations, but they're not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| So you guys, none of the planned growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| designations, urban growth, planned growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| or rural, have been changed since 2000, with the exception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| of the urban growth boundary, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| changed because the city of Knoxville expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| So they absorbed some of that urban growth area into their corporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| limits. So there was a little bit of a change there when it came to the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| boundaries, but the rural area has not changed since 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| So I just wanted to make that very clear that when you are changing, you're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| sector plan amendments to the sector plans, or you're making rezoning changes, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| not to the growth policy plan. Thank you, Cathy, for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| That was great. And I also, too, want to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| the leadership team and also the mayor, because one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| the amendments that came before the coordinating committee was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| they were allowing rural place types in the planned growth areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| That was not originally the case, and so I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| thank you all for really hearing the public and the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| and making that change. That was a great change, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| I know that there have been some residents who are in current or proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| planned growth areas that do have conservation easements or legacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| farms that perhaps may have submitted a letter asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| to be excluded from the planned growth area. Is that going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| to be considered? And if so, how? And then how will the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| county then respond to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| Anyone? I can speak to that, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| Fraser. Yes. We, obviously, we just said we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| going to roll back any of the planned growth area, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| will look at those parcels a little bit closer when we look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| future land use map and potentially use those rural place types in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| Okay. Thank you, Mandy. And Mandy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| if you, for the record. Mandy Benedict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| the mayor's office. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| And what will protections look like in the place types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| and land use classifications for natural areas, open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| space, and forests located in the planned growth areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| I'll attempt to answer that one. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| there are several rural place types that support...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| So, there's rural conservation, there's rural living, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| rural conservation supports cluster development, and that specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| was identified as a place type that would be beneficial in this county because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| it can preserve significant areas with environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| constraints. Open space is also a place type that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| be applied to large areas that are either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| publicly held or not expected to change through the plan's horizon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| So, does that answer your question? Yes, it does. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| One thing that I wanted to point out, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| to the public, is that there are many areas in the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| planned growth areas that have either current, completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| or approved construction of development projects, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| in the 6th District. Much of the expanded planned growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| area, we've already got subdivisions there. So, I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| wanted to, just to publicly put that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| there, that it's important to look at what is under construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| where have we expanded utilities, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| this map had not been updated. So, there are quite a few,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| and I think there's been some confusion with that, so I just wanted to put that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| Also, I wanted to point out, too, because there was a question about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| planned growth area in the North Shore Choteau areas. It's my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| there was no change to the planned growth area in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| correct? Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| Let's see. What's the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| for future review and amendments to the growth map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2102)|
| 0:35:10| I'm not aware of any plans after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| What are the recommended, like what is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| good kind of standard practice or best practice for reviewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| a growth map? Five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| Three years? Ten years? I think the legislation said it needed to stay into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| The original legislation that was passed at the state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| five years, but I would say, you know, I've not consulted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| with all jurisdictions who have a growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| to see how often they have those updated, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| in terms of the legislation itself, every five years, but I think it's really dependent on the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| Okay. Thank you. And then the sector plans, they've got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| great deal of really useful information, and I understand we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| have more small area plans, which I think is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| great way to address community character and feel and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| specific needs and visions of a specific area. For instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| you know, Commissioner Lee's district, Hall's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| Powell High School, they all have a different vision for their needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| and really what they expect from us as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| a government. So I understand that. Is there going to be a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| that, and I think you've been working on this, where a list of the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| and the studies that will remain in use for future planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| purposes, I know that there's one in the back of the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| Could we also include a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| list of those? Yes. I believe, Commissioner, that those have already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| been added to the draft comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| That's great. All right. Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| Thanks for your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| You kind of already answered how often the amendments to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| the growth plan. What about amendments to the comprehensive plan and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| the future land use map? How often will those be reviewed and amended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| Well, it's still a draft plan, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| the planning commission hasn't specifically weighed in on their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| recommendation, but we heard some feedback last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| from the planning commission that there was some concern about how frequent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| those amendments would take place. Currently, they can happen on a monthly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| basis, and the proposal that will be going forward to the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| commission is on a quarterly basis. That would mirror what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| the city does for their plan. And is that for the first two years, or is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| until we review and see how things are going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| I think it's until we review and see how things are going, but for a minimum of three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| Okay. And then how are we going to address densities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| going forward? For instance, what's the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| difference between the suburban residential and suburban mixed-use residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| Well, as I mentioned, we have not updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| the zoning code, so that would be the next step. So, the zoning code is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| identifies exactly what you can do on individual parcels. So, we would still be bound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| by the current zoning code, which is primarily based with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| density. So, if you look in the comprehensive plan, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| it's Appendix H. Is that right? There's a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| type categories in zoning, which identifies those place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| types, future land use, and which zoning districts could be considered. I will say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| density can be regulated in two ways. So, requiring the maximum number of units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| per acre is one way, and that's what we've historically done in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| And then there's also a way of looking at it by looking at lot and billing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| dimensional standards. Regulating density units by acre is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| a blunt instrument. It's not really going to provide you with enough information to let you know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| development will actually look like on the ground. So, there are some limitations to that. I think once we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| get to updating the zoning code, those conversations need to happen in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| more detail. We need to have more conversation, more public input, and maybe some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| good examples of what we might want to consider going forward. So, the goal of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| process is really the county going from being reactive to proactive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| when it comes to growth and coordinating supportive infrastructure. So, how will the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| process ensure this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| So, one of the ways that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| this plan, the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| as well as the next step, the comprehensive plan, is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| help us be more proactive is a really simple one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| It's that we've already identified where we think development will go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| Now we don't have to chase after where development decides to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| So, we've already defined the areas that we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| are attractive for development and suitable for development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| and we can, for example, Jim's working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| a mobility study for that area of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| Ritter, Washington, Pike, because we can anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| that development will likely go there now. So, we can look over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| plan horizon year and say, okay, by 2045, we imagine that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| X number of homes will be built in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| and the roads will have to handle X AADT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| on those roadways. So, we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| use those plans to be able to submit to federal agencies, state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| agencies, and get grants because they're not going to give us money if we don't have a plan for how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| things are going to look and have a good justification for the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| and benefit of those investments. So, that's just one very, very simple way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| that having a plan in place and having everybody on board helps us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| to be more proactive. I'm sure there are other examples my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| can give. Thank you. Now that explains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| it perfectly. Director Snowden, do we have an estimated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| cost of new and improved roads in the expanded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| plan growth areas? We don't have that just yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| We are still working. As a matter of fact, I was working on the capital budget request that you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| will see later this year in addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| to Everett Road with the Watt Road. Obviously, very large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| improvement, including acquisition of property, design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| and construction. We're still working on that number, but historically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| our annual capital budget hovers around $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| So, over the next five years, we would anticipate to see somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| around $100 million. And to Kathy's point, that gives us the ability now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| knowing where this growth is liable to occur to better focus that expenditure, that $100 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| over the next five years. Great. Thank you. And I guess the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| answer is for the parks and recreational areas as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| Do that the same. And then questions about the school. I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| Knox County Schools, they've been a part of the process. They've seen the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| They've seen the expanded areas. They have their own subcommittee. I did reach out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| Dr. Reiswick and Garfield Adams, and they said that they look at student populations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| annually as a part of their capital plan. And that includes conducting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| five-year student enrollment projections with Knoxville-Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| Advanced Knox kind of showed us that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| what the county would look like in 20 years. And the schools have historically kept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| their focus to be intentionally far shorter because they don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| to be in a position of requesting the expenditure of public funds to construct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| schools based on a projection that might fall short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| In my opinion, the only way to do that is for our schools to be a stronger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| focus in the planning process. And I think that was actually identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| as one of the top three concerns and requests from all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| the data collected that folks want to see a more coordinated effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| between land use processes and school improvements or new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| So I'm hoping, and I would like to see a stronger component in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| comprehensive plan that does focus on managing impact on the schools as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| result of development. I didn't hear much discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| about this from Knox County Schools at the coordinating committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| meeting, and I just wanted to make sure that school impact is a priority. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| something that we can do in the comp plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| Sure. Actually, I was in a meeting with Garfield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| last week, and we talked again about it, and we want to set up meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| quarterly to where we discuss those things and make sure that our improvements are in line with theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| And Director Snowden, talk a little bit about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| UDO and how it will differ from current zoning ordinances, and will it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| strengthen our approach to land use and decision making, and then also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| will it include any cost sharing agreements, possibly for road improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| and will that be something that commission will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| be able to help create through an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| so that we have just a standard kind of cost sharing agreement, and then you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| execute those? Sure. Be glad to. And you're exactly right. The UDO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| is going to do, our ordinance now, as you all know, is very old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| and on a daily basis, we're trying to put a square peg in a round hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| So in addition just to the practical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| implications and improvements of the ordinance, one of the things we do want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| is assign minimum road standards based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| on the classification so that when developers come in, that we can work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| them and make sure that those roadways that they're adjoining, or that they tend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| to adjoin, have a standard that's current and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| reflects the needs of the community at that time. So that is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| that obviously that UDO will include a lot of public engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| as well as adoption by this body, so you guys will have a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| say in ultimately what that looks like as far as partnerships with developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| Thank you. And then my last question, I know you're glad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| What is the process for implementing the new growth map, the land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| classifications, the comp plan updates, and the UDO? Is there a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| transition plan that will kind of be put into place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| And what does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| I believe the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| would become effective May 1st. Was that the date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| Yes. And so it really just depends on when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| comprehensive plan is considered by the planning commission and if it's voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| by this body and if you all adopt it. I think our staff at Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| Knox County Planning would need at least 45 to 60 days in order to transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| There's some things that we do with our database| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| and how we track projects that will need to change. So obviously we would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| see this move forward as quickly as possible. We think it's a really good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2742)|
| 0:45:46| plan and it's going to move our county forward and we're anxious to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| started on working on this UDO because as Jim just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| mentioned, our ordinances are really dated and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| they need to be better aligned. Me too. And I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| say in summary really quickly, I hope that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| this really showcased the level of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| commitment and knowledge and work that the staff has done on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| this. I know that there's been tons of questions and concerns along the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| especially from different parts of the county and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| to me asking these questions and hearing how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| they are already thinking about things that are to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| that we will have to address. I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| want to applaud you all for doing that and thank you for bearing with me through my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| Thank you. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| J? Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| You talked about updating that zoning code and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| giving us the actual practical tools to then work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| Can you help me understand what that process might look like in the timeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| Is it going to require an outside consultant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| What's the general timeline and expense of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| What does that look like in a snapshot? Assuming of course it all goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| smoothly. I'll let Jim talk about the cost of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| It's going to take at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| 18 months to 2 years to update our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| As was mentioned, the UDO is different than what we currently have. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| all these separate ordinances and the idea behind a UDO is that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| combines these tools, additional zoning and subdivision regulations as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| other regulations in the county into one document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| That's going to take a little bit of time. It's going to take a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| collaboration internally and also a lot of input from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| Do you want to talk about the cost? I think on the cost, we've talked to a couple of consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| and actually done one RFQ and actually wasn't able to negotiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| a scope and fee with a consultant. I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| anticipate low end to be $500,000 and high end to be $750,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| for that 18 month process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| Do you anticipate that being broken over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| potentially 2 years of a fiscal cycle or allocating it all in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| one fiscal cycle? The intent originally was to allocate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| over just one cycle, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| obviously I can talk to the finance director about that, but the thought was to implement it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| over one fiscal year. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| Commissioner Schoonmaker. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| Madam Chair. I did want to just recognize two folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| in the audience tonight. The Vice Mayor of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| Town of Farragut, Louise Pavlin, is present and also one of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2922)|
| 0:48:46| big fans from the Knoxville Chamber, Amy Nolan, is with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2926)|
| 0:48:50| this afternoon, so good to see you. Mr. Snowden, in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| presentation about the rural area, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| mentioned that the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| classification will be 2 dwelling units per acre, but if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| something has already previously been zoned to 3 dwelling units, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| those properties will remain grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| So my question is, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| property would be maintained at the 3 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| but would they now be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| susceptible to upgrading the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2966)|
| 0:49:30| road to 18 feet in front of their property? Would they be now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| required if this passes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| Correct, and that would really apply even if this didn't pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| Depending on, we look at road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| width very related to the number of trips or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| average daily traffic that's on there, so we have processes in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| now, whether this plan approves or not, that if someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| adds a certain amount of traffic to the roadway that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| think creates unsafe or really unreasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| traffic conditions, we can ask them to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| those improvements to 18 or even greater than 18, depending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3010)|
| 0:50:14| on what their traffic analysis proposes. So we have that capability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| today, whether or not this plan moves forward or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| Okay, and do we have any idea how many parcels we have out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| that potentially could have 50% more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| dwelling units than what the new plan would have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| We don't know. I don't think we've looked at that. We can take a look at that and then try to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| you a little better insight in that before the work session and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| voting meeting on this, but unless someone else here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| knows, I don't believe that we have that exact number, no sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| Do you think it's nominal or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| nominal? No idea. I would want to reserve until we, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| we will look at that and see if we can get you a good answer on that by the end of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Snowden. Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3062)|
| 0:51:06| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| I want to thank everyone that's been involved with this. It's been a great process. I got to attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| quite a few of the meetings, and I know it's hard. You're not going to make everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| happy. That's part of being part of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| Jim, let's go back to the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| I know you guys are great on getting federal funding grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| Something like the city did last year, their recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| Is there some funding out there? You're talking $750,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| I know it's a process, but I know you guys will look for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| if it's possible. We will. I don't know. The TPO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| has had some planning grants recently, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| don't know if this would be applicable, but certainly we will review any of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| options and availabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3114)|
| 0:52:06| I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| Are we still going to have or be speaking about sector plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| If the comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| land use and transportation plan is updated, that will be the plan that would get amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| Sector plans would no longer be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| something that were updated on a regular basis, but the whole idea behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| having this one plan is that we update it with more frequency, and then we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| focus on smaller areas, which we already do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| Looking at corridors, looking at small area, being a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| proactive in our planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| That segues well into my next question. When you talk about the UDO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| combining documents, the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| then would in fact be one of those documents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| No, the sector plan is considered a component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| of the current general plan, so it's a long-range plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| But we won't be talking about sector plans anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| Under the UDO, you made the comment that it's going to combine several documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3194)|
| 0:53:18| What would those documents be that we refer to now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| I'll let my colleagues as well jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| The zoning ordinance, and then the subdivision regulations, which we utilize to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| divide land. Jim, do you want to speak about other things you're thinking about including?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| We would like to include really everything that touches the development community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| for really transparency and convenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| Obviously we have building codes, fire codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| we have stormwater, floodplains, sinkholes, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| really anything that an applicant does as it relates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| to the development of land in Knox County, we would like to incorporate in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| including road standards as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| Speaking to road standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| appreciate the forward thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| will this in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3254)|
| 0:54:18| help or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| impede| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| places where the development got ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| of the roads as far as your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| capital plans? I mean, how you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| spend your dollars from year to year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| You know, Hardin Valley is a good example of that. Obviously your district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| where it got ahead of it. It does add cost to it because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3286)|
| 0:54:50| obviously the more developed it is around it, the more cost we have for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| the right-of-way acquisitions and the construction constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| So yeah, there will be some additional cost there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| but we hope to obviously minimize those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| especially with some of the studies we're going to do in getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3306)|
| 0:55:10| rid of communities. But unfortunately there will be some additional cost there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3310)|
| 0:55:14| just because of us lagging behind in that road improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| Alright, but that doesn't make what's already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| happened go away, I mean as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| getting it fixed. Correct, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| When the discussion comes up about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| roads and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3334)|
| 0:55:38| future development, is the UDO going to specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| address what will be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| of builders with land that touches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| their development? And also, will there be any requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| as to development beyond what might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| specifically touch their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| but is part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| a really crappy road? Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| that is one of the things that we want to do is to have a set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| of roadway standards that better inform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| the public as well as the developer of what their responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| and expectations will be. I know that's one of the things that we talked about on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| the onset is making the process more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| transparent and folks being able to see the end result and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| that looks like because the process is convoluted. So my goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| would be to have standards in place that people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| the development community as well as the folks that attend the meetings that may have concerns about the surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| development, that they all know what the anticipation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| the Knox County Government Highway Department would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| Thank you. Thank you so much. Mr. Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| Oh, I'm sorry. Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| Thank you, Madam Chair. Over the last 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| years, there's been some small area corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| studies and corridor plans initiated where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| the community was engaged along with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| county officials and an agreement was made. Under the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| directives, if that passes, would those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| corridor studies that they made in agreement with the community, would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| those all be negated? No, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| believe so, Commissioner. So there are a list of plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| that have been adopted by this body and those were, you know, once they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| are adopted by this body, then they're adopted into what was the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| And so the thinking is that those plans that were adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| would be part of this new comprehensive land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| transportation plan and they were taken into consideration. There's a list that's included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| in the draft plan of those. And I can read those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| off if you like or I can just send them to everybody after this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| Is there quite a few? There's the East County Community Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3486)|
| 0:58:10| Alcoa Highway Corridor Study, the French Broad Corridor Study, the Governor John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| Sevier Highway Corridor Study, the Major Road Plan, the Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| Corridor Study, the Hardin Valley Mobility Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| Did I miss any? That's all of them. How about ones that go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| 15 to 16 to 18 years ago? Is there one specifically that you're thinking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| There was the Fox Road Corridor Plan and it was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| It was adopted, so we can go back and check to make sure that we've not missed any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| That should be included. Thank you. Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3518)|
| 0:58:42| Did you? No. Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| also while we're waiting on Commissioner Beeler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| for the record to reflect all 11 commissioners are present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3534)|
| 0:58:58| at this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| Oh, you're on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| Yes, I have. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3550)|
| 0:59:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3558)|
| 0:59:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| Yes, I have. Okay. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| I just had a quick comment. It may be a little premature, but I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| Commissioner Schoonmaker's line of questions sort of led me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| to this when he asked about how existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| densities would be treated. For instance, if something were already zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| at, say, 3 Freck or something of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3590)|
| 0:59:54| Should this growth policy plan be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| ratified? I believe I understood it would go into effect May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| 1st. Was that correct? Did I hear that date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3602)|
| 1:00:06| Okay. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| yeah, that date kind of notwithstanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| I want to encourage my colleagues to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| respect its intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3618)|
| 1:00:22| prior to that. Because while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3622)|
| 1:00:26| it may not be quote unquote law before May 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3626)|
| 1:00:30| it's still long overdue and it's more reflective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| of what people want and expect than what we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| So just in case, I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| important that we at least consider and respect the intent of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240205?start=3642)|
