| 0:00:29| Welcome to the monthly meeting of the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=29)|
| 0:00:42| I am Janice Toker, Chair of the Planning Commission, and I will be conducting today's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=42)|
| 0:00:49| To my right is Executive Director of Knoxville-Knox County Planning, Gerald Green, and to my left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=49)|
| 0:00:55| assisting me with today's agenda, is the Planning Commission's Attorney, Steve Wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=55)|
| 0:01:00| Around the table are planning commissioners, as well as planning staff and various representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=60)|
| 0:01:04| of the city and county agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=64)|
| 0:01:07| The planning commissioners are citizens from the city and county who have been appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=67)|
| 0:01:12| by either the city mayor or county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=72)|
| 0:01:15| We receive no salary and volunteer our time as a service to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=75)|
| 0:01:20| I hope all of you picked up an agenda handout in the lobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=80)|
| 0:01:24| In addition to the agenda, this handout includes information about the city-county building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=84)|
| 0:01:28| and how today's meeting will be conducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=88)|
| 0:01:31| Many of the items we vote on require further action by the city council or the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=91)|
| 0:01:37| and in the handout is a meeting schedule for these legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=97)|
| 0:01:41| For matters that are forwarded to the county commission for final action, particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=101)|
| 0:01:45| rezoning requests, the applicant must be present at the county commission meeting at which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=105)|
| 0:01:50| the request will be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=110)|
| 0:01:54| Applicants will be notified of the meeting date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| If you have any questions regarding the meeting date or process, contact planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=116)|
| 0:02:03| I would also like to refer you to the Knoxville-Knox County Planning's outstanding website, www.knoxplanning.org,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=123)|
| 0:02:10| for an online agenda and additional information about this and future meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=130)|
| 0:02:15| Today's meeting will be conducted in the order of the printed agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| Now a word about how discussion will take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=139)|
| 0:02:23| After each item is called, I will read the staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=143)|
| 0:02:27| On certain items, I will call on staff to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=147)|
| 0:02:30| At this time, the applicant may address the commission or defer his or her opening remarks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=150)|
| 0:02:36| and allow any opposition to speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=156)|
| 0:02:39| The applicant and those in support of the applicant will be given a total of five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=159)|
| 0:02:44| to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| I will then ask for other comments from the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=165)|
| 0:02:48| The opposition will also be given a total of five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| If either side wishes to rebut, you will need to reserve time from your allotted five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=173)|
| 0:03:00| Speakers should limit their remarks to the facts of the case and avoid repeating comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| that have been previously presented to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=184)|

| 0:03:12| of any speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=192)|
| 0:03:15| Because of the number of items we have before us, groups in favor or opposed to an item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| are asked to appoint a spokesperson to represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| All speakers should come to the podium and speak directly into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=203)|
| 0:03:28| You will need to state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=208)|

| 0:03:34| those to the staff seated at either end of the platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=214)|

| 0:11:13| We have 29, 30, and 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| I don't see anyone else on their way up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| Mr. Breschko.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| Just clarification on item 2, the approval of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| We had talked Tuesday about whether or not we were going to combine two of the items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| and that's why it was not on the consent list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| So we are removing item number 2 from the consent list, and I thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=692)|
| 0:11:38| I'd like to make a motion that we approve consent as read, with the exceptions of items number 2, 29, 30, and 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=698)|

| 0:12:09| Well, at Mr. Breschko's assistance, we didn't approve the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=729)|
| 0:12:15| so the motion needs to be to approve an agenda with the combining of 14 and 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| We approve the agenda with the combining of item number 14 and item number 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=741)|
| 0:12:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| Okay, the motion is to approve the agenda by combining item number 14 and 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=751)|
| 0:12:40| Motion by Commissioner Clancy, second by Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=760)|

| 0:13:10| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| I do want to insert one item into our agenda that is not on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=792)|
| 0:13:19| This past week, we lost someone that was a very important part of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| and an important part of our planning commission, Arthur Seymour, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=804)|

| 0:16:09| And I'm going to turn this over to Mr. Green to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=969)|
| 0:16:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| This was presented, a draft was presented a couple of weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| to the Planning Commission of an ordinance amendment to allow an approval process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| that we hope would allow for some creativity on the part of design professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=988)|
| 0:16:35| in proposing plans for development of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| and provide some flexibility in the approval of those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| Based on discussion at the agenda review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| I'll be working with planning commissioners to revise and add clarifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1004)|
| 0:16:51| working a couple of different angles, both to add some clarification to the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| and look at our planned residential approval process to see if that might be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| And I appreciate the comments of the commission on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| I look forward to working with you as we craft this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| I do think it's a great vehicle for doing something that would benefit the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| We have to get the vehicle built correctly, so that may take some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| So I've been debating, looking at my schedule, whether to request a 60- or 90-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1035)|
| 0:17:22| And I'm going to be optimistic and request a 60-day, recommend a 60-day postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| and hope we can get it done in that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| But I think more important than the time in which we do this is doing it right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| so it may come back before you for another postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| But please, as you have comments, thoughts on this, please feel free to contact me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1056)|
| 0:17:42| and we'll sit down and work through this, and I'll be sending out some thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| over the next week of approaches to this and look forward to working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1069)|

| 0:18:03| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| We are on to item number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1084)|
| 0:18:16| So I'll also be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| Item eight is a one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| The city charter requires future zoning conform to the city's comprehensive development plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| and it requires this annual preparation and adoption of a one-year comprehensive development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| covering the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| Fifteen and five-year development plans, which are what we refer to as our sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| are prepared to provide policy guidance on long- and mid-range development issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| and serve as a guide for the development of the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| So the one-year plan is specifically designed to be the foundation for land use regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| and short-term public improvements and is used as a basis for rezoning decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| throughout the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| So pursuant to the requirements of the city charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| planning staff has completed the 2019 annual update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| and is recommending that the commission approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| Motion to approve the Knoxville one-year plan 2019 update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1147)|
| 0:19:12| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips, a second by Commissioner Clancy to approve the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1152)|
| 0:19:18| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| We are on to agenda item number 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1164)|
| 0:19:32| This is under subdivision report concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| Subdivision is the Gables at Westmoreland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1176)|
| 0:19:39| The applicant is a Homestead Land Holdings, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| The location is the east end of Old Kent Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| The approximate acreage is 18.94 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| Zoning is R1 low-density residential and F1 floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| The existing land use is vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| The proposed use is detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| The number of lots is 27 and there are no variances required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| The staff recommendation is to approve the concept plan for 27 detached residential units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1211)|
| 0:20:17| on individual lots subject to 11 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| I think that I know that there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| I see a lot of yellow out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| Would the applicant like to go first or the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| We'll let the opposition go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| I see a lot of them in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| You have a total of five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| My name is Bart Carey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| I'm 7008 Sherwood Drive, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| I'm here today on behalf of the three neighborhood associations that are affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| and surround this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| First is Westmoreland Estates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| It's 126 households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| It's the Lawford area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| Old Kent, 42 households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| And the old Westmoreland, which is Westmoreland Heights, is 168 households| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| for a total of 336 residential units, over 1,100 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| And probably 1,080 of those people have rarely been involved with land use decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| and are very concerned about traffic and floods and all the issues that you hear all about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1278)|
| 0:21:25| but are kind of built into this application and already kind of been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| What we are here to do today is request a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| And there's a couple of reasons, or at least one reason with twofold direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| The first is the neighborhood awareness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| You may have received an email last night that showed a photograph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| taken from where the right-of-way is for this neighborhood where you would see this sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| It's 168 feet from the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| I'm sure the sign was placed technically where it needed to be, on the subject property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| and in the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| It was unfortunately behind a bush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| But the point is no one could see this sign or would ever be aware of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| in any of the three neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| And the word actually spread by the postal carrier letting a neighbor know that an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| had been made for a group mailbox of 20-something units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| And the word kind of spread from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| One of the nearest neighbors didn't know about it until this past Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| So the neighborhood has been unaware of this development for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| And our objective is to, our neighbors want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| We're a very concerned group of neighborhoods, not just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| As a matter of fact, the neighbors, a lot of them are here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| A lot of them took time off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| If you're here, please stand if you live in these neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| And again, that's all three neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| And I think what we'd like to tell you is that we've met collectively before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| When we've had a development that came, you may sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1368)|
| 0:22:54| We had a development that came in on the west end that affected all three neighborhood groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| And we grouped together to meet with a developer at the Baptist Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| had over 150 people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| And we came up with meaningful solutions to come up with our concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| and for the developer to meet his needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| And that's what we want to talk about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| The faith in the system, we have a lot of people that don't understand how this could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| And so that's what we want to share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| The next thing I want to show is a couple of pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| And these are not exact, and they're only made for an illustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| The subject property slopes up on Sherwood Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| with the backside of Sherwood Drive down to the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| And it's approximately, and again, this is not to scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| It's only meant for an illustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| You can turn it back over this way too, Matt, so Mr. Muller can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| This is a wooded hillside that protects the runoff, and it's a pretty consistent slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| What has been proposed, and again, I know this is, I want to stress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| this is just for illustration purposes, roughly to scale but not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| What's going to happen is the hill is going to be cut from the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| and a level plain is going to be created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| There's going to be a 32-foot cut bank on the backside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| and a 30-something fill on the lower side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| Now, thanks, Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| If this was possibly a rezoning, which it's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| this might fall under the auspices of the hillside and ridgetop protection area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| because it falls directly in that red area on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| But we're not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| But the point is this is the kind of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| this is a poster child for what the hillside and ridgetop protection area would be looking to prevent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1472)|
| 0:24:40| It's going to create, even though the lots are ranging in size from a third of an acre to a half acre or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1480)|
| 0:24:48| the realistic size of those lots, after you put the bank in the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| and the falloff bank in the rear, they're going to be effectively much smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| And so the actual lot size will be 250 feet deep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| but to the bottom of the cut bank on the uphill side, maybe 140 or 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1500)|
| 0:25:06| This whole thing, here's our major concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| Neighborhoods on three sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| The killer is on the north side is the Bomb Drive Industrial Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| So we can't argue with the fact, it's not our business whether the developer can sell a $700,000 house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1514)|
| 0:25:20| overlooking an industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| That's between he and his clientele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| What we're concerned about is we surround this on three sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| We would love to sit down with the developer, but more importantly, his design team, Mr. Rackley, the engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| who knows there's challenges on this site, to see what we can do to maybe minimize how it affects the three sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| Because when this bowl gets cut out and they're looking right at that industrial park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| three different neighborhoods are going to be looking at the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| And we would like to encourage some way to buffer our neighborhoods from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| We also have traffic concerns we'd like to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| Mr. Carey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| Is our time up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| Your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| Madam Chair, I'd like to give them another two minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| Two minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| You have another two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| Again, I respectfully ask for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| We'll save the rest of our time for rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| Applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| And maybe I should say for anyone else who wants to speak, I've hogged this thing pretty good so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| Yeah, you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, Suite 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| Let me first say on behalf of the law firm of Francis McCollum Seymour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| thank you very much for the kind words, Mr. Seymour, and the resolution you passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1598)|
| 0:26:45| The concept plan approval that's before you is the culmination of one year of study in this piece of property by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1605)|
| 0:26:55| This property is zoned R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| It has been zoned R1 since the 1960s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| And as staff has set forth in its report, it meets all the requirements for an R1 development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1621)|
| 0:27:10| There's nothing that is out of the ordinary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| There's no variances that are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| There are 11 conditions that will need to be worked out with the staff moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1635)|
| 0:27:24| This is not the end of this inquiry as far as what needs to be done on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| It's the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| And there was concerns about the hilltop protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| I'd like to point out that this piece of property is not in the hilltop protection overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1656)|
| 0:27:44| The density allowed on this is a lot greater than the 27 acres that is in this concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1664)|
| 0:27:52| and we will continue to work with staff to address all of the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| Now, we've tried to reach out to the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| We've had several neighbors that did contact us when they learned of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| and we have emailed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| We've tried to set up meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| Mr. Mone, who is here, canceled his plans so he could meet with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| but we never could get that scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| We met with several of them that showed up Tuesday after the workshop and spoke with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| and we will continue to work with them about their concerns moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| even after this concept plan is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| I understand there's construction concerns and noise and things like that during the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| We understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| We want to be good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| We'll continue to talk to them, but there's no reason to delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| or postpone this development from moving forward with this concept plan stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| You know, this is under a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| To delay it would mean we would have to get an extension on the contract, which isn't guaranteed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| and we've put a year's worth of work to try to make it fit within the existing zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| so it would not be out of character with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| It's an R1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| We try to make it work within the R1 zone for that very reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| because, you know, it is a beautiful neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| and we want to continue that tradition to make beautiful homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| Now, there was some concern about the sign, and I think if I heard Mr. Carey correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| he says, well, we put it pretty much the only place you could put it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| and if I could, I've got two handouts I'd like to introduce into the record on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1762)|
| 0:29:29| The first is just a KGIS map showing where the sign was located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1769)|
| 0:29:37| which is at the only place that has any frontage, any right-of-way on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| and the second is going to be a group of photographs starting down Old Kent Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| at the intersection of Gatehead, which you want to pass those out while I'm doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| And these two for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| At the intersection of Gatehead, looking straight down Old Kent Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| and you can see the yellow sign there in the corner beside the mailbox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1802)|
| 0:30:08| and if you look at the scale for that, that is several hundred feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| And the second photograph, as you're going down Old Kent Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| is further back from the intersection of Scottswood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| where you can see the sign there beside the mailbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| Clearly, you can't read it, but you can see there's a yellow sign there posted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| and then there at the terminus of Old Kent, which is the only place where the sign could have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| you can see the subdivision notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| There's no question that this sign wasn't placed properly and legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1834)|
| 0:30:43| So we've complied with everything that this board has asked us to comply with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| that staff has asked us to comply with, and we will continue to talk to the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| Some of them are just now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| I understand Friday, I think, is when the word really got out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| because there was a petition that went around at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| and that's when a lot of the conversations started with some of the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| There were some neighbors that were attorneys that reached out to us earlier on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| that we discussed our plans with them, tried to assuage some of their concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| talked about the restrictions that are going to be on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| things that we're trying to do to be good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| But again, a postponement would actually jeopardize this project after a year's worth of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1878)|
| 0:31:27| and that's just not something that is acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| It's something that's not authorized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| There's no legal reason to deny this concept plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| We still have to work with staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| We still have to talk to the neighbors moving forward about if there's concerns about the construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| and we'll be willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| But we ask that you not postpone this concept plan approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| that you vote on it today and follow the staff's report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| that this complies completely with the regulations within the existing zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| Mr. Frisch, do I have a question about the hillside ridgetop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| Mr. Mullen said that it is not within the hillside ridgetop overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| Part of the property is within hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1933)|
| 0:32:19| We'll probably be able to show it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| It's not the entire property that's shown on, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| one of the maps that was brought up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| You can see it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| And was that taken in consideration in the staff recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1951)|
| 0:32:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| I mean, the one thing they could do is request a reduction of the right-of-way and pavement width on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1961)|
| 0:32:48| But unlike a review for a planned residential district where we have use-on-review criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1968)|
| 0:32:55| that looks at compliance with the sector plan and other adopted plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| and looking at the subdivision under the R1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| we look out for compliance with the subdivision regulations and the R1 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| It does not bring in the plans as a part of that review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=1993)|
| 0:33:20| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| Yeah, I just was going to ask a question about lot widths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| I couldn't tell on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| What are the lot widths on these lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2006)|
| 0:33:33| Eighty-nine feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| Eighty-nine feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| On the plan, they're 79 feet, 48 inches more than the required 75-foot width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2017)|
| 0:33:43| which I'm sure if you added up those lots on one side of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| if you could have gotten one more lot by adding up 14 times 48,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| you still don't get a 75-foot lot, so they died at 79 feet on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| I mean, my thoughts on this, and I'm very familiar with the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| is the lots are the plans submitted under the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| You're not asking for a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| I don't think there's a lot, you know, you can say about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| because they're developing this under the same guidelines as the rest of Scottswood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| and Lawford and some of those other areas at the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| So I don't know that 30 days is going to do any good, but at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| you are working around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| and you're going to have to be working around as the developer all these neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| and I don't know what 30 days would hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| You know, if it creates good relationships, I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| maybe that's something to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| My opinion is it's probably not going to change a lot, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| I just have another question for staff about the hillside and protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| I wasn't quite clear on why the hillside and protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| specifically the reduction in grading and clearing, doesn't get applied to this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2093)|
| 0:35:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| Under the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| you could request a reduction of the right-of-way width and pavement width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| You can go down to 40 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| So that request to reduce the pavement, the right-of-way width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| could bring the lots a little bit closer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| but it's not going to make a significant difference in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| And keep in mind, too, that the hillside birch top protection plan is not codified at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2121)|
| 0:35:27| It's recommendations only that the staff can make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| and so that makes it a somewhat difficult vehicle to use to mandate requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| when it has not been codified at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| I'd like to first start out by saying that Mr. Mone has a fabulous reputation as a home builder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2147)|
| 0:35:53| and has been a great asset to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| You probably couldn't have a better guy over there doing the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2157)|
| 0:36:02| Number two, the property is zoned, and it's been zoned that way for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2162)|
| 0:36:08| and it is going to be developed, just when it's going to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| But three, you know, you've got a whole lot of people here that are uneasy with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2173)|
| 0:36:19| and I certainly recognize a lot of these names here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| and, you know, not that it's necessarily going to change anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| but, I mean, I certainly could support a postponement for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2187)|
| 0:36:35| Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| I also agree with Commissioner Smith and also Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2197)|
| 0:36:44| I think it's been very evident that when neighborhoods are included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2204)|
| 0:36:51| and given the time to give their opinion on things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2211)|
| 0:36:58| it just seems like we've seen that always work out into a great plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2218)|
| 0:37:05| So I would definitely want a 30-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2225)|
| 0:37:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| Mr. Mullins, I've got a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| Mr. Mullins, when you answer, if you could come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2238)|
| 0:37:24| You mentioned earlier that you had, as a group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| had made an effort to meet with the neighbors, which I think, which is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| we really like to see that, but I'd like to hear more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| Tell me about your efforts to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2256)|
| 0:37:47| I don't know if I need to pass out the e-mail chains that have gone back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| I mean, initially we were contacted by two attorneys, Culver Schmidt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| and Wayne Ritchie, who live in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| Although they said they were not necessarily representing any of the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| they understood some of the neighbors had concerns, just like they had some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| And there were several meetings with them specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| talking about everything that went into the design, how they've looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| why they have done certain things, whether they could, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| need 27 lots to make it economically feasible, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| concerns about, you know, the clearing and the hillsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| and all the things that have been talked about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| There was even some back and forth from one of the attorneys, Mr. Schmidt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| with proposed restrictions to be placed on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| because ultimately there will be an HOA there with restricted restrictions in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| And I think we even told Mr. Schmidt we would adopt some of his suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| That was the initial round of conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| and so we thought we had, because we had two professionals that said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2334)|
| 0:39:00| that they were representing interests other neighbors had, we had bet with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| Then we received some e-mails, and when the petition went around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| from Ms. Conley, who is, I believe, on the board of the Westmoreland Homeowner Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| I might be wrong on that. I think that's the one that she was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| And there were several e-mails back and forth about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| we would love to sit down and meet with you. When are you going to meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| And then will we have to get together ourselves to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| That would be Monday night. Can we come to the Monday night meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| There was kind of some silence on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| Maybe Tuesday, when can I do that? I'll have to change my travel plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| I did change my travel plans. Can we still get together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| And then, of course, when we had Tuesday's workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| we had some members there that we spent at least 30, 45 minutes outside speaking to them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2381)|
| 0:39:51| I got an e-mail last night, myself, at 9.42 p.m. from Mr. Barrett, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2391)|
| 0:39:59| who is the president of the Westmoreland Homeowner Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| which I responded to. Can we talk before this meeting even?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| And I've assured them that we'll continue to talk to them about these other issues moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| I mean, this is a concept plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| And I understand. I've been doing this long enough that working with the neighbors is essential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| We've tried to do that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| But we do disagree that 30 days wouldn't really hurt anything for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| It would. That is beyond our current extension, and we have no guarantees to get another extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2426)|
| 0:40:32| We have worked on this for quite some time, and 30 days could be the end of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2432)|
| 0:40:38| I don't think I'm overstating that because, you know, they may not want to sell to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2438)|
| 0:40:44| They may not want to give another extension, but right now it's under an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2444)|
| 0:40:49| So, yes, that does create an issue that we are not guaranteed to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| And with the concessions, I think, both from Mr. Carey and some of the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2454)|
| 0:41:00| that it might not make a difference because this is such a straightforward project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2460)|
| 0:41:07| We designed it that way to exist within the community, within the existing zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| What would work for this particular piece of project instead of coming in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| and trying to put a square peg in a round hole and ask for a bunch of variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| and a rezoning and things like that, which we often see for undeveloped land in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| We're not doing that. We want to work within this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| and we want to continue to work with them moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| but we can't abide a postponement at this stage in the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| Mr. Bretzko, what's the allowed density in R1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2497)|
| 0:41:44| What would be allowed in the R1 zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| You can do a 7,500-square-foot lot with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| The actual density that they're proposing in here is 1.4 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| and people probably could achieve more of a four DUs per acre under the R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2518)|
| 0:42:04| It depends on the layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| In this case, a third of the property is actually in common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| Not only do they have some of the hillside, they also have the stream protection area and buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| So the areas along the stream, the floodway, flood fringe areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| the majority of that's within the common area, the open space area that remains on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| It will not be disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| One of the things, too, that a lot of times, let's say if you were applying the hillside regulations to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2551)|
| 0:42:38| it makes a big difference in how the property lays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| I mean, when we go and apply a density for hillside under like a PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| and because of that steeper slopes we come out with a lower density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| let's say two dwelling units per acre instead of five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| still putting two dwelling units per acre on a piece of property and the way it lays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| you're not always going to be able to protect all the areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| If it's laid out that the steeper part is in the back of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| and you have a large enough area to cluster the developments, you can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| If the hillside or the topography rolls across the whole property to put a road into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| it's going to be very difficult to protect the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| So it's a case-by-case basis as to how much you can actually do to protect the hillside in that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2598)|
| 0:43:25| So more than likely what I'm hearing is if they had asked for 40 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| the hillside, if we compared it with the hillside, it might reduce it to two or 1.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| And they're at 1.4 with the density that they're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| We do still have some lights on, but we also, Mr. Cary, you folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| the opposition still has time on the clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| so if you'd like to continue addressing the commission, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| Just real quickly, in terms of representation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| Culver Schmidt and Wayne Ritchie are two private residents that live in Old Kent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| They just called us as concerned citizens, not as representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| They don't claim any representation in this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| A very few number of homeowners were approached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| but none of the HOA chairs from any of the three neighborhoods were ever contacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2648)|
| 0:44:14| And so we grouped together individually in our own little groups to figure out how we can get together as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2654)|
| 0:44:21| We know that if we don't get something, if this gets passed today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| we have no chance for any substantive change in any kind of buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| or modification that might help protect our fringe on this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| And if industrial heights development, excuse me, if the gables at Westmoreland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| if that passes today, we have no way to go back and make anything happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| We've never suggested, number one, that this didn't meet the criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2684)|
| 0:44:49| and we never suggested that it should have been ruled under the hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| It's just, it would have been a perfect, it's a poster child for that whole situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2693)|
| 0:44:58| There's a creek down below it that feeds, actually feeds the water wheel, ironically, that turns that water wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2698)|
| 0:45:05| The sign, I've seen this body before postponed because of a unique sign placement situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| It's not unprecedented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| Most, I've heard Mr. Mullins discuss the extension or lack thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| I've got to believe any contract they have could be extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2719)|
| 0:45:25| We asked for that postponement so we can possibly make some change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| and it's not so much to beg the developers, it's to work with the engineering team to come up with some help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| That stub out was created 35 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| We're asking for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| We hope you can help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| I think what makes this case unusual is we have legal notice, but practically speaking, I think it's inadequate notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2745)|
| 0:45:56| I think the vast majority of these residents would never have seen this sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2756)|
| 0:46:03| and this is really a tough case in the sense that they have complied legally in every respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2763)|
| 0:46:11| The sign is in a dead end, obscure place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| and it may cause us to take notice and think about, in unusual cases like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2776)|
| 0:46:25| that we add a directional sign to lead the public to the rezoning sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2785)|
| 0:46:33| and that's one thing that I may suggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| The applicant has done everything legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| As long as he wants to go forward, I don't see that anyone can do anything to prevent it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2800)|
| 0:46:47| and that's why it's especially tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| But I think this body has always encouraged the community involvement with the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2809)|
| 0:47:00| And that's all of my comments for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| And, sir, you're with the applicant, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| And you have some more time on the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| Did you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| We would need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| Russ Rackley, Rackley Engineering, PO Box 30456, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| Being the individual that put up the sign and being the individual that picked up the sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| and discussed with staff at the help desk at MPC with this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| with what limited right-of-way frontage there was, where do I put the sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| And was told, on my property, where it abuts the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| I understand they say there's a bush there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| Thankfully, there's no leaves on that bush this time of year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| I was very concerned about that from the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| but I would ask anyone who thinks it wasn't noticeable enough is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| where would you have had me put the sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| Whose property should I have put the sign on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| I mean, I could have stuck it out on Westland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| but that would have been kind of vague and misleading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| and not the requirement of the form they had me sign saying I would place the sign on the subject property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2876)|
| 0:48:03| where it abuts the public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| It wasn't an effort to obscure or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| I'm an engineer. I'm a rule follower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| I was trying to follow the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| I guess if you are so inclined, and I certainly hope you are not, to delay this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2895)|
| 0:48:21| is to make some clear direction on where to place the sign next time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| because I don't want to be back here again with individuals making the same claim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2904)|
| 0:48:30| From an engineering standpoint, I have laid this thing out seven different ways from Sunday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2910)|
| 0:48:35| and this is the best use of this property to make it fit both our desires and our needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2915)|
| 0:48:41| and the character of the neighborhood and the natural topography of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| There's really nothing else that we can do with this property other than the plan that we have before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2926)|
| 0:48:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| Thank you, Mr. Rackley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2931)|
| 0:48:52| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| In the big scope of things right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| we're trying to, the developers are trying to develop poorer pieces of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2942)|
| 0:49:09| that are left over than they were 30 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| and it makes the development difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| and as I said, they've been working on it for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| and this is the best they could come up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| but if you work on something for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| I'm not too sure that maybe another month to work with another group wouldn't be a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2967)|
| 0:49:34| and I'm going to move that we postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| We have a motion by Commissioner Graf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| a second by Commissioner Buston to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| Before we take a vote, we do have more lights on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| and I'd like to hear from the other commissioners, starting with Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| Yeah, a question for staff, and then a question for the engineer, for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=2994)|
| 0:50:01| For staff, on the notice of adjoining property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| is it the responsibility of the applicant to notify the adjoining property owners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| Do we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| Planning staff does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| It's notice to the abutting property owners within 250 feet of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| So there would have been, obviously, adequate notice, at least on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| I'm not saying that covers anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| If I can add to that, my initial reaction was thinking that they would have gotten a notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3023)|
| 0:50:29| and I'm not certain, but the notice is sent on rezonings, use-on-reviews, plan amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3029)|
| 0:50:38| and this is just a standalone concept, so it's possible that notice was not sent out to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3038)|
| 0:50:44| Okay, so that would be a question for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| We don't have that many cases where we have a standalone concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| Most of the time we're used to the use-on-review attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| That might be something that staff wants to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| And that's something we are looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| We have different notice requirements, distance based on zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| What we're looking at is unifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| or making one notice requirement for all applications that come before this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3067)|
| 0:51:08| And then my question for the applicant's engineer is, just to get it on record for the opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3068)|
| 0:51:17| because they asked, and I would assume that you guys would be getting together if this ends up getting postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3077)|
| 0:51:24| I'm trying to look at your plans on the grading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| and it looks to me like you've left some existing property not touched on, I guess that would be the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3086)|
| 0:51:37| What kind of buffer are you planning on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| Yes, we are holding the disturbance away as much as we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| and still create the building pads, pad depth that we need for this product,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| which this is kind of a very deep product because the lots are a little more narrow with the garages in the rear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3108)|
| 0:51:54| kind of a Charleston kind of front porch feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| It's around 20 to 25 foot buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| Plus, that is the only part of the property, the south side, that has significant trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3122)|
| 0:52:08| A big portion of the property, and the neighbors will attest, until Mr. Bonneman passed, he kept cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| So it's all leafed now, but it's small privet and scrub type growth, no significant specimen trees or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3133)|
| 0:52:23| So, yeah, we are trying to, that was intentional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| to try to maintain some buffer along that southern border abutting those larger states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3146)|
| 0:52:34| Commissioner Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| I'm struggling with the postponement, mainly because this case that's come before us is within the legal zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3161)|
| 0:52:49| It's half the density that they could be asking for on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| This property is on the same thing as the property surrounding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| I'm appreciative of the input from the community, but I'm also appreciative of what we set these rules up for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3178)|
| 0:53:08| And I'm appreciative of the development that they've worked on it for a year to work this out to where it's, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3188)|
| 0:53:13| is a decent development for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| And I don't see how postponing for 30 days is going to change any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3196)|
| 0:53:22| It's perfectly legal the way it stands right now, and I don't see any reason to postpone it or deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3202)|
| 0:53:29| Mr. Breschke, do you have something you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| One consideration, I mean, if this is postponed, one of the things the applicant can look at, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| they can request from the city and the city would have to decide if they would support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3218)|
| 0:53:44| a reduction of the right-of-way and pavement width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| It's not going to help a great deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| but it may allow for a little additional buffer on that south side in making that slight adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3229)|
| 0:53:57| Commissioner Crowder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| I know we've discussed the placement of the sign three or four times, but I'm pretty familiar with this area also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3241)|
| 0:54:07| I lived there for 17 years, and the sign was placed probably in the only area that it could be placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3247)|
| 0:54:14| And I agree with Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| There needs to be another arrangement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| but it's difficult to find the opposition to let you have a sign in their yard warning a change in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3258)|
| 0:54:26| The problem with the placement of this sign coming down Gatehead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3266)|
| 0:54:32| Kent was just a loop until the lower section was built, so everyone either went to the right or left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3272)|
| 0:54:39| If you go to the right where the sign is placed, there's only about 14 houses which would be visible to this sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3279)|
| 0:54:46| They'd have to drive by it going to their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| If you go to the left, that's where the majority of the neighborhood lies, and you would bypass the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3288)|
| 0:54:54| But close-knit communities communicate with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| So everyone who did see the sign, if you have an HOA, you need to contact and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| hey, there's going to be change in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| We need to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| I agree with three of the other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| I don't know what 30 days would resolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3310)|
| 0:55:14| We've postponed several times since I've been on commission, and the same arguments are still before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3314)|
| 0:55:22| So this area has been zoned for R1 for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| I'm surprised it wasn't developed before now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| And I've had a problem advocating a postponement also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3329)|
| 0:55:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3339)|
| 0:55:40| Mr. Carey, what are the concerns specifically of the neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| I mean, we always hear traffic and that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| But, you know, what are the real concerns here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| Delaying it for another 30 days, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| I'm not sure anything is going to get much resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| So convince me that we need to delay this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| A couple of things, first of all, is that it was mentioned that the zoning around it is all R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| The overwhelming borderline zoning on the south side of this development and on the east side is EN2, a very unique zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3364)|
| 0:56:13| the only zone in Knoxville this district possesses, and it's for broad lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3373)|
| 0:56:19| The Bonneman lot is 336 feet wide, backing up to like four 79-foot lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3379)|
| 0:56:24| All those lots on the back side are large, wide lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| And on the east side, again, EN2, not R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| So are these compatible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| Totally different neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| Our neighborhood was never graded in 1924.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| They scraped the topsoil off and built on the rolling topography there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| There's no cut and fill in old Westmoreland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| And so we have the 16-foot wide roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3404)|
| 0:56:49| We can't discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| We know that we can't make anything happen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| What I want you to look at on page CP04 in your plan is the cut banks that are against the borders on the east and west side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3412)|
| 0:57:03| and how steep they are, and what that's going to create is no way to buffer anything between those neighbors' boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3423)|
| 0:57:09| And we want to try to soften the impact on the three neighborhoods involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| That's our objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| And if we don't do it, if this gets passed today, we have no means to ever have any way to discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3434)|
| 0:57:23| Nothing would hold any changes in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| You know how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| So, again, part of it is the public faith in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| The sign placement, we know is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| Again, the bush, I don't understand why I was behind a bush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| It's a tiny little yellow dot, and it's a deciduous shrub, sure, but it was placed behind a bush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3460)|
| 0:57:46| It could have been moved three feet, four feet to the right and not been behind the bush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| But that being said, we hope there's a system that can allow us to at least sit down and listen to what might be done to buffer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3470)|
| 0:58:00| We want to voice our traffic concerns, see if the developer has anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| It's going to help us when a concrete truck comes up a 16-foot wide street and meets anything, somebody goes in the ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3484)|
| 0:58:12| I mean, it happens all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| That's not something we can enforce, but we are ready, willing, and able, not next week because of spring break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3495)|
| 0:58:22| but the following week to sit down and have a meaningful conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3502)|
| 0:58:27| Thank you. Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| Again, I agree with Pat, and Mr. Carey, I'm trying to figure out what 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3510)|
| 0:58:37| You said if this passes, you stand no chance of having any impact on this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3517)|
| 0:58:44| and it seems to me that if it's postponed, you have very little opportunity to impact this development either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3524)|
| 0:58:56| I don't think that anything you can say is going to change somebody that's engineered it seven ways to Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3536)|
| 0:59:03| Well, the eighth way might prevent all the trees being cut right up to the property line of the adjacent property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3543)|
| 0:59:11| And you might be right, but I'll look at the grade lines that you've asked us to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3551)|
| 0:59:18| and the Westmoreland, New Westmoreland, or whatever you want to call it, down on the corner of Westland and Morrell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3558)|
| 0:59:24| it's certainly cut down with a bank on the back sides of theirs that is done the same way, very done the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3564)|
| 0:59:33| Are you speaking on the west side of the development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| West side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| Opposite end of this, below the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| There's a cut bank below Westland Drive that was graded out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| And those lots sit down below grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| My point is I'm trying to figure out what 30 days buys us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| And other than everybody gets happy and warm and fuzzy and then mad 30 days from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3590)|
| 0:59:57| because they weren't able to change anything about the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| which the developer is asking for less density than he could ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3601)|
| 1:00:06| They've engineered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| We understand all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| Again, those boundaries specifically, well, I'll say all three boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3609)|
| 1:00:14| Some of those cut lines look like they're one-to-one slopes or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3614)|
| 1:00:19| They come right up to the adjacent property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| I'm not sure what the slope is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3621)|
| 1:00:22| Scratch that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3622)|
| 1:00:23| I'm not going to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| That's guesswork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| But the point is that they haven't created any boundaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| and we would like to sit down and see what we can do to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3629)|
| 1:00:34| The eighth way to engineer this might be the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| At least it gives us hope that we might be able to save some of these neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3638)|
| 1:00:45| from looking straight at an industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| So that's as specific as I can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3649)|
| 1:00:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| I have a question for Mr. Bretzko and Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| Even though the applicant did not request any waivers in terms of roadway width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| or right-of-way width, is that still within our purview at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| Could we grant those, hopefully helping some of the setbacks along peripheral boundaries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3669)|
| 1:01:16| Because it is in a hillside area, the applicants could request that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3676)|
| 1:01:20| We would need the approval from the city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| They would have to accept the reduced right-of-way and reduced pavement width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| But this commission, upon their acceptance of the city engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| this commission could grant that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| Could we make that part of a motion if the motion to postpone failed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| Could we make that part of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| Subject to the approval by city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| And the desire of the applicant to reduce their pavement width and their right-of-way width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3703)|
| 1:01:51| And just to add briefly on that, I think that having a condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3711)|
| 1:01:56| if you were to add a condition stating that subject to the applicant working with engineering staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3716)|
| 1:02:04| and planning staff to look at reducing the pavement and right-of-way width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3724)|
| 1:02:10| and to modify the grading plan as much as possible to protect the existing trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3730)|
| 1:02:17| I mean, it's something we can work with them during that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| I don't know it's necessarily a needed condition, but it wouldn't hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3740)|
| 1:02:24| Apparently, there are not very many mature trees on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| based on what the applicant has indicated or the engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| I think he said it was on the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| I walked the property last night, and there's hundreds of 60-foot poplars, primarily mostly on the outside edges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3754)|
| 1:02:43| but all throughout the property that's wooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| The center line, Gordon Bonneman landed an airplane on that property 40 years ago in the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3765)|
| 1:02:50| It was cleared then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3770)|
| 1:02:51| It's not now, and there's huge trees all around that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| What I'd like to say on record is that we're not so interested in reducing the pavement width from 26 to 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3775)|
| 1:03:03| I sat on the hillside task force, and the primary objective of that was, yes, to reduce runoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3783)|
| 1:03:08| but primarily when you have a switchback not to make it so big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3788)|
| 1:03:11| There's no switchback in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| It's a straight shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| It's a thermometer down the middle with the cul-de-sac at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| We don't have a huge interest in that, but only if it might reduce runoff a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| That's not going to help meet what the intention of that objective was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3803)|
| 1:03:28| Thank you. Commissioner Boyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| Mr. Mullins, right now I've heard a lot from my fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| and it seems to me all of them make very good sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3815)|
| 1:03:41| My concern is you started, when you presented to us, stating that you had spent a full year on this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3821)|
| 1:03:50| and that a lot of time and energy had gone into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| and then when you were asked about reaching out to the communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3833)|
| 1:03:58| your statement was that two residents in the community who were fellow attorneys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| had brought up some of the concerns that neighbors had reached out to them regarding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3843)|
| 1:04:09| and that seemed to be the first time that there was communication between both parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3849)|
| 1:04:18| wherein they were reaching out to you, and it didn't go the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3858)|
| 1:04:25| So I'm an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| I feel like if you have followed all the guidelines, and I look to one hand and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3866)|
| 1:04:33| these are the rules, and really this body, this is what we should do is operate within the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| But then on the other hand, I feel like there is great value in that good faith planning to bring in the communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3878)|
| 1:04:46| especially long established communities who care strongly, and obviously by here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3886)|
| 1:04:54| So I'm not sure which way the vote is going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| I'm not a prognosticator, but I guess my statement would be that no matter the outcome of the vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3897)|
| 1:05:04| that you would take it upon yourself and your parties to make every effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3904)|
| 1:05:14| If it does go in your way that there is no postponement, that you would treat this as if there had been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3914)|
| 1:05:19| and that you would go forward with the communities and really see to it that there is a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3919)|
| 1:05:26| at least that people are heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3926)|
| 1:05:30| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| I have told my clients that, yes, we need to continue to work with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| because one of the concerns that was raised to me and Russ here individually after the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3934)|
| 1:05:41| was the concern about what's it going to be like when there's construction going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3941)|
| 1:05:45| I can understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| No one wants construction in their backyard, but that's inevitable for any development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| And to continue to work with them to minimize that impact as things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3950)|
| 1:05:54| make sure they're not parking on the street and blocking the right of way, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3954)|
| 1:05:58| Those are things that we will continue to work with them, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| And we don't want a development that's not going to be something that someone will want to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3961)|
| 1:06:09| and move into and live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| And so a lot of the concerns they're raising with regard to the slope, with regard to the buffering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| we want to preserve that as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| There's no reason why we wouldn't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3981)|
| 1:06:22| But here's what I'm going to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3982)|
| 1:06:23| I think the one word that capsulizes everything that's been happening this last however long is the word surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3983)|
| 1:06:32| Nobody likes surprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| Where you live, your home, your family, you know, a great large asset of your wealth, just surprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=3994)|
| 1:06:41| Nobody likes surprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| And of all the things you would want us to work on in this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| us battling this between a developer and the communication with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| you would love us probably to work on other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| And that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4015)|
| 1:06:56| And, you know, we were reached out to by some neighbors early on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| And, you know, we didn't know how many people knew about it or how many people cared about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4020)|
| 1:07:04| We couldn't look into the minds of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4024)|
| 1:07:07| And when you talk about surprise, we don't like surprises as developers either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4027)|
| 1:07:11| And that's why we try to follow the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| And we've done that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| We've followed every rule that is before us to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| Maybe as fellow attorneys we just know we need to go over and beyond, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| We should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4042)|
| 1:07:23| And mediate that for a successful resolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| So we don't like judges making decisions for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| We like us to work them out with our clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| And so that's just it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| I've beat that horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4053)|
| 1:07:34| If I could say one more quick thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| There was a mention about the zoning not being all R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| I think the EN1 was passed sometime late 2008, 2010, that area, to prevent large subdivisions from going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4060)|
| 1:07:47| But before that, all of this area was zoned R1, the same as this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| So it's consistent from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| Thanks, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4073)|
| 1:07:54| We have one more light on, and then we're going to go to the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| Commissioner Goodwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4077)|
| 1:07:58| My concern about all of this is not so much the legalities because I think they've followed all the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4078)|
| 1:08:05| It has been my long-term concern while sitting on six-plus years on this commission that neighbors need to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4085)|
| 1:08:15| And even if it's a 30-day postponement, at least if they get to communicate with the developers and their attorneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4095)|
| 1:08:23| they're going to feel better about it even if they lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| And I think it's really important for the communities, the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4107)|
| 1:08:32| whether they're adjacent or several hundred feet away, to have a voice and to be able to express their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4112)|
| 1:08:41| So that's where I am on this and agree with several of my fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4121)|
| 1:08:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| We do have a motion on the table by Commissioner Graf to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4127)|
| 1:08:52| That was seconded by Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| I see no more lights on, and so we are going to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| All in favor of a postponement of 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| And any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| I believe the ayes carry it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| So this is postponed for 30 days, and thank you to the community for reaching out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4153)|
| 1:09:19| I would like to say one thing is that when you're sending e-mails, because this is going to come before us again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4159)|
| 1:09:29| when you're sending e-mails, make sure that the e-mail is something original, not original content,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| but don't just copy and paste what other people have sent, because the problem is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| is when we start reading and we read the first few lines that is a copy and paste of the last 10 e-mails that we got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4179)|
| 1:09:46| if there's something unique that you say at the bottom, we usually miss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| So if you are sending e-mails, you know, let the chair of your HOA send one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4190)|
| 1:09:58| and then you can add your own comments and thoughts to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| But just to copy the same e-mail is not real productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| So thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| Madam Chair, I'll read it as reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4207)|
| 1:10:13| We have just a few minutes while the room clears before we go on to our next agenda item, which is agenda item number 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4213)|
| 1:10:20| 13 and 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| 14 and 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| 13?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| 13 and 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4226)|
| 1:10:27| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4227)|
| 1:10:28| 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4228)|
| 1:10:29| You have been really bad today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4229)|
| 1:10:59| I don't think I'm going to need that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| But we'll have a lot of free time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4261)|
| 1:11:05| Years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4266)|
| 1:11:07| People are going to need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| I've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4268)|
| 1:11:09| He still is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| Indirectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| He's a baby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4271)|
| 1:11:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4272)|
| 1:11:13| Mine, my sister.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| He can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| Which?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4278)|
| 1:11:19| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| I don't think one of the thoughts is going to change my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4280)|
| 1:11:28| Well, no, I'm kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4288)|
| 1:11:35| Gerald is the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4295)|
| 1:11:50| It was Jeff and Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4310)|
| 1:12:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| Seems like the room is cleared and we're going to go ahead and continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| If the commissioners can return to their seat, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4334)|
| 1:12:19| If you recall earlier in the meeting, we did move agenda item number 34 up to be heard at the same time as agenda 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4339)|
| 1:12:28| I will read both of these before we go into any discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4348)|
| 1:12:35| Agenda item number 14 is a subdivision report, a final subdivision report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4355)|
| 1:12:42| The subdivision is Coddington Court, resubdivision of lot 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4362)|
| 1:12:48| The applicant developer is Michael Brady, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4368)|
| 1:12:52| The location is the north side of north, south North Shore Drive, southwest side of Coddington Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4372)|
| 1:13:00| Approximate acreage is two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| The number of lots is four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| The zoning is PR planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| There are no variances required, and the staff recommendation is to deny the final plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4389)|
| 1:13:15| The plat does not comply with section 3.02A.1C of the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4395)|
| 1:13:25| Also, the agenda item number 34 is a use on review report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4405)|
| 1:13:31| The applicant is Michael Brady, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| The location is the northwest side of south North Shore Drive, southwest side of Coddington Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4414)|
| 1:13:41| Approximate size of the tract is two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4421)|
| 1:13:45| Zoning is PR planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| Existing land use is residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| Proposed use is detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4431)|
| 1:13:55| Staff recommendation is to deny the use on review request and proposed development plan for the reasons identified below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4435)|
| 1:14:03| Before we call on the applicant and any opposition, Mr. Breschke, would you like to say anything about these two agenda items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4443)|
| 1:14:13| Madam Chair, this piece of property that's being proposed to be subdivided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4453)|
| 1:14:19| was originally shown on the subdivision plat for Coddington Court as a single lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4459)|
| 1:14:27| and the northern portion has a closed contour sinkhole, and it was identified on that plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4467)|
| 1:14:35| They're proposing to create the three additional lots out of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| and the three new lots are in the area of the identified sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| One of the requirements of subdivision regulations is that you have to have buildable area outside of the sinkhole designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4484)|
| 1:14:51| and the required setbacks for that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| Based on what was provided to staff, there is nothing that identifies that there is a buildable area on those three lots outside of those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4496)|
| 1:15:04| and it was based on that that staff recommended denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4504)|
| 1:15:10| We initially had a geotech analysis that was done with this when the subdivision was originally done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4510)|
| 1:15:17| With the application that was submitted, there was a new analysis done and provided with that plan identifying that it was their opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4517)|
| 1:15:24| they did not think this was a sinkhole feature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| There's documentation that was provided by another geotechnical engineer that they feel that it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4528)|
| 1:15:37| and to try to resolve some of this issue, Knox County requested that their geotech engineer look at all the data that's been submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4537)|
| 1:15:47| from the different reports and make a recommendation, and that was included in your package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4547)|
| 1:15:53| along with all the other reports, previous reports was in the initial package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4553)|
| 1:15:59| And it was their opinion that, based on what they've looked at from all these analyses, that they feel this is a sinkhole feature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4559)|
| 1:16:07| and think it is not in the best interest to further develop that portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4567)|
| 1:16:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4578)|
| 1:16:19| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4583)|
| 1:16:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4585)|
| 1:16:26| Do you want to go first, sir, or the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| No, we'll pass to the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| We've got two on the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| Yes, John King, 620 Market Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4598)|
| 1:16:43| Mr. King, we can't hear unless you speak into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4603)|

| 1:16:48| John King, 620 Market Street, Knoxville, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4608)|
| 1:16:58| I was hired by two individuals to speak on this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4618)|
| 1:17:04| and the Homeowners Association has a representative here who would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4624)|
| 1:17:12| I can speak for myself, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| I'm Ron German.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4634)|
| 1:17:15| I'm president of the EJO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| Excuse me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| Excuse me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| Mr. King had the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| Mr. King, are you going to split your time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| We have no agreement on sharing time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| I just wanted to alert the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4646)|
| 1:17:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4651)|
| 1:17:32| So, in other words, who's speaking on opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4655)|
| 1:17:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4656)|
| 1:17:37| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4657)|
| 1:17:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4658)|
| 1:17:39| You both have five minutes if you care to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| No, not you both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4661)|
| 1:17:42| You have five minutes together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| So if you would like to allow each other to be considerate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| and allow each other to speak, then that would be wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| So I know that we'd like to hear from both of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4675)|
| 1:17:56| You ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4676)|
| 1:17:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4677)|
| 1:17:58| Well, Tom stole a lot of my thunder, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| Ron German, 9108 British Station Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4680)|
| 1:18:04| As the president of the Coddington Court Homeowners Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4684)|
| 1:18:08| I represent all 24 of your neighbors, folks that you know, Dale Kiesling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4688)|
| 1:18:14| Pam Pansler, Buddy Carroll, Nancy Sherwood, Wilson Ritchie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4694)|
| 1:18:20| We unanimously are opposed to this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| You've got a lot of documents, as Tom said, in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| so let me just summarize the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| Before our subdivision was built, two reputable engineering firms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| Fulham McIndoe and S&ME, surveyed this lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| and reported a 200-foot wide sinkhole and recommended not to build on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4718)|
| 1:18:44| In 2006, another reputable company, Benchmark, prepared a plot map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4724)|
| 1:18:50| which MPC approved, showing the same sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4730)|
| 1:18:54| Our HOA recently hired a fourth company, Shields Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| who reviewed historical documents, the Fulham McIndoe and S&ME's findings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4739)|
| 1:19:04| and the report of the applicant's engineering firm and came to the same conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4744)|
| 1:19:10| This lot has, indeed, a huge sinkhole and that the lot, therefore, is not buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4750)|
| 1:19:15| This year, as Tom said, at the request of the Knox County Engineering Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4755)|
| 1:19:20| Mr. Dan Bowles of S&ME reviewed all of these documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4760)|
| 1:19:24| and that of the applicant's engineering report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| He also concluded that this closed depression is, in fact, a sinkhole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4767)|
| 1:19:32| and that development of the site places risk on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| in addition to that of the adjacent ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| Now, recently we've had a lot of heavy rain in the last few weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4778)|
| 1:19:43| and our homeowners experienced these loud, audible booms in our homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4783)|
| 1:19:48| and strong vibrations that shook our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| As you can imagine, it greatly concerned us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| So we hired Shield Engineering for an opinion as to what might be causing these tremors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4796)|
| 1:20:01| They believe that these events are related to dome collapses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| of both soil and or rock beneath the ground in cave systems developed by the sinkhole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4805)|
| 1:20:11| confirming again that this lot is, indeed, a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4811)|
| 1:20:15| Finally, upon review of all of these reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| you heard Tom say that MPC staff recommend the denial of the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4818)|
| 1:20:22| because it does not comply with 3.02A.1C of the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4822)|
| 1:20:29| So in summary, five highly respected engineering companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4829)|
| 1:20:35| and the MPC staff have acknowledged this lot as having a huge sinkhole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| and therefore not buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| The applicant has one report whose soil sampling method is suspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4842)|
| 1:20:47| and his own report states it is our professional opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4847)|
| 1:20:52| that the development of this site could possibly present geotechnical challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4852)|
| 1:20:57| We believe it is irresponsible for the applicant to build over a million tons of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4857)|
| 1:21:03| over a designated sinkhole, that excavation of the sinkhole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| will most likely have a negative effect on the adjoining properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| and it will clearly result in a devaluation of all properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4871)|
| 1:21:16| We ask that you deny the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| Mr. King, you have one minute, ten seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| Would you like to use that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4883)|
| 1:21:43| Before you start my time run, I've got some material I'd like to submit for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4903)|
| 1:21:51| and I will give each one of you a copy of what we're submitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4911)|
| 1:21:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| The first packet includes a letter with attached materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4918)|
| 1:22:04| stated 12.3.18 to this commission from Mr. German.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4924)|
| 1:22:13| The second packet starts with a letter from Ray Tant, SHIELD Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4933)|
| 1:22:21| to Bill Jenkins dated 12.3.78.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4941)|
| 1:22:27| I represent Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Wilson Ritchie, both of whom are property owners there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4947)|
| 1:22:33| Mr. Jenkins' house slightly and just a little bit into the buffer for the sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4953)|
| 1:22:53| The third thing is a letter from me dated yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4973)|
| 1:23:00| All of these documents are dated to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4980)|
| 1:23:04| and I've been told that you all have the report from S&ME that was requested by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4984)|
| 1:23:18| Mr. King, the time is up for the oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| See, I told you I'd start running while I was passing the stuff out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5001)|
| 1:23:24| Madam Chair, if we could get another two minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| Another two minutes will be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5008)|
| 1:23:40| The applicant seeks your approval to build and develop lots on land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5020)|
| 1:23:47| within the confines of a 200-foot diameter sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5027)|
| 1:23:54| On the basis of the expert evaluation, including our own from SHIELD Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5034)|
| 1:23:59| and that of County Engineering's independent expert from S&ME,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5039)|
| 1:24:06| supported by well-documented quantitative data along with other investigative results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5046)|
| 1:24:13| supporting their evaluations, we submit, as they clearly state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5053)|
| 1:24:21| this sinkhole should not be built on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| We, along with your staff, seek denial of this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5065)|
| 1:24:29| We've submitted a lot of material and you've seen a lot of material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5069)|
| 1:24:35| Our letter talks about the relevant things to look at as you're looking at this particular matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5075)|
| 1:24:41| If you look at the very back of packet number one, there are some color photographs there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5081)|
| 1:24:48| That's of a failure, a collapse of a sinkhole on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5088)|
| 1:24:58| say on the same property where the current sinkhole is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5098)|
| 1:25:03| That collapse resulted in a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5103)|
| 1:25:07| The county ended up expending funds to stabilize that situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5107)|
| 1:25:14| and there's all sorts of explanations as to how that occurred and how it came to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5114)|
| 1:25:19| that they were trying to build on that particular lot where that sinkhole opened up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5119)|
| 1:25:32| Originally, this subdivision was planned for 25 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5132)|
| 1:25:39| It was built for 25 lots with one hiccup, and that was the other collapse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5139)|
| 1:25:46| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| Please stay by because I know that Commissioner is going to have some questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5148)|
| 1:25:53| but I think that what we'd like to hear from is the applicant at this time, but don't go far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| I won't be far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5158)|
| 1:26:09| Yes, sir. Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5169)|
| 1:26:11| My name is Brent Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5171)|
| 1:26:12| I'm with Hearts and Construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| My address is 809 Crestwell Court, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5175)|
| 1:26:23| We've addressed this issue one other time, and then there's been several postponements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5183)|
| 1:26:27| and I think they've mostly been postponements requested by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5187)|
| 1:26:33| We did what was asked of us when we bought this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5193)|
| 1:26:37| and we had a geotechnical report done by GeoServices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5197)|
| 1:26:43| GeoServices is the only company, only engineering firm that's gone out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5203)|
| 1:26:48| and drilled holes and taken soil samples and studied those soil samples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5208)|
| 1:26:54| They are the people who have the most knowledge regarding this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5214)|
| 1:26:59| and whether there is an active sinkhole on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5219)|
| 1:27:03| Their opinion is the closed depression on the property is not the result of an active sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5223)|
| 1:27:10| When there was a note placed on this plat that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5230)|
| 1:27:15| buyer beware, it should have said, buyer beware if you have any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5235)|
| 1:27:20| hire S&ME or Shields Engineering to do your study for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5240)|
| 1:27:25| because if you go out and hire GeoServices, then you're not going to be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5245)|
| 1:27:31| because then there will be a difference of opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| GeoServices is a qualified engineering firm to give their opinion regarding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5254)|
| 1:27:40| They did the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| All we have is people sitting in the stands criticizing the players out on the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5262)|
| 1:27:50| We've done what's asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| Ross Kingery is here today with Geo to answer any of your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5272)|
| 1:28:00| What we were told was to have the report done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5280)|
| 1:28:03| that the foundations must be designed by a competent, licensed professional engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5283)|
| 1:28:08| including field observation and monitoring during construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5288)|
| 1:28:13| We've said before we will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| That's what was asked of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| What we've done is appropriate and correct, and now there is a difference of opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5297)|
| 1:28:24| and you've been asked arbitrarily to accept the opinion of one engineering firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5304)|
| 1:28:29| over another engineering firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5309)|
| 1:28:32| As I said, the engineering firm, GeoServices, has more knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5312)|
| 1:28:36| They've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| They did the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| So I'll turn the rest of my time over to Mr. Kingery for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5320)|
| 1:28:49| Ross Kingery, GeoServices, 2561 Willow Point Way, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5329)|
| 1:28:59| I'm not sure we're at the point of having questions, but I don't go far, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5339)|
| 1:29:09| Oh, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5349)|
| 1:29:10| Yes, I do have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| In 2004, the original geotechnical report performed by S&ME was done by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5352)|
| 1:29:17| At that time, TDEC had an ordinance that stated you couldn't build within a closed depression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5357)|
| 1:29:23| Since that time, TDEC has removed that rule regarding construction within closed depressions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5363)|
| 1:29:30| and the only rule now is that you can't discharge water into a closed depression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5370)|
| 1:29:36| So now, fast forward 10 years later, we went out and did additional soil test borings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5376)|
| 1:29:42| to supplement the original geotechnical exploration that was performed by S&ME in 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5382)|
| 1:29:48| The soil profile within the soil test borings states firm to stiff to depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5388)|
| 1:29:55| There's not a decrease in strength with depth on both borings performed within a depression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5395)|
| 1:30:03| Our firm performed an additional five borings within the closed depression,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5403)|
| 1:30:09| and our data is very similar, firm to stiff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5409)|
| 1:30:13| Although there is risk of sinkhole activity at any site in West Knoxville or any site within this geology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5413)|
| 1:30:19| we now have a significant amount of data that we can engineer upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5419)|
| 1:30:25| We don't feel that the risk on building on this lot is any greater than the neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5425)|
| 1:30:30| the subdivision down the street, or any neighborhood in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5430)|
| 1:30:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| I would like to call on county engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5439)|
| 1:30:43| Are you familiar with this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| I know that the original study, they set aside that area because they said it was prone to sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5445)|
| 1:30:56| The developer hired an engineer to bought the property, hired a geotechnical firm to do the studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5456)|
| 1:31:02| and then after that, both Tant Engineering and S&ME, we looked at that data at the request of county engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5462)|
| 1:31:14| We don't have any geotechnical engineers on staff, but one of the contractors for the county looked at the studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5474)|
| 1:31:23| and he thought that it was due to sinkhole activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5483)|
| 1:31:29| Also, there's been past sinkhole activity within that subdivision, so we're in agreement with the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5489)|
| 1:31:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| Yes, the engineer for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| Have you seen that picture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5506)|
| 1:31:51| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| Mr. King, is that a picture of a sinkhole that's on this same property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5513)|
| 1:32:00| Can I respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5525)|
| 1:32:06| It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5526)|
| 1:32:07| It is lot 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5527)|
| 1:32:08| My property adjoins lot 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| That lot is across the street from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| Is it in the same development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| It's in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5536)|
| 1:32:17| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5537)|
| 1:32:18| Can I add to that sinkhole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5538)|
| 1:32:19| There's more to that story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| The same geotech individual, Mr. Huckabee, who works with geotech, is the same individual back in 2004 who said to the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5541)|
| 1:32:31| it's okay to build on lot 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| That's not a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5554)|
| 1:32:35| It's a depression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5555)|
| 1:32:36| And then a couple of years later, after the house was built, it started falling into a 40-foot sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5556)|
| 1:32:42| He was wrong then, and he's wrong now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5564)|
| 1:32:45| That's all I needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| Here's my thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5567)|
| 1:32:51| I know there are sinkholes everywhere in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| You can't sling a dead cat without hitting one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| But if it looks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, I'm really having a hard time thinking that right down the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5578)|
| 1:33:06| just because you filled that one, you didn't do some damage to the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5586)|
| 1:33:10| So I'm going to make a motion that we deny the final plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy to deny the final plat, seconded by Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5594)|
| 1:33:19| Before we go to a vote, we do have some other lights on, and we're going to go to Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5599)|
| 1:33:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5605)|
| 1:33:26| And maybe this is for the county or the opposition's engineer if they have one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5606)|
| 1:33:31| But as I read the opposition's report, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| there's comment in the report that says that it presents a greater, I guess, possibility of failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5615)|
| 1:33:45| When I try to frame a problem, I want to know the likelihood or how big the problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5625)|
| 1:33:50| How big is greater on this site versus any other site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5630)|
| 1:33:55| I can't speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5635)|
| 1:33:56| Mr. Tant wasn't able to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| I think you're referring to the SHIELD report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| Comments from S&ME, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5642)|
| 1:34:07| This is a letter from S&ME to Jim Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| Oh, that was done by the county engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| You might want to ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5652)|
| 1:34:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5653)|
| 1:34:14| So since we have risk everywhere, you know, I don't know if you can put it on a number scale or just tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5654)|
| 1:34:24| It seems like a broad comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| What does greater mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5666)|
| 1:34:27| Yeah, well, I don't really feel comfortable speaking for the geotechnical engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| The person who prepared that report has a contract with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5671)|
| 1:34:36| Like, you know, when sinkholes like on Greenwell Road appear, you know, they're under contract with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5676)|
| 1:34:43| So it was his opinion that the depression was due to karst activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5683)|
| 1:34:48| So we have to go with, you know, that opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5688)|
| 1:34:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5691)|
| 1:34:52| I respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5692)|
| 1:34:53| But we have another one that says that it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| So, you know, I always thought engineering was more of a science than a practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5696)|
| 1:35:00| but I guess it's more of a practice than a science because now I go to the other report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5700)|
| 1:35:06| and it says not only is it not, let's see, a sinkhole, it reduces, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5706)|
| 1:35:18| the ability for the area to fail because it has been filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5718)|
| 1:35:22| And I'd like for Mr. Kingery to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| Let me try to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5725)|
| 1:35:26| It says somewhat decreases the risk of sinkhole development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5726)|
| 1:35:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5730)|
| 1:35:31| Fill material is essentially creating an impervious blanket across the surface of bedrock or the soil overburden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5731)|
| 1:35:38| Anytime you reduce the permeability of the soil above bedrock, it reduces the risk of sinkhole activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5738)|
| 1:35:46| Like we said before, the historical photographs indicate that this was possibly a pond at some point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5746)|
| 1:35:52| and it was a dairy or some farming operation beside it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5752)|
| 1:36:00| To my knowledge, since the site was developed in 2005-2006, this area hasn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5760)|
| 1:36:07| We've seen 40 inches of rain in the last six months, unseasonably wet weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5767)|
| 1:36:13| The ground hasn't subsided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| Nothing's changed on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| We also have additional data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5778)|
| 1:36:19| The only data that we have is the data from S&ME in 2004 and the data from our firm in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5779)|
| 1:36:28| We have a ton of data here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| Would you feel more comfortable building a house or engineering a footing where you have a lot of data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5790)|
| 1:36:36| or do we just take the risk of building anywhere in the same geology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| where we have no clue what's going on below the ground surface?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5799)|
| 1:36:44| This sinkhole on Greenwell Road, was it a depression there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5807)|
| 1:36:48| It was in the middle of the road in a high spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| It just happens, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5810)|
| 1:36:53| Here we have a lot of data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| We feel comfortable with what's below grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5815)|
| 1:36:59| It's the risk we're taking and the risk the developer's taking to proceed forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| He's willing to invest to remediate anything below grade, design footings that will span, and I just don't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5824)|
| 1:37:17| We've got all the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5837)|
| 1:37:19| SHIELD is an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5839)|
| 1:37:21| S&ME is just an opinion, and it's an opinion that they had 14 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5841)|
| 1:37:25| Times have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| The county had an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5847)|
| 1:37:28| You can't build within a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| You've never been able to argue that, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| If TDEC will allow you to do so, if you hire a geotechnical engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5853)|
| 1:37:37| why don't you allow a geotechnical engineer to design the foundations for these homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5857)|
| 1:37:42| and let the builder build the house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5865)|
| 1:37:47| Yeah, I just wanted to ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| Could I follow up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5869)|
| 1:37:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5870)|
| 1:37:51| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5871)|
| 1:37:52| Yeah, I just wanted to follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5872)|
| 1:37:53| To Mr. Watson's point, I just want to bring to light that Mr. Kingery's firm was the only one that drilled this site is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5873)|
| 1:38:05| They have more information than anybody, and they're willing to put their stamp saying this is not a sinkhole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5885)|
| 1:38:12| and to me that speaks volumes, and for that I can't support denying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5892)|
| 1:38:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5897)|
| 1:38:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5899)|
| 1:38:20| Just a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| There's a 1985 historic aerial that does show that there was a big pond there, it looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| on an old black-and-white aerial if you want to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| But moreover than that, to me, I know Mr. Kingery and his firm, GEOS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5909)|
| 1:38:34| and I know they're all good firms, very reputable, they do a good job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5914)|
| 1:38:39| and I don't think we need to be guessing about which engineering firm did the right report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5919)|
| 1:38:45| On the final plat that was recorded on this subdivision, it addresses this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5925)|
| 1:38:49| and it basically says that no building shall take place unless the county approves an engineering report submitted as to the sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5929)|
| 1:39:01| And the issue to me is with the applicant and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| I mean, if the county does not approve it, it says it right on the old plat, the plat that's in place now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5945)|
| 1:39:11| and it just says Knox County Engineering and Public Works must approve a report done by a geotechnical engineer to build in the sinkhole area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5951)|
| 1:39:21| So the county, I mean, if you guys don't approve it, it can't be built on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5961)|
| 1:39:27| And so that's kind of where I think we will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5967)|
| 1:39:35| Yeah, well, we asked our consultant, we asked them to take a look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5975)|
| 1:39:40| and it was their opinion it was a sinkhole, and we are relying on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5980)|
| 1:39:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| I mean, it's hard for us to read through four different engineering reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5986)|
| 1:39:50| and we don't want to make a mistake, but we don't know what's there underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5990)|
| 1:39:55| So we have to rely on Knox County, and it's hard to go against them on that, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=5995)|
| 1:40:02| The original study was done by an engineer who was with S&ME at the time, said it was a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6002)|
| 1:40:11| Now he's with GEOS, and he says it's not a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6011)|
| 1:40:14| Well, I know Ross, and I just want to make sure he knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6014)|
| 1:40:18| We have confidence in what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6018)|
| 1:40:20| I'm not saying they're doing anything wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6020)|
| 1:40:22| but the link to all this is through Knox County's engineering department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| and if they don't say, yes, we can remove this sinkhole buffer and you can build here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6025)|
| 1:40:29| then I don't think we are allowed to let them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6029)|
| 1:40:32| Mr. Freshcoat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| Just on the final plot that identified the sinkhole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| that wording in there talks about building within the area around the closed depression or sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6038)|
| 1:40:44| Basically, the geotech analysis was done to determine in the 50-foot buffer that we have required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6044)|
| 1:40:50| around closed contours, if they can build within it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6050)|
| 1:40:53| But, again, in our recommendations and conditions in the past, that would allow building around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6053)|
| 1:40:59| but within the closed contour and the five-foot easement around that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6059)|
| 1:41:03| we have not recommended or allowed any building construction in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6063)|
| 1:41:10| And I think Leo can support that, because it always deals with the area around the sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6070)|
| 1:41:16| And that's in our ordinance, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6076)|
| 1:41:20| Okay. Good. Commissioner Rutan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6080)|
| 1:41:25| Mr. Kingery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| I'm looking at the original boring log map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6090)|
| 1:41:38| Looked to me like somebody drilled in the very center of the sinkhole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6098)|
| 1:41:45| going towards the lower end of the sinkhole, the bottom elevation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6105)|
| 1:41:50| and it looked like another hole was pushed somewhere up the upper three-quarters of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6110)|
| 1:41:57| There were two of them down in this one particular area, and you said that you did four or five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6117)|
| 1:42:02| Where's your boring log map in reference to this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6122)|
| 1:42:08| How close were you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| Very close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| We did five within this inside the depressed area, or so-called depressed area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6132)|
| 1:42:17| You know, today it's flat since it's been filled in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6137)|
| 1:42:21| There's no indication of any sinkhole or subsidence on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| So there were five borings done in that general area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6144)|
| 1:42:29| And I'm assuming your firm reviewed the 2004 drilling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6149)|
| 1:42:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6156)|
| 1:42:39| Did you learn anything from that drilling in difference to, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6159)|
| 1:42:43| you could, in theory, drill 20 different spots and maybe hit something different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6163)|
| 1:42:47| Yeah. I mean, it just goes back to the way the ordinance was or how the ordinance is written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6167)|
| 1:42:52| If you can't build within a closed contour depression,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6172)|
| 1:42:55| why would you spend engineering time to look at it if you couldn't do it to begin with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6175)|
| 1:42:59| It wasn't an option then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| But now, fast forward 10 years later, TDEC, they don't care what you do with a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6181)|
| 1:43:06| Hire a geotechnical engineer. Hire an expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| Let them tell you what you're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| They're concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| The only reason why the ordinance was put the way it was is so people aren't discharging stormwater into them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6192)|
| 1:43:17| They don't want you to alter the drainage going into it without an injection well permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6197)|
| 1:43:24| The only way to alter that was to get an injection well permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| What would an injection well permit do for filling it in or building a house on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6208)|
| 1:43:33| We're not trying to inject water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| We're wanting to engineer the footings for this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6216)|
| 1:43:41| And, again, the risk is no different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| I mean, what about the neighbors, the subdivisions down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6224)|
| 1:43:48| I mean, they have no information on those houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6228)|
| 1:43:51| We've got eight soil test borings in this area, in a very small area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6231)|
| 1:43:56| We know it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6236)|
| 1:43:59| I'm almost with Mr. Smith on this with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6239)|
| 1:44:02| But, hey, Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6242)|
| 1:44:14| You hadn't been put on the spot today, so we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| Jim Snowden, 205 West Baxter Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| So I'm assuming that when we have a case like this that your office has to do a thumbs-up or thumbs-down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6261)|
| 1:44:29| It's incumbent upon the person that's submitting the information to give you as much information as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6269)|
| 1:44:36| to make you feel comfortable that they've exhausted whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6276)|
| 1:44:39| So the five or seven or eight soil borings that Ross's firm did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6279)|
| 1:44:46| would there be anything else that they could do that they'd stop short of doing to get to you or S&ME?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6286)|
| 1:44:55| Could they have excavated the lot and tried to do more subsurface exploration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6295)|
| 1:45:03| I mean, obviously, drilling is pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6303)|
| 1:45:07| Was there anything that your consultant recommended that they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6307)|
| 1:45:11| or was it just easier to say no when there's just too much risk and there's no reason to say yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6311)|
| 1:45:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6317)|
| 1:45:18| And we did give it a real good look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| I mean, we realized there's points on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| Because I remember one of the borings that was outside the closed depression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6322)|
| 1:45:28| had some of the worst or the softest soils near bedrock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6328)|
| 1:45:32| So there was a lot of diversity even amongst the borings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6332)|
| 1:45:38| From our perspective, that's why we brought S&ME in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6338)|
| 1:45:40| because Leo or I or nobody on our staff has that expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6340)|
| 1:45:44| because the borings could be interpreted different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| And based on S&ME's analysis of both, we provided them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6348)|
| 1:45:54| GEOS's report, Mr. Tant's analysis of the GEOS and the S&ME 2004 report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6354)|
| 1:46:02| based on a series of those conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6362)|
| 1:46:06| we felt like the risk was higher in this location for a sinkhole than some other areas adjoining it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6366)|
| 1:46:15| Now, whether or not to say there would ever be a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6375)|
| 1:46:17| I'm sure that GEOS could design and engineer foundations that would probably be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6377)|
| 1:46:23| But I think that the county's general perspective is this location does have some risks that are higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6383)|
| 1:46:28| than some other areas that have similar topography and geology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6388)|
| 1:46:35| So would they have the ability to design something to submit to you to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6395)|
| 1:46:43| or is it just we've said no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6403)|
| 1:46:50| That's a tough question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6410)|
| 1:46:51| I mean, I think if they were willing to, like Mr. Hill was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6411)|
| 1:46:57| if they want to put enough analysis into it and put an engineer stamp on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6417)|
| 1:47:03| where it would be their liability regarding the remediation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6423)|
| 1:47:08| or whatever they felt like would be the necessary foundations for the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6428)|
| 1:47:13| Because for the county, it's about managing risk for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6433)|
| 1:47:17| And from that perspective, I think if there was a stamp engineer's report of a foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6437)|
| 1:47:23| we would possibly consider approving that, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6446)|
| 1:47:27| So I'm going to be like Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| I would never vote for anything like this by myself just to vote yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6449)|
| 1:47:34| I would want somebody to give enough information to Mr. Snowden, and then they can work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6454)|
| 1:47:40| So whether this is approved or denied or postponed, I'd want Jim to tell me he's comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6460)|
| 1:47:46| And I have another question for you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| When you say that the engineering stamp and guarantee of liability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6469)|
| 1:47:53| does that guarantee a liability go to the homeowners so that if there's a sinkhole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6473)|
| 1:47:59| and there's damage to the home, that that's the engineering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6479)|
| 1:48:03| Is that where that carries to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6486)|
| 1:48:07| That liability would be on Mr. Kingery or whomever approved the footings for the home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6487)|
| 1:48:15| because he was stamping it with his professional license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| saying that that footing would support that home with the conditions that we have in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6498)|
| 1:48:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| Commissioner Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| I agree with Commissioner Hill, and I'm listening to, I'm hearing four or five reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6511)|
| 1:48:37| and what I'm hearing is that the company that did the soil borings and actually did the testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6517)|
| 1:48:45| are willing to do what they say they're going to do and willing to design something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6525)|
| 1:48:49| So what I'm also hearing is even if we approve this, if we vote to approve this today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6529)|
| 1:48:56| we're not approving them to proceed without the agreement of county engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6536)|
| 1:49:04| because everything has to be, I mean, every ruling that we make, there's usually a sentence in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6544)|
| 1:49:10| that would abide by county engineering's rules and by county engineering's specifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6550)|
| 1:49:16| I'm also hearing from county engineering that there's an ability for them to design footings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6556)|
| 1:49:23| and that might give them some level of comfort that these houses could be built within this closed depression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6563)|
| 1:49:30| or whatever you want to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6570)|
| 1:49:32| I'm not an expert in it, but I would be willing, I would give more weight to the company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6572)|
| 1:49:39| that actually did the testing than the company that took the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| and made an opinion off of the work someone else did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6581)|
| 1:49:46| Because I'm in the construction business, and I know that engineers disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6586)|
| 1:49:50| You may look at a, I'm in the steel business, you may look at a steel structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6590)|
| 1:49:53| and one engineer is saying it's over-designed or under-designed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6593)|
| 1:49:56| and you'll get two or three different ways to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6596)|
| 1:50:00| And every way may be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6600)|
| 1:50:04| It doesn't necessarily mean it's wrong on this side if one doesn't agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| So, I mean, I would be inclined to say that this body could approve this with the caveat in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6607)|
| 1:50:19| saying that they have to abide by county engineering standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| If county engineering says later that what they submit is not acceptable, then they can't build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6621)|
| 1:50:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6628)|
| 1:50:29| Mr. Fresco, is that not already in the conditions that it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6629)|
| 1:50:34| I'm hearing Commissioner Utena thinks that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6634)|
| 1:50:37| We have no conditions because we recommended denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6642)|
| 1:50:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6643)|
| 1:50:44| Along those lines, so if we approve this, and let me make sure I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6644)|
| 1:50:51| they would remove the sinkhole on the final plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6651)|
| 1:50:55| Is that what we're talking about, the drawing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6655)|
| 1:50:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6657)|
| 1:50:58| It would not show up, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6658)|
| 1:51:01| I mean, I just want to make sure, is that what we're?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6661)|
| 1:51:06| What I'm saying is if we approve this and somebody buys the lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6666)|
| 1:51:10| how are they going to know that there's an issue there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6670)|
| 1:51:14| I think we have to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6674)|
| 1:51:17| If we approve this, there has to be a caveat that county engineering has to approve the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6677)|
| 1:51:25| That's the only way we could proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6685)|
| 1:51:28| I'd like to hear from Director Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| I'll be willing to be corrected on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6690)|
| 1:51:34| What we would approve would be, what this board would approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6694)|
| 1:51:38| would be a new concept plan with the sinkhole identification removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6698)|
| 1:51:45| It would not show that there was ever a sinkhole there if you looked at the new plan, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6705)|
| 1:51:49| If you looked at the new plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6709)|
| 1:51:50| and then there would be a condition attached to the subdivision itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6710)|
| 1:51:55| that county engineering would have to approve foundations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6715)|
| 1:52:00| And I'll look to Mr. Snowden for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| The question I have, and I think that comes up, is if someone's looking at the plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6723)|
| 1:52:08| only for reference it's the plant, how would they know that condition exists?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6728)|
| 1:52:16| And I would imagine before a building, I'll try to speculate and Mr. Snowden may correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6736)|
| 1:52:21| but before a building permit were issued that there would be some notification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6741)|
| 1:52:26| that the engineering would have to be done prior to the issuance of the building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6746)|
| 1:52:31| But I'll let Mr. Snowden jump in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| Before he talks, just what I was going to say is I feel like there's a path to get this approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6754)|
| 1:52:39| I just feel like we may be halfway there from the applicant's perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6759)|
| 1:52:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6766)|
| 1:52:47| Mr. Smith, we actually have a note that we've used in similar locations like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6767)|
| 1:52:51| where we feel like it's a closed depression, but we're fairly confident, or we are confident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6771)|
| 1:52:57| that it's due to man-made conditions like a road was, you know, roadway field was placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6777)|
| 1:53:02| And essentially that note, and we can get you a copy of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6782)|
| 1:53:06| more or less advises the homeowner that there is a closed depression here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6786)|
| 1:53:12| and that there will be a footing design required by the engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6792)|
| 1:53:16| So there is precedent in our department to have a note of that kind of context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6796)|
| 1:53:22| I think there already was a note on the plat because we're considering 14,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6802)|
| 1:53:27| which is the final plat, and 34, which is the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6807)|
| 1:53:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6810)|
| 1:53:31| So I think we had a note on the plat already saying that they would have to have geotechnical, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6811)|
| 1:53:37| study done on the design of the footing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6817)|
| 1:53:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6821)|
| 1:53:42| Mr. Presko.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6822)|
| 1:53:44| Yeah, the final plat shows that area as a, you know, what was a closed depression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6824)|
| 1:53:52| It said the lots touched by shading fall within a previously identified closed depression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6832)|
| 1:53:57| These lots are underlain by limestone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| As are most other areas within Knox County, there's potential for sinkhole formation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6840)|
| 1:54:05| and subsidence of any site underlain by limestone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6845)|
| 1:54:11| Based on these concerns, the developer has obtained a detailed geotechnical data for each of these lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6851)|
| 1:54:18| This information is summarized in geoservices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6858)|
| 1:54:21| It refers to the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| In summary, the report indicates the closed depression is not the result of an active sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6863)|
| 1:54:28| However, the intent of this note is to make the buyer beware of this condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6868)|
| 1:54:33| The foundation of the lots within the shaded area must be designed by a competent licensed professional engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6873)|
| 1:54:39| including field observation and monitoring during construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6879)|
| 1:54:43| So the area shown on there, it's identified by this plat that it is not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6883)|
| 1:54:49| and just, you know, for sake of the final plat, you can't place conditions on the final plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6889)|
| 1:54:56| You either have to approve it or deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| It doesn't identify it as a sinkhole on here by the note they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6899)|
| 1:55:03| So it does require them to do basically the foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6903)|
| 1:55:09| I'm really uncomfortable about if we approve that any kind of indication would be removed from the plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6909)|
| 1:55:18| Why would we have to remove it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| That's what I understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| I think that's what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| And the note is identified by Mr. Bruchka would be on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6924)|
| 1:55:28| The plat, as I understand, does have that note and that shading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| but the note does state that it's the opinion that it is not an active sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6932)|
| 1:55:39| Yeah, why would we have to remove the note?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6939)|
| 1:55:42| I wouldn't want to remove the note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6942)|
| 1:55:44| We could leave it on there, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| And that note is on the plat, the one that was read by Mr. Bruchka.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6946)|
| 1:55:52| Mr. King, do you have something quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6952)|
| 1:55:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6955)|
| 1:55:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6956)|
| 1:55:59| Then I'd like to hear from some other commissioners that have had their lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6959)|
| 1:56:05| I would like to be heard, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6965)|
| 1:56:08| We will call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6968)|
| 1:56:11| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6971)|
| 1:56:13| After all this discussion, I think that staff has it exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6973)|
| 1:56:19| I move that we deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6979)|
| 1:56:21| Mr. Graf, there's already a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6981)|
| 1:56:25| That was about 15 minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6985)|
| 1:56:31| Mr. King, if you can keep it, we do have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6991)|
| 1:56:37| If you can keep it very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| I think we've missed the point and got started talking about ways to solve a problem that you don't have to be faced with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=6999)|
| 1:56:49| Way back when this started, you all took care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7009)|
| 1:56:52| You all averted the problem of dealing with a sinkhole by putting a note on the map about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7012)|
| 1:57:04| If you're going to go over there, you're going to need to use Mr. Bruchka's microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7024)|
| 1:57:11| If you're going to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7031)|
| 1:57:12| We'll block you, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7032)|
| 1:57:14| Yeah, why are we doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| Back in 04, that area right there showed the location of the sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7037)|
| 1:57:26| We're talking today about this big one down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7046)|
| 1:57:30| That was on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7050)|
| 1:57:32| Then we come over to another one filed in March of 05 still has those sinkholes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7052)|
| 1:57:43| Guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7063)|
| 1:57:46| What got filed as a subdivision plan, those sinkholes, they went away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7066)|
| 1:57:58| They didn't have to deal with the issue of how far away from it had to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7078)|
| 1:58:04| It just changed the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| All of a sudden, that disappeared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7086)|
| 1:58:09| There's one that's a little bit plainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7089)|
| 1:58:11| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7091)|
| 1:58:12| We do have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| The motion was made by Commissioner Clancy to deny the final plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7094)|
| 1:58:19| It was seconded by Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| I think that we're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| All in favor to deny the final plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7105)|
| 1:58:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7111)|
| 1:58:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7113)|
| 1:58:37| I don't think that we need to do a voice count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7117)|
| 1:58:41| I think that the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7121)|
| 1:58:43| Those who voted no, just raise your hand so we can get the correct number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7123)|
| 1:58:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7127)|
| 1:58:48| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7128)|
| 1:58:49| I wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7129)|
| 1:58:53| In the case on agenda item number 14, the final plat has been denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7133)|

| 2:02:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7352)|
| 2:02:33| Ralph Smith, 205 Lamar Avenue, Clinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7353)|
| 2:02:36| I represent the owner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7356)|
| 2:02:38| The only reason we asked for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7358)|
| 2:02:39| Sir, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7359)|
| 2:02:40| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7360)|
| 2:02:43| There is no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7363)|
| 2:02:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7364)|
| 2:02:45| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7365)|
| 2:02:46| I had to pull my own here because of the two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7366)|
| 2:02:53| We just needed the conditions to be worded a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7373)|
| 2:02:56| I talked with Mike Reynolds today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7376)|
| 2:02:59| It spoke about no more than one access drive permitted to Kate Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7379)|
| 2:03:03| We were actually rezoning this so that we can cut another lot off of the north side of that property right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7383)|
| 2:03:10| And if we left it worded the way it was, we wouldn't be able to get access to that lot off of Kate Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7390)|
| 2:03:16| So we just wanted to clear up that wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7396)|
| 2:03:19| That's why we rezoned so we could redo that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7399)|
| 2:03:22| And we'll have a plat here before you next month to do that resubdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7402)|
| 2:03:29| And we also have an existing driveway that comes out on the east side of this property on West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7409)|
| 2:03:36| And it said one of the recommendations, one of the conditions was no access drive be permitted to West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7416)|
| 2:03:42| We already have one, and we just wanted to make sure that what that really said was we couldn't create any new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7422)|
| 2:03:48| Mr. Reynolds, would you like to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7428)|
| 2:03:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7430)|
| 2:03:51| The two conditions that he spoke about, staff recommended those because of some of the access issues and traffic that are on Kate Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7431)|
| 2:03:59| The property to the north of this one was rezoned in 2018 and had a condition of only one access to Kate Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7439)|
| 2:04:06| And the intent there is you can create as many lots as the RE zone will allow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7446)|
| 2:04:11| but we would like you to share access because of the traffic that Kate Road does have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7451)|
| 2:04:16| So that was the thought process going forward with this property that is closer to the intersection of Emory and Kate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7456)|
| 2:04:22| And looking at this, I agree that I think changing the two conditions to say for the first one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7462)|
| 2:04:34| no more than two driveways to Kate Road that would allow the existing driveway for the existing house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7474)|
| 2:04:40| and it would allow one new access driveway for the new lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7480)|
| 2:04:44| If this property were to be sold and they decided to split it up into several lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7484)|
| 2:04:49| they would still be limited to just two driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7489)|
| 2:04:51| So I think that's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7491)|
| 2:04:53| And again, on the condition number two where we were saying no access to Emory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7493)|
| 2:04:59| the intent was there to be really no new access to Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7499)|
| 2:05:03| They do have one existing driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7503)|
| 2:05:05| Part of the concern is you can't see it in this image,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7505)|
| 2:05:08| but when the new subdivision went in across the street, across Emory, TDOT required them to put in turn lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7508)|
| 2:05:16| So in front of their property, in front of the subject property on Emory, there is a turn lane there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7516)|
| 2:05:23| So obviously TDOT is going to have to approve any driveway permit to Emory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7523)|
| 2:05:28| but this has had some concern that potential of having more driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7528)|
| 2:05:32| I think changing that to say either to say no new access to Emory would be fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7532)|
| 2:05:38| or just saying no more than one driveway access to West Emory would work as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7538)|
| 2:05:44| So the first one would just say no more than two access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7544)|
| 2:05:47| and the second one would say no more than one access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7547)|
| 2:05:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7551)|
| 2:05:52| Sir, did you have anything else you wanted to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7552)|
| 2:05:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7554)|
| 2:05:55| Okay. Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7555)|
| 2:05:56| I'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7556)|
| 2:05:57| We recommend the county commission approve RA, low-density residential zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7557)|
| 2:06:00| subject to two conditions which state no more than condition number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7560)|
| 2:06:05| no more than two access drives will be permitted to Kate Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7565)|
| 2:06:08| regardless of the number of lots created from the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7568)|
| 2:06:12| Condition number two, no new access drive will be permitted to West Emory Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7572)|
| 2:06:16| regardless of the number of lots created from the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7576)|
| 2:06:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7580)|

| 2:08:34| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7714)|
| 2:08:35| Just wanted to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7715)|
| 2:08:36| I'm not familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7716)|
| 2:08:37| You're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7717)|
| 2:08:38| You're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7718)|
| 2:08:41| This property first came to our attention when we found out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7721)|
| 2:08:43| Ma'am, could you pull the microphone down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7723)|
| 2:08:46| Yeah, that might be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7726)|
| 2:08:48| This property first came to our attention sometime at the end of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7728)|
| 2:08:53| We knew that somebody passed away from there, and then I guess it was handed down to somebody in the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7733)|
| 2:08:58| We don't really know the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7738)|
| 2:09:01| We think it was from January 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7741)|
| 2:09:04| One of the neighbors had to call or neighbors called the fire department because there's noxious fumes coming from this property where whoever was on it was burning trash to try to get rid of some of the trash that you see in these pictures here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7744)|
| 2:09:22| The reason those pictures were taken was because this person, whoever the applicant is, had put an ad on Craigslist to have people come in there and remove whatever they wanted on that property, so they're just random people coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7762)|
| 2:09:36| And so we went, the neighbors and I went, to take pictures to see what was on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7776)|
| 2:09:43| Our concerns are many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7783)|
| 2:09:45| One of them have to do with environmental protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7785)|
| 2:09:49| It looks like the dam that was built there to hold in the pond that's shared by three people, one of them being this property owner, and he owns the majority of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7789)|
| 2:09:58| If you could see...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7798)|
| 2:10:01| Sorry, I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7801)|
| 2:10:03| There's a pond that's on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| We're not exactly sure how large it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7805)|
| 2:10:07| One of the neighbors that abuts the property is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7807)|
| 2:10:11| He owns just a very small portion of that pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7811)|
| 2:10:16| That's Michael here, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7816)|
| 2:10:20| In the top right-hand corner, that little tiny area right there is where...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7820)|
| 2:10:26| Yes, that right there is what Michael owns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7826)|
| 2:10:30| We are adjacent to that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7830)|
| 2:10:32| The other neighbors that were here that had to leave, they're also adjacent to that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7832)|
| 2:10:38| Our concerns are that you can see by the pictures that all the trash was plowed underneath the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7838)|
| 2:10:46| And we think that the dam is built of some sort of tires and debris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7846)|
| 2:10:52| We can't really tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7852)|
| 2:10:54| You can see in one of the pictures there, you can see the trickle out of the pond that goes to other people's properties that is just filled with tires and trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7854)|
| 2:11:08| We have some concerns about who this person is going to sell to, why this would even be permitted in our rural area to have three houses on one acre, when it doesn't seem suitable to have any houses over there, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7868)|
| 2:11:24| We have concerns about the things that I listed there, which have to do with soil testing and engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7884)|
| 2:11:32| Who are the engineers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7892)|
| 2:11:33| Who's the architecture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7893)|
| 2:11:35| Who has the financial resources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7895)|
| 2:11:38| We don't know anything about this person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7898)|
| 2:11:41| And who's going to have a homeowners association?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7901)|
| 2:11:46| Who's going to head it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7906)|
| 2:11:48| We just don't know what to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7908)|
| 2:11:52| As you can see from the pictures, they pretty much speak for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7912)|
| 2:11:55| If this is the length of the responsibility that this person is going to show to our community, we're just very distressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7915)|
| 2:12:04| To plow under your trash, to burn your trash, we just don't want this to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7924)|
| 2:12:16| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7936)|
| 2:12:17| Those pictures are horrendous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7937)|
| 2:12:20| County Engineering, that's not a landfill, I'm assuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7940)|
| 2:12:24| Well, it looks like a landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7944)|
| 2:12:26| And that is, as far as you can see around you, all those pictures are taken from as far as you can see on those four and a half acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7946)|
| 2:12:35| And I don't know why they would approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7955)|
| 2:12:40| To us, we're astounded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7960)|
| 2:12:44| We have enough problems on that street as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7964)|
| 2:12:49| Have you guys reported to county that there are toxic things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7969)|
| 2:12:56| If you look up on county codes, almost every house around there has had issues with trash, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7976)|
| 2:13:05| But to us, it's just not acceptable to have someone come up there and literally bulldoze all the trash underneath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7985)|
| 2:13:16| If you look at the pond, would anybody like to live around a pond like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=7996)|
| 2:13:21| That's in this gentleman's backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8001)|
| 2:13:24| That's right across the street from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8004)|
| 2:13:29| It's not like it's a long road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8009)|
| 2:13:33| And so you folks have called county with regards to codes, with regards to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8013)|
| 2:13:38| Well, no, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8018)|
| 2:13:40| We were just actually up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8020)|
| 2:13:42| These pictures are just from last week because we saw this ad in Craigslist, come and pick up anything you want for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8022)|
| 2:13:48| So none of us have had access to the property until everybody in the public was allowed to go out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8028)|
| 2:13:55| So we just have some serious concerns and we would like somebody to pay attention to us, even though we're out in a rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8035)|
| 2:14:03| This is not very far off of our street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8043)|
| 2:14:06| This is literally right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8046)|
| 2:14:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8048)|
| 2:14:09| And paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8049)|
| 2:14:10| And, again, I asked if you had talked to the county or called county codes, and you said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8050)|
| 2:14:17| How are people going to pay attention if you're not reaching out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8057)|
| 2:14:21| Well, I guess because we were kind of astonished that they had approved this to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8061)|
| 2:14:26| No one has approved anything yet, and I would imagine that there was never any request for approval of the dumping of the debris on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8066)|
| 2:14:37| We can notify county codes of the issues here based on the information you presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8077)|
| 2:14:43| but the only way they're aware of the issues is through notification from the neighbors or what you're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8083)|
| 2:14:50| Nothing has been approved yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8090)|
| 2:14:52| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8092)|
| 2:14:53| We, I guess, misunderstood and thought that the staff had already approved putting three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8093)|
| 2:14:59| That's a recommendation from the staff to this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8099)|
| 2:15:03| and the process is that the staff reviews a request that's made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8103)|
| 2:15:06| In this case, it was for zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8106)|
| 2:15:09| The staff reviews that request, makes a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8109)|
| 2:15:12| This commission hears the staff recommendation at the public hearing at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8112)|
| 2:15:19| Then this commission makes a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8119)|
| 2:15:22| If that recommendation is for approval, it goes on to the county commission for final action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8122)|
| 2:15:27| If this commission recommends denial, it stops here and that request is denied unless the applicant appeals it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8127)|
| 2:15:34| then it would go on to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8134)|
| 2:15:36| Whether it's approved or this commission recommends approval or it's denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8136)|
| 2:15:41| and then the applicant requests or appeals that, if it goes on to county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8141)|
| 2:15:47| you would receive another notification letting you know when the county commission would hear the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8147)|
| 2:15:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8154)|
| 2:15:55| So I guess we're asking that this commission deny this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8155)|
| 2:16:01| And we will notify county codes of the issues with the debris and the trash on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8161)|
| 2:16:07| I don't know if anybody else has anything to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8167)|
| 2:16:09| The other neighbors had to leave, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8169)|
| 2:16:12| It's been a long meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8172)|
| 2:16:14| I believe that you still got one minute, nine seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8174)|
| 2:16:19| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8179)|
| 2:16:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8180)|
| 2:16:21| You still have another minute if anybody wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8181)|
| 2:16:24| Unless anybody has any questions, we're not really very often, we don't attend these meetings very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8184)|
| 2:16:31| We're in a more rural area of Knoxville, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8191)|
| 2:16:34| Well, we appreciate you showing up and paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8194)|
| 2:16:38| Because, again, it's citizens coming forward and letting us know that that is the important part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8198)|
| 2:16:46| and we appreciate you showing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8206)|
| 2:16:48| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8208)|
| 2:16:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8210)|
| 2:16:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8211)|
| 2:16:53| The pictures are horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8213)|
| 2:16:55| I think that's just a disgrace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8215)|
| 2:16:58| But the way you take care of that is you call Knox County codes or call Knox County and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8218)|
| 2:17:04| there's a dump being operated in our neighborhood, and it's not good, and we'd like somebody to come look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8224)|
| 2:17:11| They send people out there, and they deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8231)|
| 2:17:14| A lot of times what they'll do is they'll go out, clean it up, and charge the people that own the property to clean it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8234)|
| 2:17:21| Having said that, someone coming in and applying to put a subdivision of any sort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8241)|
| 2:17:27| any kind of development on that means they're willing to put some money into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8247)|
| 2:17:31| That doesn't, and even if it's approved here, it has to come back to us for a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8251)|
| 2:17:38| They have to show us what they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8258)|
| 2:17:40| Concept means, okay, this is where the road's going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8260)|
| 2:17:43| These are where the houses are going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8263)|
| 2:17:44| This is how we're going to get sewer water and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8264)|
| 2:17:47| That has to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8267)|
| 2:17:49| Even if this is approved, this is just the zoning and the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8269)|
| 2:17:54| If it's approved, it comes back as a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8274)|
| 2:17:59| So there's several steps to this, but the best way to get this fixed very well could be approving this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8279)|
| 2:18:07| and getting somebody doing something on that that will generate revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8287)|
| 2:18:14| and be something other than an open dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8294)|
| 2:18:18| So I'm going to make a motion that we recommend that County Commission approve PR plan residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8298)|
| 2:18:24| up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8304)|
| 2:18:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8308)|
| 2:18:29| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8309)|
| 2:18:33| We are not going to vote on this because we do have lights on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8313)|
| 2:18:37| and we're going to start with Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8317)|
| 2:18:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8319)|
| 2:18:41| A couple of issues, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8321)|
| 2:18:42| One, the applicant's not present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8322)|
| 2:18:44| And while that's not required, it does show a lack of interest in the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8324)|
| 2:18:49| I'm in favor of rezoning it, but I think it needs to be cleaned up environmentally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8329)|
| 2:18:55| and it looks like an illegal dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8335)|
| 2:18:57| And until that is done, I cannot support any rezoning at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8337)|
| 2:19:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8345)|
| 2:19:07| Do we have the, who is this, Mr. Reynolds or Mr. Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8347)|
| 2:19:12| do we have the right to say that we're perhaps to post, I guess we could vote to postpone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8352)|
| 2:19:19| but do we have a right to have a requirement that the dump be cleaned up before we take action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8359)|
| 2:19:27| Or maybe that's Mr. Wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8367)|
| 2:19:29| I'm going to defer to Mr. Wise on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8369)|
| 2:19:32| Yeah, that's not a land use issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8372)|
| 2:19:34| The short answer is no, but there are other offices, of course, engineering and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8374)|
| 2:19:40| that are in place to make the necessary enforcement, and that information will go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8380)|
| 2:19:46| But it's not a land use issue that is appropriate for consideration by way of condition or otherwise by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8386)|
| 2:19:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8392)|
| 2:19:54| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8394)|
| 2:19:58| I think I agree with Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8398)|
| 2:20:00| Even though it's not a land use issue and we're not putting conditions on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8400)|
| 2:20:02| I don't feel like we should reward an applicant that is allowing their property and the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8402)|
| 2:20:07| and the surroundings to be polluted like they currently are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8407)|
| 2:20:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8411)|
| 2:20:12| Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8412)|
| 2:20:15| I'm kind of torn on this one because it does seem like the applicant ought to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8415)|
| 2:20:20| He ought to have some interest in what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8420)|
| 2:20:23| but at the same time I agree with Commissioner Clancy in that it seems like the best way to clean this property up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8423)|
| 2:20:31| is with a development, and especially if there's any kind of financing involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8431)|
| 2:20:35| There's all kinds of checks and balances there where nobody's going to allow a project to go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8435)|
| 2:20:41| without it being environmentally sound and something that can be marketable to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8441)|
| 2:20:53| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8453)|
| 2:20:54| I'm going to listen to some of the other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8454)|
| 2:20:56| I think we were hoping that the gentleman that applied would have had the courtesy to show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8456)|
| 2:21:03| to give us some sort of explanation as to what is going on on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8463)|
| 2:21:06| Well, he may have thought it was on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8466)|
| 2:21:08| He should still show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8468)|
| 2:21:11| Ma'am, you've got another fellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8471)|
| 2:21:14| I know you guys have just a kind of short amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8474)|
| 2:21:17| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8477)|
| 2:21:18| I'll make it quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8478)|
| 2:21:19| Michael Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8479)|
| 2:21:20| I'm at 615 Coram Road, 37924.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8480)|
| 2:21:23| Just kind of to reiterate what she was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8483)|
| 2:21:25| our biggest concern is that he doesn't seem like he has a lot of interest in what's good for the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8485)|
| 2:21:29| and I know you guys have spoken a lot about that today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8489)|
| 2:21:31| that you take into consideration what's good for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8491)|
| 2:21:34| So like the Craigslist ad was posted, he didn't alert any of the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8494)|
| 2:21:41| I have things that I would be concerned about people potentially trying to steal, a lawnmower or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8501)|
| 2:21:46| but it would have been nice to get just some kind of communication with the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8506)|
| 2:21:50| or whoever they are at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8510)|
| 2:21:52| There's been no consideration to any of the neighbors in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8512)|
| 2:21:55| On top of that, the traffic that would be affected by the additional units of the development is a concern for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8515)|
| 2:22:01| and really we just would like to feel like we're involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8521)|
| 2:22:06| I'm at 615, which is the one right on the other side of the pond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8526)|
| 2:22:10| and I've never had a conversation with him since the day the man who owned it originally died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8530)|
| 2:22:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8537)|
| 2:22:18| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8538)|
| 2:22:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8539)|
| 2:22:20| The tax records show this guy that has it, it's applied, bought it in 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8540)|
| 2:22:25| and as I look back at 2016 and 15 aerials, it was a dump then too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8545)|
| 2:22:29| I don't think that he created the mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8549)|
| 2:22:31| I think that the mess was there prior to him acquiring the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8551)|
| 2:22:36| and if you remember, this was on consent, and so a new guy may have thought he didn't need to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8556)|
| 2:22:42| And he's taken a step by coming and applying for a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8562)|
| 2:22:46| He paid $600 to try to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8566)|
| 2:22:48| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8568)|
| 2:22:49| I'm not saying the guy's a great guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8569)|
| 2:22:50| I don't know him, but I'm just saying this is explainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8570)|
| 2:22:52| There is a mess prior to him being involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8572)|
| 2:22:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8574)|
| 2:22:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8575)|
| 2:22:56| But rezoning does not indicate development is going to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8576)|
| 2:22:58| It just means rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8578)|
| 2:22:59| Commissioner Phillips, if you put your light on, I'll be glad to call you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8579)|
| 2:23:03| Commissioner Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8583)|
| 2:23:05| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8585)|
| 2:23:08| I agree with Patrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8588)|
| 2:23:10| You know, we've got a major environmental issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8590)|
| 2:23:12| We're not only saturating the property that he owns, but we're saturating the neighbors who share a lake with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8592)|
| 2:23:19| If we can delay a piece of property because a sign's placed in a wrong area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8599)|
| 2:23:24| surely we can delay something until the county has a chance to take a look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8604)|
| 2:23:28| and force these people to clean this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8608)|
| 2:23:30| Development will do that, but, you know, that just prolongs the fact that this is a disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8610)|
| 2:23:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8620)|
| 2:23:41| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8621)|
| 2:23:42| I was going to add that I can support just a postponement, if we wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8622)|
| 2:23:45| so that we can find out more about it, have codes have a chance to find out what's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8625)|
| 2:23:48| and see what the intent of the current owner is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8628)|
| 2:23:51| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8631)|
| 2:23:52| I also would be supportive of a postponement, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8632)|
| 2:23:57| I know that you should always, if you are an applicant, you should always stay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8637)|
| 2:24:03| even if your item is on the consent list, because there is an option that it could be pulled off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8643)|
| 2:24:12| And so I would also support a postponement for the applicant to be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8652)|
| 2:24:18| But that being said, we do have a motion on the table by Commissioner Clancy to approve the PR planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8658)|
| 2:24:26| and it's seconded by Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8666)|
| 2:24:29| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8669)|
| 2:24:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8670)|
| 2:24:31| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8671)|
| 2:24:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8672)|
| 2:24:33| Let's do a roll call, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8673)|
| 2:24:43| Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8683)|
| 2:24:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8684)|
| 2:24:45| Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8685)|
| 2:24:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8686)|
| 2:24:47| Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8687)|
| 2:24:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8688)|
| 2:24:49| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8689)|
| 2:24:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8690)|
| 2:24:51| Commissioner Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8691)|
| 2:24:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8692)|
| 2:24:53| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8693)|
| 2:24:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8694)|
| 2:24:55| Commissioner Goodwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8695)|
| 2:24:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8696)|
| 2:24:57| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8697)|
| 2:24:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8698)|
| 2:24:59| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8699)|
| 2:25:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8702)|
| 2:25:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8703)|
| 2:25:04| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8704)|
| 2:25:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8705)|
| 2:25:06| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8706)|
| 2:25:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8707)|
| 2:25:08| Commissioner Toker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8708)|
| 2:25:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8709)|
| 2:25:10| Motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8710)|
| 2:25:14| Motion postponed for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8714)|
| 2:25:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8715)|
| 2:25:17| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Hill to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8717)|
| 2:25:22| Who did you, who are you pointing at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8722)|
| 2:25:25| Crowder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8725)|
| 2:25:26| I'm sorry, a second by Commissioner Crowder to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8726)|
| 2:25:31| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8731)|
| 2:25:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8733)|
| 2:25:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8734)|
| 2:25:36| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8736)|
| 2:25:37| So this is going to be postponed for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8737)|
| 2:25:40| In the meantime...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8740)|
| 2:25:42| I'll notify County Coach tomorrow of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8742)|
| 2:25:45| I'll scan the photos and send those to County Coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8745)|
| 2:25:50| The photos are ours now, but I will scan those and send those to County Coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8750)|
| 2:25:55| And can staff please get a hold of the applicant and let him or her know to be here and speak on behalf of their application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8755)|
| 2:26:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8763)|
| 2:26:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8765)|
| 2:26:06| And thank you for the community for showing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8766)|
| 2:26:08| And thank you for, yeah, just kind of noticing what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8768)|
| 2:26:13| Because otherwise, without you folks' input, this would have gone through on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8773)|
| 2:26:19| But now you're making people aware of issues within your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8779)|
| 2:26:24| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8784)|
| 2:26:25| I want to ask, did we keep the photos?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8785)|
| 2:26:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8788)|
| 2:26:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8789)|
| 2:26:30| Do you want a copy of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8790)|
| 2:26:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8791)|
| 2:26:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8792)|
| 2:26:34| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8794)|
| 2:26:35| They're in their position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8795)|
| 2:26:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8796)|
| 2:26:37| How large is a tiny house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8797)|
| 2:26:40| Tiny houses range from 300 square feet to 600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8800)|
| 2:26:49| Once they get past much 600, 650, they're considered small houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8809)|
| 2:26:54| There was a development on Richmond Avenue, Richmond, that is small houses that this commission approved the site plan for a year or two ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8814)|
| 2:27:05| There's been some articles about it, but those are small homes, about 800 square feet, 800 to 1,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8825)|
| 2:27:11| Are they sold with property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8831)|
| 2:27:14| The ones on Richmond Avenue are condo-style ownership where the home is sold but all the land is held in common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8834)|
| 2:27:22| Next agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8842)|
| 2:27:23| Oh, you're not doing minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8843)|
| 2:27:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8846)|
| 2:27:27| Next is agenda item number 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8847)|
| 2:27:29| Applicant is Primos Land Company, Estes Express.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8849)|
| 2:27:33| The location is the southeast side of Strawberry Plains Pike, southeast end of Neal's Commerce Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8853)|
| 2:27:40| Contract information is 36.56 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8860)|
| 2:27:44| Present plan designation zoning is GC General Commercial and ST Stream Protection Area slash C6 General Commercial Park and F1 Floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8864)|
| 2:27:57| Proposed plan designation zoning is MUSD Mixed Use Special District and ST Stream Protection Area slash I3 General Industrial and F1 Floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8877)|
| 2:28:09| Existing land use is agriculture, forestry, vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8889)|
| 2:28:13| The proposed use is a truck terminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8893)|
| 2:28:16| Staff recommendation is there will be two votes on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8896)|
| 2:28:20| One is adopt Resolution 3-B-19-SP amending the East County Sector Plan to MUSD Mixed Use Special District ECO7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8900)|
| 2:28:34| and recommend that City Council also adopt the Sector Plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8914)|
| 2:28:39| Also to approve I3 General Industrial District zoning subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8919)|
| 2:28:44| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8924)|
| 2:28:47| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8927)|
| 2:28:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8932)|
| 2:28:53| And before we get started, I'd like Mr. Green is going to make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8933)|
| 2:28:58| This is just as a prelude to Ms. Albertson's presentation of the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8938)|
| 2:29:03| As I stated at the agenda review meeting, this was a tough issue for the planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8943)|
| 2:29:10| We debated this quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8950)|
| 2:29:12| And some of the information we've gotten since then we've provided to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8952)|
| 2:29:17| Our plans review and inspections office of the city which administers zoning code has stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8957)|
| 2:29:23| and the information has been provided to you that parking for the truck terminal could occur in the C6 zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8963)|
| 2:29:30| That minimizes the need for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8970)|
| 2:29:33| It appears that the development could occur without the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8973)|
| 2:29:37| There has been quite a bit of citizen input on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8977)|
| 2:29:40| And there is some history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8980)|
| 2:29:42| And I'll let Ms. Albertson pick it up from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8982)|
| 2:29:44| But I just wanted to let you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8984)|
| 2:29:46| Thank you, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8986)|
| 2:29:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8988)|
| 2:29:49| In 2006, there was a rezoning and one-year plan amendment for the entire parcel to go from C6 to I3 on the back 30-plus acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8989)|
| 2:29:59| and C6 to C3 on the front six acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=8999)|
| 2:30:03| The back portion was approved to I3 while the front portion was denied C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9003)|
| 2:30:09| And so it remained C6 so that planning staff would get an opportunity to review a site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9009)|
| 2:30:15| for any commercial development on the front six acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9015)|
| 2:30:19| The request for I3 on the back 30-plus acres at that time was for a then-proposed truck terminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9019)|
| 2:30:27| Again, as Gerald mentioned, we inquired with the city about the impact of the C6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9027)|
| 2:30:35| on the potential to develop it as a truck terminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9035)|
| 2:30:38| And we were told that access and parking can be permitted in that C6 portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9038)|
| 2:30:45| as long as they meet the C6 site requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9045)|
| 2:30:50| But the actual terminal can be located in I3 without having to rezone the front portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9050)|
| 2:30:57| However, all facets of the terminal use need to be located in the I3 portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9057)|
| 2:31:01| such as storage, accessory buildings, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9061)|
| 2:31:05| A parking lot for employees could be allowed also in the C6 section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9065)|
| 2:31:11| So as staff, we are recommending approval of the I3 district zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9071)|
| 2:31:17| as an extension of the existing I3 zoning subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9077)|
| 2:31:24| We heard from about 30-plus community members via e-mail or phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9084)|
| 2:31:33| regarding their opposition to this use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9093)|
| 2:31:38| There is an adjacent residential use where the existing OB zoning is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9098)|
| 2:31:43| So the one condition that we're recommending is a landscape screen along frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9103)|
| 2:31:49| on Strawberry Plains Pike and then on the side lot line adjacent to parcel 084044,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9109)|
| 2:31:57| consistent with the perimeter screening requirements that we are pulling from Section 7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9117)|
| 2:32:04| of the City of Knoxville's Zoning Ordinance for off-street parking access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9124)|
| 2:32:09| driveway, and landscape requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9129)|
| 2:32:12| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9132)|
| 2:32:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9135)|
| 2:32:17| Applicant, would you like to go first or opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9137)|
| 2:32:20| I'll let opposition go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9140)|
| 2:32:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9141)|
| 2:32:24| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9144)|
| 2:32:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9145)|
| 2:32:26| My name is Cliff Honaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9146)|
| 2:32:28| I live at 6420 Strawberry Plains Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9148)|
| 2:32:34| It's a 160-acre farm circa 1812 at Kennedy Shriver Estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9154)|
| 2:32:41| Dora Kennedy was the first female superintendent for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9161)|
| 2:32:48| Dora Kennedy Elementary School is just a stone's throw from the farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9168)|
| 2:32:52| The farm is about 5,000 feet from that place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9172)|
| 2:32:57| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9177)|
| 2:32:58| I just heard about this from the minister next door who asked me to come just yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9178)|
| 2:33:06| Y'all sign, the NPC sign is dwarfed by these giant earth-moving machines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9186)|
| 2:33:16| that are sitting there at the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9196)|
| 2:33:20| It's Truon Rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9200)|
| 2:33:23| And I called Truon and asked them, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9203)|
| 2:33:26| is something going on here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9206)|
| 2:33:27| And they said, well, no, nothing's going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9207)|
| 2:33:30| And so I just heard about this, you know, very shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9210)|
| 2:33:35| So I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9215)|
| 2:33:37| My comments may seem a little bit scattered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9217)|
| 2:33:41| But being the steward for 160 acres of a historical farm for 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9221)|
| 2:33:49| having a Master's in Environmental Health Sociology at University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9229)|
| 2:33:54| and founding American Environmental Health Studies Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9234)|
| 2:33:57| I can tell you that there are a number of problems that need to be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9237)|
| 2:34:02| need to be studied academically, need to be studied neutrally, third-party neutrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9242)|
| 2:34:09| We had third-party neutral students and grad students from the University of Tennessee Ag Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9249)|
| 2:34:15| come and do a six-month study of the land that I've been living on for 30 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9255)|
| 2:34:21| as a hypothetical for a wilderness park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9261)|
| 2:34:25| One of the very first things they said was, we go back to the back of your farm and it's too loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9265)|
| 2:34:31| It's too loud for an urban wilderness park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9271)|
| 2:34:36| And they said they thought it was at first the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9276)|
| 2:34:41| But right next to where they're talking and putting that is Pilot Gas Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9281)|
| 2:34:47| Pilot Gas Station keeps 100, 150 trucks running every night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9287)|
| 2:34:53| And when it runs, it puts off this low subsonic sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9293)|
| 2:34:58| And it can be confused as the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9298)|
| 2:35:02| So you put another truck stop there and you're going to be loading it up with more noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9302)|
| 2:35:08| You don't need to get TDOT, which is 200 yards away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9308)|
| 2:35:13| but you could get TDOT to come over and do a study on loading that short little strip of four-lane road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9313)|
| 2:35:21| that goes up to the interstate, loading it with hundreds and hundreds of more trucks coming in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9321)|
| 2:35:27| And they might tell you we're already too congested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9327)|
| 2:35:30| But then that four-lane goes into a two-lane that has some really sharp curves in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9330)|
| 2:35:36| You know, I've lived there 32 years, and I can tell you the number of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9336)|
| 2:35:42| that truckers come down that road 60, 70 miles an hour, even though it's 45 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9342)|
| 2:35:48| And so you're going to be loading it up with more trucks going faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9348)|
| 2:35:52| And I literally take my life in my own hands when I pull into our driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9352)|
| 2:35:57| I've been rear-ended twice with people coming around right next to Mount Harmony Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9357)|
| 2:36:03| They fly around there at 60 miles an hour, and I'm pulling into my driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9363)|
| 2:36:07| So it doesn't take a physicist, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9367)|
| 2:36:13| I mean, you could go get physicists, and you should get physicists and biologists and people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9373)|
| 2:36:18| to look at loading 20 pounds of carbon an hour per truck for every truck that's sitting there idling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9378)|
| 2:36:25| on top of the other 150 trucks that pilot sitting there idling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9385)|
| 2:36:31| dispersing 20 pounds of carbon in the air every night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9391)|
| 2:36:36| But the number one concern that I have about this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9396)|
| 2:36:39| well, I've got two or three, but I don't really have time to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9399)|
| 2:36:43| The number one concern that I have, you all know we've had a lot of rain lately, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9403)|
| 2:36:50| The back of our farm has federally designated wetlands that have been designated by the Army Corps of Engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9410)|
| 2:36:58| and by TDEC, been characterized by both agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9418)|
| 2:37:02| So already the neighborhood is being impacted by water runoff coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9422)|
| 2:37:10| Even though you have that flood zone protected area, even though that's vacant right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9430)|
| 2:37:17| the load of water coming right now is already washing over the Wayland Bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9437)|
| 2:37:25| is already impacting the neighborhoods there, just as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9445)|
| 2:37:30| Now you load that much more pavement on, and I don't care what size retention pond you build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9450)|
| 2:37:39| that water is going to impact those federally designated wetlands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9459)|
| 2:37:46| So I would really urge you to, rather than postponing for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9466)|
| 2:37:53| I really urge you to pull the experts that you have in this community at the university| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9473)|
| 2:38:01| and do a real study, not only what is the environmental impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9481)|
| 2:38:06| Thank you, Mr. Honaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9486)|
| 2:38:07| Can I have two more minutes, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9487)|
| 2:38:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9490)|
| 2:38:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9491)|
| 2:38:13| To do an environmental impact, a cost-benefit analysis of what is the real impact of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9493)|
| 2:38:20| what are we going to have to pay as a community in terms of both what's going up in the air,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9500)|
| 2:38:26| what's the load onto the creeks, into the wetland, the damage to that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9506)|
| 2:38:37| But having lived on this farm for 32 years, having a lease for the next 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9517)|
| 2:38:44| having traveled over 600,000 miles in several countries doing environmental research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9524)|
| 2:38:50| we are blessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9530)|
| 2:38:52| Knoxville is blessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9532)|
| 2:38:54| We are one of the most blessed areas in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9534)|
| 2:38:58| And the blessing, our greatest asset, is our land, are our trees, are those rivers right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9538)|
| 2:39:08| are our mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9548)|
| 2:39:10| Those are the greatest assets that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9550)|
| 2:39:13| And the one thing that I would encourage you to do, I'm conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9553)|
| 2:39:19| I'm pro-development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9559)|
| 2:39:21| I'm not against you developing this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9561)|
| 2:39:24| But what I am, what I just encourage you to do, take our greatest assets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9564)|
| 2:39:30| work with the community, work with academia, work with the government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9570)|
| 2:39:35| and let's figure out a way to develop it in such a way that it improves the environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9575)|
| 2:39:42| that it improves our economics, and that it's good for the community as well as the corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9582)|
| 2:39:49| That's all I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9589)|
| 2:39:50| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9590)|
| 2:39:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9591)|
| 2:39:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9596)|
| 2:39:57| Josh Sanderson, 4909 Ball Road, representing Primos Land Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9597)|
| 2:40:04| Thank you for the opposition for that testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9604)|
| 2:40:07| I normally appear in front of you all for rezoning land for subdivision of a Smithville home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9607)|
| 2:40:12| so this is a little unique for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9612)|
| 2:40:15| This is a piece of property that we bought knowing that it is going to be industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9615)|
| 2:40:20| And to give you a little background, yes, we're Smithville homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9620)|
| 2:40:24| but the Smiths also own a lot of trucking terminals, used to own TriStar Trucking Company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9624)|
| 2:40:30| sold it but kept all the real estate, so they own multiple truck facilities across the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9630)|
| 2:40:35| Bought this piece when FedEx called us, said, look, this is where we want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9635)|
| 2:40:40| It's zoned out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9640)|
| 2:40:41| It's perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9641)|
| 2:40:42| Move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9642)|
| 2:40:43| They got a better deal at Midway, so they packed up and went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9643)|
| 2:40:46| We would have never bought the property if it wasn't zoned out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9646)|
| 2:40:49| We wouldn't be standing in front of you asking to rezone the front six acres of a 36-acre track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9649)|
| 2:40:53| if it wasn't already zoned out in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9653)|
| 2:40:56| So I understand the opposition, but we bought the property knowing it's zoned out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9656)|
| 2:41:01| knowing that a trucking terminal is going to go there in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9661)|
| 2:41:06| It sat vacant after we bought it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9666)|
| 2:41:08| and it sat vacant for so long that we moved our heavy equipment rental company, Truin Equipment, onto it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9668)|
| 2:41:14| So until we got the phone call from Estes, which they're a freight company on Shod Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9674)|
| 2:41:19| and they've been theirs for 30-something years, they called us and said, we've outgrown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9679)|
| 2:41:24| We're going to bring jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9684)|
| 2:41:25| We're going to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9685)|
| 2:41:26| We've outgrown our facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9686)|
| 2:41:28| We need a spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9688)|
| 2:41:29| So let's go out here to Strawberry Plains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9689)|
| 2:41:31| They looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9691)|
| 2:41:32| They loved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9692)|
| 2:41:33| They said, we'll buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9693)|
| 2:41:34| So we went under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9694)|
| 2:41:36| They don't move like we do as a developer, meaning when we're looking at the land, we're getting studies done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9696)|
| 2:41:40| We're soil testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9700)|
| 2:41:43| We're talking to county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9703)|
| 2:41:45| They're freight people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9705)|
| 2:41:47| They're not land developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9707)|
| 2:41:49| So the first step for them is to rezone the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9709)|
| 2:41:51| When they get rezoned, then they're going to do the soil test, then they're going to study the floodways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9711)|
| 2:41:55| and then they're going to do everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9715)|
| 2:41:56| But right now, I'm representing pretty much land company who owns the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9716)|
| 2:42:02| Estes is a freight company on Shod Road, very successful, wants to move out of Shod Road onto this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9722)|
| 2:42:09| They gave me a preliminary site plan, and I begged them for it because, again, this was a step ahead for their normal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9729)|
| 2:42:17| meaning they're not going to spend money on engineering and design if they know the property won't get rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9737)|
| 2:42:23| They put this together, which I sent to you all, along with an aerial showing all the other truck yards within a stone throwaway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9743)|
| 2:42:31| So what I'm asking today is this commission to take staff recommendation, rezone the front of it from C6 to I3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9751)|
| 2:42:39| I completely agree with buffering and landscape buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9759)|
| 2:42:43| But, again, that's what we're asking this commission to do, and I'll save any time or anything for any questions or comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9763)|
| 2:42:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9767)|
| 2:42:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9768)|
| 2:42:49| Sir, were you your opposition as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9769)|
| 2:42:56| You have 23 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9776)|
| 2:43:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9782)|
| 2:43:04| My name is Dale Roten. I own a property across the street, 7025 Straw Plains Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9784)|
| 2:43:11| The industrial zoning was done in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9791)|
| 2:43:15| They had none of this subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9795)|
| 2:43:17| They have condos across the street, which I've got plenty of e-mails from those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9797)|
| 2:43:22| The development across the street got some subdivisions across the street, and I'm sure you've got e-mails from those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9802)|
| 2:43:28| The church, which this gentleman goes to, I'm the one that actually went to the church and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9808)|
| 2:43:31| Are you aware of what's going on for industrial zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9811)|
| 2:43:36| This new element, since this 2006 zoning, I guess they bought the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9816)|
| 2:43:42| All these new residents, there's probably 250 residents or 300 in this area that looks at this every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9822)|
| 2:43:48| It's a two-lane road approximately half a mile from where these trucks are going to be parked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9828)|
| 2:43:55| I don't think anyone wants to live, and I can't walk in front of my property and get off the road and a truck come by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9835)|
| 2:44:00| It's that narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9840)|
| 2:44:02| I called for the traffic study, and there was none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9842)|
| 2:44:06| So I don't know how long it's been since you've done one, but it hasn't been done in a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9846)|
| 2:44:10| And since this time that this zoning was approved, there's been new Carter Elementary School down the road, Carter High,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9850)|
| 2:44:17| Carter Middle School, Pellissippi has been bought next door, all these places that drive right through this 35-acre trailer park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9857)|
| 2:44:26| Now, I know they can park cars up front where this topography is level or they're trying to rezone to I-3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9866)|
| 2:44:35| but where the industrial zoning is, it's steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9875)|
| 2:44:38| It's probably a 20-degree slope or more on the backside of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9878)|
| 2:44:42| but all on this blue that they're wanting to rezone is flat and level and good C property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9882)|
| 2:44:47| And these neighbors want something commercial, a grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9887)|
| 2:44:50| They sent people to buy this property, a grocery store, and they wouldn't even price it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9890)|
| 2:44:55| so I don't think it's a problem selling the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9895)|
| 2:44:57| It's them getting this back rezoning for their pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9897)|
| 2:45:00| No offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9900)|
| 2:45:02| I know they're in business to make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9902)|
| 2:45:03| I would be, too, but not at the neighborhood's expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9903)|
| 2:45:06| So I ask that you really consider denying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9906)|
| 2:45:09| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9909)|
| 2:45:10| C-3 to I-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9910)|
| 2:45:11| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9911)|
| 2:45:12| Ms. Hilbertson, I've got a question, especially with the trucking terminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9912)|
| 2:45:17| Speaking of the traffic study, are there traffic studies that are required when we're talking trucking terminals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9917)|
| 2:45:26| I'm going to defer to Mr. Williams on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9926)|
| 2:45:30| The city would be the one requiring the traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9930)|
| 2:45:33| Our standards have a trip generation threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9933)|
| 2:45:39| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9939)|
| 2:45:40| We would require a traffic study for a facility like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9940)|
| 2:45:45| Would the traffic study not need to come before the rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9945)|
| 2:45:50| No, because with that, and I'll answer for Mr. Williams here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9950)|
| 2:45:57| before the rezoning, we don't know what could happen on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9957)|
| 2:46:01| We have to have a development plan on which the traffic study would be based,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9961)|
| 2:46:06| and the trip generation and other aspects would be defined through the project description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9966)|
| 2:46:12| So the zoning has to come first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9972)|
