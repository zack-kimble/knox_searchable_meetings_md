| 0:01:48| And I would like to, this is one of those times where it's a shame we're not all in the same room, but I would like to welcome the BSA Scout Troops, the Boy Scouts of America Scout Troops 58 and 258.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=108)|
| 0:02:01| Troop 258 is an all-female troop chartered in Strawberry Plains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=121)|
| 0:02:07| The troop was established in April 2019 and was one of the first female BSA troops in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=127)|
| 0:02:15| BSA Troop 58 is an all-male troop also chartered in Strawberry Plains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=135)|
| 0:02:20| The troop's roots can be traced back into the 1920s in the Carter area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=140)|
| 0:02:26| Both troops regularly use the, oh, I'll mispronounce this, Paschal, thank you, Paschal Carter Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=146)|
| 0:02:35| And they focus on outdoor activities such as hiking and camping along with many necessary skills such as knot tying and fire building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=155)|
| 0:02:44| So they've joined us this evening to watch our board meeting and so I'm sure that they'll enjoy it quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=164)|
| 0:02:52| So welcome troop and we're glad you're here and hopefully you'll learn a little something tonight as we all will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=172)|
| 0:02:59| So welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=179)|
| 0:03:01| Do we have any changes to this agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| Okay, do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| Okay, we have a motion by Ms. Bounds, a second by Ms. Bowen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=194)|
| 0:03:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| Okay, and our vision mission spotlight this evening will be by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| So our vision to grow lifelong learners who contribute their talents, strengths, and skills to build a stronger community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=206)|
| 0:03:34| And our mission to provide excellent and accessible learning opportunities that empower all students to realize their full potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=214)|
| 0:03:44| And I just want to dedicate this vision and mission to our board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=224)|
| 0:03:50| We've seen throughout the nation school boards are struggling and crumbling and resigning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=230)|
| 0:03:56| And I think that we have done the best of our ability to govern Knox County Schools this year and kept it cordial and respectful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=236)|
| 0:04:05| So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| Even when we disagree, there's a level of respect that we have for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| So I appreciate that from you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| Yes, I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| Thank you, Ms. Satterfield, for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| Okay, I would like to refer to Superintendent Thomas for his report this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=256)|
| 0:04:22| Thank you, Madam Chair and members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| I appreciate the opportunity to provide some updates for you this evening, so bear with me tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=264)|
| 0:04:30| It may be a little longer than normal, so indulge me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| In tonight's report, I'd like to focus on a very important issue that will potentially affect all of our employees in hopefully a very positive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=274)|
| 0:04:42| In January, the General Assembly approved critical pay increases for teachers as well as school counselors, librarians, supervisors, principals, assistant principals, social workers, and psychologists during this unprecedented school year that's been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=282)|
| 0:05:00| As you stated, this action was a response to the enormous challenges presented by the pandemic, and our district expects to receive a little over $2.5 million from this allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=300)|
| 0:05:12| If we shared that funding equally among all certified personnel, it would amount to a pre-tax incentive of roughly $443.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=312)|
| 0:05:22| Shortly after the General Assembly action, our local lawmakers sent a letter to Mrs. Horne, Mayor Glenn Jacobs, and me requesting that these dollars be distributed only to employees who are licensed to teach and who spend 50% or more of their time instructing students in the classroom, in the library, in the gym, or in other settings, including online instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=322)|
| 0:05:46| So, if we took the $2.5 million and shared it with this group exclusively, it would amount to a pre-tax incentive of roughly $542 for each of these employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=346)|
| 0:05:59| This school year has brought about unprecedented challenges, and I'm incredibly grateful for all of our employees who have worked so diligently to provide both in-person and virtual instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=359)|
| 0:06:10| Our administrators, teachers, and staff have done an outstanding job of implementing new health and safety protocols to ensure our school buildings are safe for teaching and learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=370)|
| 0:06:20| At the same time, they successfully launched a brand new virtual learning program that is providing exceptional instruction for thousands of students who prefer to learn online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=380)|
| 0:06:32| We have asked our teachers to wear masks, check temperatures, sanitize high-touch areas, maintain physical distancing when possible, teach in-person, teach virtually, teach both in-person and virtually simultaneously, switch from in-person to virtual on short notice, and to prepare and maintain emergency lesson plans, teach additional classes, and cover classes when substitutes are not available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=392)|
| 0:06:56| And this is just a partial list of what we've asked for our teachers this year. Surprisingly, our teachers are still with us. I know they've worked extremely hard this year, as everyone has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=416)|
| 0:07:06| We've asked our principals to prepare master schedules for both in-person learning and virtual learning, teach classes for teachers who are absent, check temperatures, enforce our mask mandate, meet virtually with teachers and staff, maintain physical distancing when possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=426)|
| 0:07:22| be in attendance and enforce protocols for extracurricular activities, assist with contact tracing for students and staff, and to secure substitutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=442)|
| 0:07:31| Our central office administrators have worked tirelessly beyond the regular day during weekends and over holidays to provide support, resources, and strategies to help our schools be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=451)|
| 0:07:43| In recognition of their extraordinary achievements, I am recommending that we use the state funding previously mentioned and supplement it with local funding to provide all certified personnel with a $1,000 one-time critical pay increase during this year of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=463)|
| 0:08:01| At the same time, our classified employees have done an exceptional job to support our educational mission. Health services staff have worked on nights and weekends to conduct contact tracing while still performing the responsibilities of their work not related to COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=481)|
| 0:08:16| School nutrition employees have developed creative strategies to feed in-person learners along with virtual learners. Custodians have not only filled in for vacant positions but have also done extra cleaning to lower the spread of COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=496)|
| 0:08:30| Our security officers have kept students and staff safe while navigating all of the new procedures. School secretaries and teacher assistants have assisted our school administrators and teachers with all of the extra duties brought about by COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=510)|
| 0:08:45| Maintenance employees have worked extended shifts to ensure that work orders are completed in a timely manner, managed distribution of disinfectant, sprayers, misters, and PPEs, built and installed sneeze guards, and assembled and ran wiring for walk-through thermometers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=525)|
| 0:09:01| Our central office support staff has worked diligently to support our central office administrators and school staff with both virtual and in-person learning as well as provide customer service to our schools, families, and employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=541)|
| 0:09:16| With that in mind, I am recommending that all classified personnel receive a $500 one-time critical pay increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=556)|
| 0:09:24| I believe this recommendation accomplishes three important goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| One, it adheres to state guidance by ensuring that all state funding plus more is directed to certified personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=568)|
| 0:09:37| It aligns with the request of the Knox County Legislative Delegation by providing teachers an amount that exceeds what state funding alone would have provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=577)|
| 0:09:47| And it acknowledges the hard work of our classified employees by also providing them with incentive pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=587)|
| 0:09:53| Net of state funding, we estimate that this action will impact the general purpose budget by approximately $4.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=593)|
| 0:10:02| Sales tax collections continue to reflect positive trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| We're currently projecting a $23 million surplus by the end of the fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| Therefore, I feel comfortable in recommending this one-time critical pay increase for all of our employees in recognition of the commitment they have made to our students in such a challenging year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=610)|
| 0:10:20| I know that this has been a slightly longer report than usual, but I do feel it's an important issue and represents a tremendous opportunity to show our gratitude in a very tangible way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=620)|
| 0:10:30| And let me also thank our Board of Education for their leadership during this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=630)|
| 0:10:36| It's been a difficult year for our board with all the challenges, so I want to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| I wish I could pay you more, but I think the charter restricts that maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| I'm not sure Chris is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| He can tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| Bob, yeah, you can pay the board more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| I think, too, I believe we've been in attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| We've offered in-person instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| I think it is for maybe 106 days out of 115 days, which I think is pretty incredible for this school year for a district our size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=659)|
| 0:11:10| And, again, I just want to thank our employees, our teachers, our administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=670)|
| 0:11:16| I try to do this all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| I know it's not enough, but they have done an incredible job this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| And we've got seven days maybe to spring break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| So hopefully our folks can take a few days off, and we're going to come back after spring break, and we're going to wrap it up this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=685)|
| 0:11:33| And hopefully next year is going to be a little bit different, I'm hoping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| And maybe we can get somewhat back to normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| So thank you for the opportunity to provide my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| And that concludes my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| Thank you so much for that extended report this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| Anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| Okay, wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| Okay, we will move on to our next item, which is our ESSA 2.0 grant update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| And Mr. McPherson will be giving us an update on these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| Thank you, Madam Chair and members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| And I glanced over at Chris when Mr. Thomas said that, and I think Chris will absolutely be open to maybe transitioning some of the county funds into pay increases for the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=725)|
| 0:12:15| And I think he'd be happy to stay behind and talk to each individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| Thanks, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| So yesterday you received information on a recommended utilization of ESSA 2.0 funds totaling $50.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=742)|
| 0:12:31| Keep in mind, these are funds used to address issues arising from the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| We are recommending that the bulk of these funds, close to 70%, be used in three primary areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| That would be virtual instruction, sustainability of our one-to-one initiative, and also the purchase of textbooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=762)|
| 0:12:50| Our ELA and math adoption there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| So while we cannot use these funds to close revenue gaps in just our regular operation budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=773)|
| 0:13:01| in other words, we can't just take $50 million and throw it into the general fund and say, wonderful, our budget is balanced and we can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=781)|
| 0:13:09| We can't do that, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| But strategic use of these funds will significantly benefit the general purpose budget in indirect ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=791)|
| 0:13:19| because these are initiatives that otherwise we no doubt would be wanting to take a hard look at and trying to figure out ways we could fund them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=799)|
| 0:13:26| And so the only funding source that would be, absent of these extra funds, would be general purpose dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| So again, we can't use these funds to balance the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| We can use these funds to address needs that otherwise we would be forced to grapple with during the budget development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| I'm sure you've already reviewed the list, so I'm not going to read those off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=822)|
| 0:13:48| For the sake of time, I think probably it would just be more conducive to just open it up for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=828)|
| 0:13:54| Instead of just me reading the list off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| And I'll try to answer all those that I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| If I can't answer them, we have folks behind me and out in the foyer that can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=840)|
| 0:14:05| So anyway, Madam Chair, if that's okay with you, we'll just open it up for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| What questions do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| I can't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| It's hard to look this far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| On the virtual teaching positions, I'm thinking I'm doing these for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| Are we just somewhat predicting what we think we're going to need in virtual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| How are we going about coming up with that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| I may have to defer to Mr. Roswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| I can tell you that we're anticipating a cost of about $8 million for this year that are unbudgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| So what we're proposing is that we get reimbursement from those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=879)|
| 0:14:46| This would provide the remaining amount, which we estimate to be about $9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| We would use that for the upcoming school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| I think that's about 130-some-odd positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| What we have kind of run into this year, and you're probably asking, wait a minute, why is it more than this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=900)|
| 0:15:06| What we've had to rely on for this year is a lot of teachers, significant numbers of teachers, are teaching on their planning time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| So there's a lot of asynchronous instruction going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| What this would do would provide us with a dedicated staff, particularly at the high school level, that can focus strictly on synchronous instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=915)|
| 0:15:24| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| Does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| John can talk in more detail about it, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| I mean, we obviously had a large number of students that chose in the fall, and I'm sure, you know, obviously none of us know what the fall is going to bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=933)|
| 0:15:40| So I'm thinking this is probably a little hard to even predict how many students we're going to have wanting to do virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| So, you know, I just, I was kind of wondering about the wonders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| But I had one other question about the summer school transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| I'm assuming this is with the kind of required, what was coming out of legislation that we're going to need to do for summer school this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=952)|
| 0:16:00| It's my understanding there's no dollars in there for transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| Is this a John or a Russ question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| Yeah, that was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| The legislature is not providing transportation dollars, but they are providing dollars for the instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=967)|
| 0:16:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| Thank you, Ms. Fab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| Mr. Watson and then Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| Ms. Henderson was actually before all of us, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| Ms. Fab actually asked my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| Okay, Mr. Watson and then we'll go to Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| Mr. McPherson, what are some of the major items that were considered for this final list that ultimately ended up getting cut and why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=992)|
| 0:16:39| Well, I would probably characterize it as not necessarily getting cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| It's our hope that any, like for example, mental health, to bolster mental health support, we are looking at that to program into the current or the upcoming operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1003)|
| 0:16:56| So we took a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| You know, obviously intervention and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| So I don't want to characterize some of those things as being cut, but we've kind of fixed one half dozen of another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1021)|
| 0:17:09| They would be allowable too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| It's just that, you know, you kind of, whatever you fund in ASER, that provides opportunities in the general purpose budget to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1031)|
| 0:17:21| One thing we're very encouraged is that for the December, we received a December data point for sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1041)|
| 0:17:31| And we're still projecting around a $23 million surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| And that has held true over the last four data points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| It's kind of went between 22 and 23 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| I mean, it's very encouraging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| It's holding up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| So, you know, keep in mind that if this holds up, we can significantly raise budgetary revenues up to just a base level before we even talk about growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1064)|
| 0:17:54| So we're, again, I'll use the word encouraged there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| We're hoping that that will be maintained throughout the rest of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| John, did I miss anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| I know obviously mental health supports and interventions, those are really big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| The item that I was specifically interested in was the mental health supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| And so, you know, I'm glad to hear that you feel like we can still get the things done that we want to get done related to mental health supports in the general budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1094)|
| 0:18:21| Especially because I think that's also a compounding factor with COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| I think our mental health needs have certainly increased directly due to the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| I mean, obviously there's a lot of other traumas that families are experiencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| And again, I want to reiterate that it's not that mental health supports became lower on the priority list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1113)|
| 0:18:39| That wasn't the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| It's more about strategically how to re-leverage dollars one to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| This question is lifted up for anybody that can answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| I just want to give thought to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| The biggest question that I'm getting in my community when it comes to COVID relief funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1133)|
| 0:18:59| Will there be opportunity in the future and what does this look like and what will be the stipulations around community organizations that serve kids, KCS kids, that are opening their doors for this summer as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1139)|
| 0:19:12| Is there any relief fund or what are some of those stipulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| I know I had a conversation with Shannon that talked about the requirements for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| It's a long list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| Can you speak to it so we can get some answers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| I'll have to check into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| I think, Ms. Satterfield, what you may be asking is potentially federal dollars for nonprofits or partnering agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1166)|
| 0:19:33| I'll have to dig around a little bit on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| I'll be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| I really don't feel like I can do the answer justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| I apologize for not having that question to you sooner to have it prepared, but I would like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| Sure thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| And now we will turn to, let's see, our fine arts specialist, Heather Castile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1197)|
| 0:20:05| She's going to bring us the report on the Colorado Air Assault Study, which has been used to make determinations for fine arts in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1205)|
| 0:20:15| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| Thank you for allowing me this opportunity to give you this information today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| So last spring, we were seeing headlines like this, super spreader events from choir practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1224)|
| 0:20:34| One person is ill, they all sing together, and it gets 52 other people ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| There were deaths resulted from this one, too, in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| So we're kind of worried as fine arts teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| And in the summer, we get together, and with these headlines in mind, and as we see performing arts events closing down, and they continue to be closed down to this point, we're asking, is it safe to sing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1248)|
| 0:21:03| Can we even play instruments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| This was the question that was on our mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| Luckily for us, there's some research being done in Colorado.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1267)|
| 0:21:15| This is through the University of Colorado that we named the Colorado Air Assault Study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| It was commissioned by the National Federation of State High School Associations and the College Band Directors National Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1280)|
| 0:21:28| And it's supported by over 100 other organizations, which includes our national and our state music organizations, NAFME and TMEA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1288)|
| 0:21:38| Those are organizations that our teachers are members of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| They trust them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| We engage with them all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| The researchers are Dr. Shelly Miller and Yelena Serebrych.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1304)|
| 0:21:51| They are qualified in air quality, health effects, computational fluid dynamics, ventilation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1311)|
| 0:21:58| They are experts in their fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| And the goal of the study was to identify issues of air self-production in performing arts activities and to find a way forward so these activities will survive the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1320)|
| 0:22:12| We were worried kind of nationally that we weren't going to be able to do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1332)|
| 0:22:18| So what was great for us was that they decided to release their information as they went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| So we have preliminary results from July, August, and November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| The study has not concluded, and it's still in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| Once it is concluded, it will go into peer review and go through that process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| So we're really early in the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| They wanted us to have this information, though, so that we could figure out what we're doing in our classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1361)|
| 0:22:47| So what I'm about to go over is basically four parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| One is that singing and playing wind instruments, that's like the brass, like trombones, and clarinets, like woodwinds, they produce aerosols, which is different than normal talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1371)|
| 0:23:04| We also know that if we know how aerosols are produced, we can develop mitigation strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| So how do we lower the risk for our students and our directors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| And then the other thing they found was that time, so how long are you singing or playing, the airflow in the room, what type of instrument are you playing, and how are you vocalizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1394)|
| 0:23:28| So are you singing high-pitched or low-pitched, loud or soft?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| Those all factor into how much aerosols are produced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| And that we can mitigate those risks, we can lower the risk for our students or our directors by using masks, by limiting time, by making sure we're aware of our air systems, and then maintaining distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1415)|
| 0:23:53| So just really quickly, what is an aerosol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| An aerosol is a very small particle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| This just kind of illustrates some of the different sizes of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| A human hair is 100 microns, which is at the far right of the scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| Then you can see where like an asthma nebulizer is there at around 1 micron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1447)|
| 0:24:13| Smoke is around 0.1 or 0.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| A COVID particle, one little tiny COVID, is around 0.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| So this is one of the first charts that the aerosol study group released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1463)|
| 0:24:30| And really what I would like to focus on is the far right column.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| You can see a brown bar and a blue bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| And what we see here is kind of the concentration of particles when you sing without a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| It's very high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| When they mask the singer, that bar drops all the way down to that blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| That blue is about the same as me talking in my mask right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| So singing in a mask and talking in a mask produces about the same amount of aerosol particles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1493)|
| 0:24:59| The other thing about this is this was a very clean room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| They didn't have anything else going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| It was a little box with the measurement instruments in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| And then they sang and they performed into this little box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1508)|
| 0:25:14| So playing in a clean box room, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| But what does this look like outside or indoors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| So they created some computer models to figure out what does this look like when you are singing or playing outdoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1522)|
| 0:25:33| So this, I'd like to kind of show you this bottom left first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| So this is your, this model, this person is facing to the left and the wind is blowing to the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1539)|
| 0:25:49| And they are singing for 60 minutes in that bottom without a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| And you can see even outdoors, the aerosol kind of picks up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| And what they said was that between 30 and 60 minutes, there was exponential growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| It was a lot once you hit that kind of 60-minute mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| And then what we see is when we put a mask on, even outside, there's still some aerosols, but it directs it a little bit more around your face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1564)|
| 0:26:14| And there's a lot less of it behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| The other thing to notice is what's happening at 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| It's very, very different than the 60-minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| And then you can see also at 10 minutes, it's almost negligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| It's just the aerosols are just right around your face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| Also, this person is not moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| They haven't moved their face at all for the 60 minutes in this computer model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| They're just standing very still facing the wind and singing into the wind for 60 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1595)|
| 0:26:42| The other thing I want to note for the entire study is that when they're talking about wearing masks, they're talking about wearing perfect fit medical grade masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1602)|
| 0:26:52| Not the N95s, but rather these kind of masks that I've seen some of you around here with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1612)|
| 0:26:58| And perfect fit means there's no gaps at the top or the sides or the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| Also, cloth masks are fine when we get to the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| But they made sure to keep this constant throughout their study that they were using a mask like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1628)|
| 0:27:16| So now what does this look like inside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| Once again, so this room is about 13 feet by 14 feet in this computer model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1639)|
| 0:27:26| And the person is in the very center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| They're facing to the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| And this is a ventilation system that would be normal in a room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| And you can see after 60 minutes of singing without a mask, no one's moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| There's only one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| You can see how the aerosol concentration builds up in that room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| And then with a mask, you see how it stays just right around the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| And once again, we see the difference between the 60 minute and the 30 minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| That's very important in their study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| Okay, so this is from their latest research, the preliminary results from November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1676)|
| 0:28:06| They made a more comprehensive computer model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1686)|
| 0:28:13| And in this instance, this is a room that is about 40 feet wide, 30 feet across, and then 30 feet high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1693)|
| 0:28:21| The air comes from the top of the room and then exits from the bottom of the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| That's their ventilation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| And in this case, it's assumed that person one, that red arrow, has COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| No one is wearing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| And in this room, there are seven people with one director, seven students, singers, and one director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| And what we notice is that in the bottom, there's a lot of information in the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1721)|
| 0:28:48| And I'm narrowing it down for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| So in that bottom illustration, we see after 60 minutes what that looks like in the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1730)|
| 0:28:58| That's the concentration of the aerosol particles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| And if that person has COVID, those particles have COVID with them, most likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| And what we see for person two and possibly person three, they are in that concentrated cloud, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1746)|
| 0:29:16| With the mask, we see that, and with that ventilation happening, we see that the airflow kind of goes with the mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1756)|
| 0:29:25| It comes up out of the top of the mask and maybe from the sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| But it's not coming out like it is without a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| And in the right little box there, person two is not very much at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1772)|
| 0:29:40| And in fact, what they found was that when you mask that person one, person two is not masked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1780)|
| 0:29:48| Person three, no one else is masked but person one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| When you mask person one, the aerosol concentration is reduced, reducing the risk of infection by 57%, which is a big number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1791)|
| 0:30:02| This is also a clean room scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| In this computer model, no one is moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| The HVAC is brand new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| It is perfectly running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| And that's important to think about with our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| What are the circumstances in our schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| This is an instrumental example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| So they are testing lots of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| They're testing singing, playing instruments, playing lots of different kinds of instruments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| They're also testing theatrical voice and singing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| And then I think they have some, at some point they'll also test dancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| But they haven't started that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| So with instrumental, they're really concerned not just with the person's mouth, but how does the air flow through the instrument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1841)|
| 0:30:49| And in this case, person one has COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| There are seven other students and a director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| They're not wearing masks and they don't have masks on their instruments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1856)|
| 0:31:02| So person one is playing the clarinet with COVID and does not have, it's called a bell cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1862)|
| 0:31:08| It covers up the end of the instrument where the air comes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| And once again, we see in that bottom right corner, when there's no bell cover, there's a lot of concentrated particles coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1871)|
| 0:31:22| And when we cover that bell, we see on the bottom right that it is really, those particles are really maintained very close to the person and it's not traveling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1882)|
| 0:31:32| There's just not as many particles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| And once again, it's very close to the singing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| When the person one's instrument has that bell cover on it, the aerosol concentration is reduced, which then reduces the risk of infection by 56%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1897)|
| 0:31:47| And one thing I wanted to point out here, we don't have very many classes with seven students in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1907)|
| 0:31:55| We have classes more like 40, 50, 60 students in band and choir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| And they move around and we have the air conditioner that we have in our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1920)|
| 0:32:06| So they went through all of these experiments and really from the beginning, but they've clarified as they've gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1926)|
| 0:32:16| They've come up with some guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| And this is from the most recent drop in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| And their guidelines are to mask everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| So if you are a singer, you're an actor, you wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| If you are an instrumentalist, you wear a mask over your mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| If you play something with your mouth, there's a hole in your mask for while you're playing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| And then you also put a mask on your bell cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| And then teachers are also masked in this scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| That you maintain six feet of distance no matter what, because we see that over time those aerosols build up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1967)|
| 0:32:54| And that six feet can really help mitigate those risks of the aerosols that are coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1974)|
| 0:33:00| Timing is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| They suggest that you stick with 30 minutes because of how much aerosols, even when you're masked, come out at the 60-minute mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1982)|
| 0:33:11| So 30 minutes is their time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| If you're outdoors, after 30 minutes you can wait about five minutes for the aerosols to disperse naturally in the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| If you're indoors, you do 30 minutes of performing and you wait 20 minutes where the air can exchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2000)|
| 0:33:27| So it's kind of like a cycle of your air conditioning coming on and the air comes in and goes out to kind of clear the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2007)|
| 0:33:34| They're also really concerned about what is the ventilation like in your room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2014)|
| 0:33:40| Make sure you do hygiene just like all of us do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| But also there's spit valves in band and they used to just kind of dump them on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| And now we make sure we put those in the spit that goes in the trash, not just everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| And that masks are very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| They need to be well-fitting masks as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| So that is the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| Kind of in five minutes, ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| I'm open to any questions if you have them of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| Thank you, Madam Chair and Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| Thank you for that presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| Do you know, have there been any studies for sports like football and basketball?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| I am unaware of studies for athletics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| For athletics, it's not something that I follow typically anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| But I haven't come across any either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| I do know that this study is supposed to cover dance at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| But I haven't seen any examples, any results, any experiments yet on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2078)|
| 0:34:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| There are some studies on gyms specifically that have just come out in the past week or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| that may answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| But I don't know specifically from where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2099)|
| 0:35:05| When the arts department started looking at this study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| how did that impact what teachers were able to do in the fall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| Yeah, so we started at we don't know if we can do this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2114)|
| 0:35:19| So that's where we started our year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| When this came out, we said, okay, we can follow these guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| They're easy to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| So we will stay away from each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2127)|
| 0:35:28| We'll wear masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| All the band groups got bell covers for their bands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| And we've been singing and playing in schools every day for all year safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| And if you didn't have these guidelines, where would you be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| So if we didn't have guidelines at this point, like they disappeared today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2145)|
| 0:35:51| I think we would have one group who would not do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| We would get books out, and we would read, and we would respond to music| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| and write about music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| I have probably another camp that would assume that it's safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2162)|
| 0:36:07| and then they would carry on unsafe practices potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| I think our department is really glad that we have these guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| We want to sing and we want to play, and this helped us feel safe in our classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2176)|
| 0:36:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| So one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| The outdoor case that would be compute – did you have your mic down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| With the computer models, is that based on actual observation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2195)|
| 0:36:41| or just the computer model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| So there's two scientists working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| One is in charge of computer models,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| and one is in charge of collecting actual data from people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| So they work collaboratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| And one set has people in a clean room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| and they're just testing and retesting and retesting what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2221)|
| 0:37:07| when you play this instrument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| what happens when you put a bell cover on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| and they go through all these situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| And that data then goes to the computer model people who use –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| it's in here somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| It's like a Wells-Riley equation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| which apparently has been around for two decades in computer modeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| I'm not an expert in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| That's what I've learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| So they work collaboratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| So it is real data from real singing and real playing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| that then gets sent to the computer people who make their models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| I think the issue that has been raised by parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| is that we're making a lot of policy based on an observational study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| that hasn't been concluded, that hasn't had peer review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| And I think Ms. Henderson raises a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| So we have similar studies in athletics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| and I don't know that I've seen any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| but I think we have case study in our schools that we've had athletics going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| and we haven't had spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| We've had some, but not tremendous spread from athletics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| So I guess it's – I think that's why parents are questioning the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2297)|
| 0:38:24| You know, we've had athletics that we've been successful with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| So, you know, and we've also heard from students who've had –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| I've heard from parents who are concerned about their students breathing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| while they're in a band competition and running and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| So are you concerned about that topic, that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| just with the actual heavy breathing that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| our athletes are not having to deal with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| because they're not wearing a mask that the band student is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| I have not heard from any of my teachers that that has been an issue with breathing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2334)|
| 0:39:01| Also, as far as peer review, if we didn't have the preliminary results,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| we would have been talking in August about we don't know if it's safe to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| So I think we've been really lucky that they've been releasing these results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| And as they've gone through the study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| the results, which are these guidelines, have only gotten stronger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| So when following that research and the progression of it, it has gotten better and better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| I do think we're lucky that we have this data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| It's unfortunate we don't have data on athletics or don't know of that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| And I don't know what those would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| I do have this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| And as someone who's making decisions on behalf of fine arts students and staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| this is something that's really helped us be able to progress and play and sing safely and securely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2386)|
| 0:39:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| Lots of mics all of a sudden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| Okay, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| The packet that you have with you is just this study so that you would have some additional information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2399)|
| 0:40:07| But there are also studies that have been done on aerosol transmission for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2407)|
| 0:40:14| But they're specific to medical facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| They do seem to be similar to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| And I'll be happy to find some of those and pass those on to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| Thank you, Dr. Castile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| Appreciate you coming in and sharing the information with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| I'm not expecting you to be an expert on this type of information related to sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| But I do have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| In the readings that you've done, do you have any sense of whether or not sports activities produce aerosol in the same ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2436)|
| 0:40:43| as playing wind instruments or singing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| Because I think that was a point of this study is to say that in these particular activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| it does something that just talking does not do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| So do you know that by chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| So from the studies, when you are louder, when you are projecting your voice, when you're using more air,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| more particles are expelled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| In athletics, you are moving, you're expelling a lot of air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2465)|
| 0:41:10| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| But to me, the more air that's coming out of you, the more likely it is that you are expelling these particles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2472)|
| 0:41:21| There was a lot of information or some information about vibrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| The more vibrations, the more particles are expelled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| So when you're hitting a really high C, that has a lot more, it's almost off the charts of how many particles are being expelled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2490)|
| 0:41:39| And then our baritones and basses, when they're doing a low C, it's at the bottom of the chart, almost like talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2499)|
| 0:41:46| I wouldn't know about either of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| I can barely play the radio, so it's all good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| But to me, when I started calling around and speaking to different people in the medical field about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2510)|
| 0:41:57| to me, this kind of supports something that I heard anecdotally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| One of the ICU nurses that I spoke to in our local hospital said that 50% of the COVID cases he has seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2521)|
| 0:42:08| is directly related to choirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| And I thought that's an interesting statement to say, man, in that environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| And, you know, they were unmasked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| They were unmasked singing in choirs where they were seeing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| And so, you know, I know that's not scientific, but to me that's a pretty startling observation from an ICU nurse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2540)|
| 0:42:27| Thank you, Madam Chair and Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| You may not know the answer to this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| You know, I hear a lot from parents that are concerned about the long-term implications of wearing masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| especially in athletics or singing or when you're being physical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| Do you know if this study is going to continue to include what those long-term implications may be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2562)|
| 0:42:50| You may not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| I don't think that they're looking at the medical issues of wearing a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| I don't think that's part of their study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| I don't think that they'll include that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| I have one more thing that I should mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| We surveyed our teachers last month about do they want their student performers to wear masks or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| And I think it's important to stand behind what my teachers think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| So we had 118 responses, which is a 76% response rate, which is pretty great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2602)|
| 0:43:28| 106, which is 90%, said that we should wear masks while performing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| And we had 12, which was 10%, say that we should not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| I want to make sure you guys see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| Is that from like K through 12 or is that more high school that you're talking to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| That is K-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| We're singing and playing K-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| So now we will move to preventative educational approaches to community violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| And I would like to introduce our speaker, Andre Cansey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| And he is joining us by Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| So we have him, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| Good, good, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| Cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| Glad to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| Can I just go from there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| I'm just going to share my screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| So one, ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2664)|
| 0:44:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| Get this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| Cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| That'll work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| I'm kind of new to this as far as presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| So if anybody can give me a word of when to wrap up, that would be much appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2680)|
| 0:44:46| So I'll try to do my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| Well, I appreciate everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| It's good to see you all again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| It's been a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| I moved to Louisville actually last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| And I'll talk about that in a little minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| But, again, just glad to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| And also I know it's carrying a lot of weight because of what's been going on the last couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2705)|
| 0:45:12| It is heavy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| It is tense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| And I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| But I'm glad you all are having the conversation from all levels of government, from county commission, city council, and you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2717)|
| 0:45:25| And that is good because once all of these align, we'll get to a good place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2725)|
| 0:45:32| Because what happened the last couple of weeks is not just on one particular school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2732)|
| 0:45:41| It's not just on the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| It's a collective effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| It's letting people know that it's not just you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| It's not just us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| It's everybody in the city and the county and eventually the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| And just also I just saw on Facebook today, today is also Juwan Latham's birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2752)|
| 0:45:59| Juwan was Xavion Dobson's cousin who was killed a couple months after him in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2759)|
| 0:46:07| So just holding him and his family in our hearts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| So we can get through this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| So I'll talk a little bit about Cities United.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| I'll talk a little bit about where we're at right now as far as violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| I'll also talk about ways that you all can intervene as Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| And also some general kinds of ways of violence prevention and intervention that other cities are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2786)|
| 0:46:33| And then really get down to next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| Because really it's going to be about you all partnering with the city and their efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2796)|
| 0:46:41| Also with the county as a whole to really make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| Madam Chair, can I interrupt for just a moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| Andre, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| Yeah, I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| Can you put your presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| And presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| Oh, yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| Same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| Yeah, yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| Oh, so again, that's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| Again, also I mentioned I was also Xavion's mentor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| I also was the co-chair of the DO Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2824)|
| 0:47:10| I was on the original task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| And I was the co-chair of the Implementation Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| So there are some intersections as far as my work, violence reduction, and you all's partnering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2834)|
| 0:47:20| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| So what are Cities United and what we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| It was founded in 2011 by these two gentlemen right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| Former Mayor Michael Nutter and also former Mayor of New Orleans, Mitch Landrieu,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2850)|
| 0:47:36| along with Dr. William Bell out of the Casey Family Programs, and also Black Male Achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| So why was this founded, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| What are we dealing with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| Our vision is creating safe, healthy, and hopeful communities for young black men and their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| And how do we get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| Our mission, that we're a network, and we support a national network of mayors who are committed to reducing the epidemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2872)|
| 0:48:01| I say epidemic for a reason, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| We see community violence as a disease, right, something to be treated like any other kind of disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2883)|
| 0:48:10| This epidemic of homicides and shootings of black men and boys ages 14 to 24, we want to reduce that number by 50% by 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2890)|
| 0:48:21| Though our target population is young black males, we work with cities who deal with violence reduction for all people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2901)|
| 0:48:31| It's just that the black men and boys, as far as their population, homicides are the leading cause of death for young black males in that age group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2911)|
| 0:48:42| Of course, you know, young black people, period, are at the highest as far as disparities and violence, disease, and poverty and everything else, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2922)|
| 0:48:52| And our core values, social justice, equity, youth voice, collaboration, which we'll get into at the end of this presentation, and also innovation, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2932)|
| 0:49:03| And our primary objectives are national movement and field building, culture and capacity building, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2943)|
| 0:49:09| So a lot of times when we work with cities and counties, they have a calling, and that calling is violence reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2949)|
| 0:49:18| But they need some extra tools, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| So, you know, maybe you all have an on-the-ground violence interruption program going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2960)|
| 0:49:27| Maybe you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| Maybe you have a hospital-based intervention, which I'll talk about later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| Maybe you don't have anything, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| We try to help you get there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| This is really based on peer-to-peer learning exchanges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| So basically, what has the city done already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| What has the school done already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| What has been successful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| And how can you all just, in so many words, piecemeal it and tailor it to Knox County Schools as far as the need, as far as the capacity, as far as the partnerships as well, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2985)|
| 0:49:57| So this is our beginning of how we got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| Next, we have our partner cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| We have 130 and counting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| As you can see by the screen on the right, most of these cities are located in the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3005)|
| 0:50:11| As you see, East Tennessee is one of them, and Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| And we want to actually increase that number, really by, like, 500 cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3015)|
| 0:50:22| Knoxville is not an anomaly as far as increased violence, which I'll get to in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| So it just takes a network of all these cities across the country to have a shared language, shared goals, and shared activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3027)|
| 0:50:37| And we just see as partnering with these cities and then partnering with each other is how we achieve those goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3037)|
| 0:50:46| So our whole thing is reimagining public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| So, again, what does it mean to be safe, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| What does it mean to be whole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| And we have three ways of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| That's interrupting the cycle of community violence, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| Let's get into the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| Dismantling systems of inequity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| So as we're dealing with the individual, what are our policies, what are the practices, what are the institutions that are causing the environment for that kind of violence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3066)|
| 0:51:18| No kid, no one, period, the last couple of years and decades, grew up and woke up thinking that I'm going to kill somebody today, I'm going to inflict violence, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3078)|
| 0:51:30| A lot of times it was an environment that caused that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| And that environment is caused by inequities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| So dismantling those systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| And also invest in the sustainability of administrative operational activities to base that capacity building for whatever core group, core organization is already doing the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3100)|
| 0:51:51| And the sustainability is really no matter, you all are good people, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3111)|
| 0:51:56| You all are great people, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| But one day it will be a totally different school board, totally different superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| We all wish we can keep you all forever and ever and ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| But people change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| But as people change, a lot of times the issues are there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| So the sustainability, so something that's in place, regardless of who's in office, regardless of who's sitting in these seats, regardless of the culture, violence prevention, violence intervention, and overall violence reduction will be there no matter who's in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3134)|
| 0:52:31| Next is some stats as far as what we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| The cost of violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| Because this is a moral argument, but also it's very costly when a life is taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3158)|
| 0:52:45| And I see all these stats right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| We're talking about billions of dollars that is lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| And that's just funeral costs, medical costs, lost wages for the families of the victim and the victimizer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3172)|
| 0:53:00| And also insurance premiums go up, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| And that's just not counting the criminal justice system and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| And it affects every facet and every sector of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3187)|
| 0:53:13| It's not just the entire family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| Whole communities are affected by this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3195)|
| 0:53:19| So in the sense of economic cases as well, right, to save lives will not only save you money, it will increase revenue because we have more people, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3199)|
| 0:53:32| You have more people, the economy will go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| The economy will go up, and we're all good, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| So this is the economic case to speak about what we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| Next are some theories as to why the rise in homicides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3222)|
| 0:53:48| Because, again, there's a lot that was happening in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| It's happening across the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| And there are some theories as to why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| And these theories were drafted by a professor, Richard Rosenfeld, out of St. Louis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| He's a criminology professor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| And this is not a coincidence as talking about the rise of homicides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3246)|
| 0:54:13| And his conclusions were that COVID and attacking COVID, right, so treating it, you know, having proper social distancing, like everything to do with COVID, once you attack that, that's a way to address the rise right now, right, because there's intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3253)|
| 0:54:34| And sometimes the face of COVID, as we see, is some insane people also being affected the most by the violence, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3274)|
| 0:54:41| So there's an intersection as far as, like, who is the face of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3281)|
| 0:54:46| The rise of violence also coincides with recent protests, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3286)|
| 0:54:52| Last year, we all know what has happened last year with police violence in terms of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3292)|
| 0:55:03| Well, that rise and that tension mixed in with COVID and the economic stress because people are off work, people are doing virtual meetings at virtual schools, the mental health that comes into it by being isolated and not seeing your loved ones and your friends and everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3303)|
| 0:55:24| It's causing this tension for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| And that results in violence, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| So you have the isolation, economic stress of COVID, but you also have the stress and the tension also from, like, you know, like racial issues from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3329)|
| 0:55:39| And as he said, that these violence reduction strategies and police reforms will, in a sense, alleviate some of the rise of violence and social unrest, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3339)|
| 0:55:53| A lot of times, this is happening just not in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| And it is national, sometimes global.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| All of these connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| This is our approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| We have two approaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| So how do we stop people from dying today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| So basically, one of the immediate strategies, immediate programming that a city, county, and a school can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3372)|
| 0:56:20| And it deals with life after prison, incarceration, hospital-based intervention, and that's a partner with a hospital, street-level intervention, which I'll get to in more detail, also group violence intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3380)|
| 0:56:35| Basically, it's dealing with individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| So it deals with interrupting, which means that how do we stop the violence, like, right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3398)|
| 0:56:44| So is any kind of beef, anything boiling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| How can people intervene before there's any violence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| But also, after violence occurs, what happens then, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| So diversion and alternate pathways, crisis response teams, stuff like that, which I'll get into as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3414)|
| 0:57:01| And then also long-term strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| How do we stop the bleeding and the dying from the near future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| And that deals with systemic and institutional changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| And as you see, you all at the top, education, workforce readiness and employment, the criminal justice system, family supports, and community engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3434)|
| 0:57:25| I know in Knox County that the criminal and juvenile justice kind of system, education, they both are kind of housed in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3445)|
| 0:57:35| And I also want to point out the community engagement that in our public health approach, they are the center of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3455)|
| 0:57:42| They're at the center of not only the beneficiaries of these programs, these initiatives, but they're also the drivers, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3462)|
| 0:57:49| So it deals with mechanisms for input, mechanisms for accountability, also mechanisms for leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3469)|
| 0:57:59| So just a little bit of history of Save Our Sons, Cities United, and our partnership, which is now Empower Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3479)|
| 0:58:07| We've been partnering with Knoxville for a couple of years since the first—we have national convenings, and our first one was in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3487)|
| 0:58:17| I was actually on that cohort when I was a youth organizer. I was a youth advisory member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3497)|
| 0:58:24| And Knoxville was also a host of our national convening in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3504)|
| 0:58:31| It was hosted and housed a lot at the Change Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| So what's going on right now, again, as prompted with everything that's been going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3515)|
| 0:58:41| we're now at a place of really investing in violence reduction that goes apart with a million-dollar commitment from the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3521)|
| 0:58:53| through Empower Knox, which that's what Save Our Sons transitioned to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| So it was Save Our Sons that transitioned to Empower Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| So that investment is there. That commitment is there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| So I think it is a rallying call and a chance for everybody to galvanize around this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3544)|
| 0:59:10| And a lot of times, putting your money where your mouth is is a way to alleviate that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3550)|
| 0:59:16| So it just talks about the commitment and priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| It's saying that these kids are our kids, no matter where it happened, who was affected, the city's behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3559)|
| 0:59:27| And today, even before today, I know the county and the county schools are also behind us, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3567)|
| 0:59:34| This is a little of our national programming. I won't go too deep in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3574)|
| 0:59:39| So I do the national programming as well as city outreach and engagement that deals with Peace Challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3579)|
| 0:59:46| that's partnering with cities and community-based organizations for crisis response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| We deal with young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| We have a fellowship, 18- to 24-year-olds, a six-to-month, eight-process of learning and applying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3593)|
| 1:00:00| They taught two Stacey Abrams last year, which was really neat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| I kind of fanned out too, you know, but it was really for their benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| And a Roadmap Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| It's like a more intimate way of really getting people involved in city planning and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3609)|
| 1:00:17| And that's all of our programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| That's all of our programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| So next, we'll go to a little bit, and then we'll go to Q&A after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| It's a little bit about what you can do for education. I'll stop right there for any kind of Q&A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3627)|
| 1:00:36| It's a comprehensive public approach when it comes to education and violence prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3636)|
| 1:00:42| You have to acknowledge and disrupt the pathways of juvenile criminal justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3642)|
| 1:00:46| It also deals with the school-to-prison pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3646)|
| 1:00:50| I know you all have the DEO Task Force and trying to intervene and reduce the disparities, which I was also on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3650)|
| 1:00:58| And there's a clear relationship between youth involvement in violence, and it deals with low educational outcomes, and the juvenile justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3658)|
| 1:01:10| So a lot of times, the victims and the victimizers and the communities most affected, they were also pushed out at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3670)|
| 1:01:20| So intervening in school discipline, in school outcomes, and dismantling those disparities, that will get you where you want to go as far as violence prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3680)|
| 1:01:33| So I'll stop right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3693)|
| 1:01:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Andre, for being here and presenting on CityUnited and the work that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3703)|
| 1:01:50| My goal for this presentation is that I know that we, as school board, are in the business of education and academics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3710)|
| 1:01:58| It's just unfortunate that it also has paralleled into public safety as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| And so my goal for this presentation is for us to just continue to have a lens of all the decisions that we make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3721)|
| 1:02:10| and have a lens that violence and community violence is an approach that we can eliminate from the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3730)|
| 1:02:18| or attempt to eliminate from the beginning from an education approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| So just opening our minds to the lens of what can we do when we're doing programming, when we're funding these opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3741)|
| 1:02:28| when we're having this curriculum, to incorporate the need to educate our kids on the importance of community violence and what not to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3748)|
| 1:02:36| And so that is the ultimate goal of presenting, Andre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| And as you know, if you've been reading, he will also be working with the city and the mayor's office to do the actual implementation that they're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3759)|
| 1:02:46| But my goal as school board is to always have that lens that this does affect our schools, even though it's a public safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3766)|
| 1:02:53| Thank you, Ms. Satterfield. Any other questions, Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| Yeah, I have a question, and I see Ms. Welch is also here. It might even be for her, but, Andre, with the Cities United,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3776)|
| 1:03:03| I mean, I know we're right now all dealing with a crisis that's going on and a lot of violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3783)|
| 1:03:08| What we're doing with the city, is it more trying to deal with the program, I mean, the problem right now, and stopping it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3788)|
| 1:03:16| or as we're moving forward, how do we prevent in the future, or both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3796)|
| 1:03:21| And Ms. Welch happens to be here, so she might speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| Great, and thanks so much. Stephanie Welch, City of Knoxville, it's good to see everybody this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| And Andre has been a tremendous partner in Cities United.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3810)|
| 1:03:34| I mean, right now, you saw the three priorities, and, you know, starting with stopping, interrupting violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3814)|
| 1:03:40| So we have a lot of investments across the city in addressing equity and making sure that there are really good enrichment programs, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3820)|
| 1:03:49| But right now, we have to stop the violence, and that's what we're focused on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3829)|
| 1:03:55| And Andre, in his expertise with Cities United, will be a key partner in that effort. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3835)|
| 1:04:01| Thank you, nice to see you here. Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3841)|
| 1:04:07| Thank you, Madam Chair. Andre, thanks so much for being with us tonight, and I respect that you didn't want to drive down from Louisville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3847)|
| 1:04:14| and got to join us on Zoom. I am curious, Andre, if you all have seen this in other communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3854)|
| 1:04:22| I mean, obviously, we have three young people, you know, Justin and Stanley and Genaria, all from the same school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3862)|
| 1:04:28| and different circumstances, different situations that, you know, were murdered in the last month and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3868)|
| 1:04:35| And obviously, the school that they all attend was heavily associated with those instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3875)|
| 1:04:40| And I know that sometimes, I think in communities, when there's a concentrated amount of violence that everybody becomes aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3880)|
| 1:04:50| sometimes violence remains hidden, but obviously this is not, that sometimes there's knee-jerk reactions that have unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3890)|
| 1:04:57| And I'm curious, from your perspective with Cities United, are there things that we need to be really thoughtful about not doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3897)|
| 1:05:04| as Knox County Schools in any type of response or way that we're trying to support our young people and our administrators and educators?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3904)|
| 1:05:13| Yeah, appreciate that, appreciate that. What I would suggest, kind of immediate, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3913)|
| 1:05:21| Because, you know, a lot of times it's immediate responses and also short-term responses and long-term kind of sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3921)|
| 1:05:30| So, as far as the schools, you know, I've seen that too, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| So, I think one is how do you frame the conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| So, framing the conversation meaning that the students, the principals, the teachers, they're centering the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3939)|
| 1:05:47| So, which means that the children, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| So, I think it's asset-based framing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3950)|
| 1:05:54| And not just on Austin East, but the people around it, right, the people surrounding Austin East as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3954)|
| 1:06:01| So, framing the conversation, that could be a collaboration with schools, community-based organizations, young people as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3961)|
| 1:06:10| because I know the student leadership in Austin East and also the school board student rep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3970)|
| 1:06:16| as a way to kind of collaborate on any kind of framing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3976)|
| 1:06:20| So, this is what we're dealing with right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| Also, elevate the beauty of Austin East, the people, the places, the pathways that you went to Austin East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3982)|
| 1:06:31| You did a lot of great things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| So, one is the framing conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| It'd be an asset-based framing and not, you know, not a narrative that it's just Austin East, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=3995)|
| 1:06:42| That they're the anomaly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| And not having them as the anomaly because it'll lead to bad perception, bad policy, and bad practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4004)|
| 1:06:51| We want to avoid that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| So, centering them and also collaboration with, I know you have New Sentinel, you have media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4013)|
| 1:06:58| but most importantly, the students, the teachers, and the surrounding communities collaborate on some kind of framing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4018)|
| 1:07:05| that can be in the forms of op-eds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| It could be the form of newsletter campaigns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| It could be the form of social media, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| And that's where the young people come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| They know how to use social media very well, a lot of times better than adults, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4037)|
| 1:07:22| Because they're not as combative, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| But also, where's the healing at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4045)|
| 1:07:29| So, the immediate kind of response is the healing for young people, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| So, I think there's also efforts to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| But school-wide, school-wide, school-wide, city-wide is to have some healing, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4056)|
| 1:07:43| So, let's get into counselors, mental health professionals, clergy, community members, mentors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4063)|
| 1:07:51| Let's have a collective effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| So, before we get into any kind of planning, there needs to be some healing, immediate healing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4073)|
| 1:08:00| I remember how it was when Xavier Anjuan died and that wave of violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| It was very hard, right? Very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| We have to center healing in that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| So, before we get into what we're going to do, which we'll get into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4089)|
| 1:08:14| but it's also to center the kids in framing and healing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4094)|
| 1:08:19| And that's the collaborative effort with everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| And collaboratively with everybody else, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| So, community members, again, faith-based people and young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4106)|
| 1:08:30| So, those are immediate steps right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| But again, I'll put everything a little bold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| The framing and communication kind of strategy, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| Between the schools, aid, students, parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| So, how to frame the conversations we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4121)|
| 1:08:44| Also, looking at the families of the people that were affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| All three of those kids and their families, they were good kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| They need to be framed, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| But also, the healing aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| Whatever resources, people that can be in these schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| that can be in these environments, neighborhood associations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4137)|
| 1:09:02| wherever you can house people to have these conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| Not just vent, but the process will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| I really appreciate you speaking about being asset-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| And obviously, I know in the work that you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| it's not about ignoring the deficit, but it's about centering it on the asset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4154)|
| 1:09:18| and bringing solutions from what's already good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| what's already beautiful in that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| Does Cities United, or do other entities that you all have aligned with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4161)|
| 1:09:27| or partnered with, help specifically in the context of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4167)|
| 1:09:33| in the cities that they're in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| One of the reasons why I say that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| I know I've heard Superintendent Thomas say several times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| in the last few weeks about how he wants to see action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| He wants to see something change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| And I think when he says that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| I'm not trying to speak for you, Superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| but I think he means he wants to try to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4189)|
| 1:09:53| what are the appropriate ways as a school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| that we need to be helping keep our kids safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| So are you all doing that type of work as you're working in cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| or are there others that we need to be looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| A lot of times, that's the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| That's the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| So a lot of times we work with cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| so we have stakeholders, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| Well, we suggest stakeholder groups, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| So those are the groups that's kind of steering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| implementing the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| but also deal with policy and practice recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| And that's kind of where the schools can get into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| So what can, what would be the beauty of this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| once we get to it, is the city and the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4231)|
| 1:10:35| and above that, the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| is all be at the same kind of stakeholder kind of group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4238)|
| 1:10:41| There's been examples of city councils| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| and there's been examples of city-county-based partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| Houston with Harris County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| King County, where Seattle is at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| southern King County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| Allegheny County, which is in Pennsylvania,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| that's where Pittsburgh resides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| because it aligns resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| it aligns language, so shared language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| So you all, the city, county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| are all saying the same things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4271)|
| 1:11:12| That's the framing part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| But also, if the allocated resources are from you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| there's also a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| But also collective kind of advocacy, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| So ideally, we want this to be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| that the state should also be paying attention to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| so that kind of regional kind of partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| But we encourage every city who works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| on these kind of comprehensive public safety plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| as part of the stakeholder kind of activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| is to bring the schools in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4299)|
| 1:11:40| because as I said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| the school-to-prison pipeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| is at the intersection of violence reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| If those disparities are decreased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| as far as discipline and outcomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| then most likely, with everything else in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| you will get that reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| And these are evidence-based strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| that has happened in other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| I said it happened in Minneapolis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| Seattle, Los Angeles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| I have various other examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4326)|
| 1:12:07| But again, that partnership with the cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| how to intervene, that is key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| So that partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| you all have to work in tandem with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4335)|
| 1:12:18| Of course, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| there's a point to where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| governance and decision-making,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| we'll get down that bridge when we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| But the key is having everybody there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| for, again, collective advocacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| collective effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| and collective mission, vision, and activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| Sorry, one last question, Andre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| I really appreciate your comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| about alignment, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| Have you all formally had any...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| I know you've worked for a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| with the city many years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| Has there been any conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| with our partners in county government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| with Cities United yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| Well, a lot has been up to you all, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| So, you know, a lot of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| is once these kind of stakeholder groups...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| You know, we have six milestones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4380)|
| 1:13:01| when it comes to planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4381)|
| 1:13:04| a comprehensive public safety plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| One is the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| So what is the story in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| So not just the bad stuff right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| just the shootings and homicides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| but the asset security, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| The schools, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| The community-based organizations, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| The project reds, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| The people and places doing the work, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| Like you all, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| You all the assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| But also with that kind of group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| And I may...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| The question may have been getting ahead of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| Repeat that one more time as I go into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| Andre, I was just curious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| if you all had already had some conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| with counterparts with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| A lot of that will be kind of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| Those kind of conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| is kind of going to be that kind of outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| I mean, this is part of the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| as far as like the more formal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| kind of execution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| of getting other county members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| It just won't be what the city is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| But also, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| you all have conversations, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| on and off, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| But I think once this core group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| has kind of started, I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| whether in power knocks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| or community engagement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| whoever the core team should be formalizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| those kind of outreach efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| But I can suggest right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| who should kind of be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| as far as that table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| is schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| criminal justice systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| So, you know, it means the DA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| but also, you know, the jails, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| But it's also county commission, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| So county commission, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| to have that kind of policy, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| and resource kind of intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| But a lot of those engagements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| are really going to be from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| more than us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| We're going to suggest it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| This is what you should do, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| This is what has worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| And of course, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| you all can have conversations in between that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| but the more formal kind of outreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4501)|

| 1:15:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| Thank you so much for joining us this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| Good to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| All right, we'll move now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| to our discussion of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| March 10th regular session agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| Board members, since the agendas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4526)|
| 1:15:28| for our March meetings were published,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| you have received several updates via email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| Detail for item 8C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| the ESSER 2.0 grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| has been attached to your electronic agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| The caption on the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| for construction of the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| Northwest Sector Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| was updated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| and the contract attached for item 9E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| And for item 10A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| the lease agreement with the barbershop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| located near our Hardin Valley Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| has been attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| So those are the updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| So we will move into discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| on items and contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| Any questions or comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| on one or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4565)|
| 1:16:12| Three or four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| I have a question on number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| Is Brady Cox still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| As we do this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| the first year is at no cost, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| Does that tie us into consecutive years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| or is it an option after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| So it's definitely an option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| that we can bring back before the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| Since this is a new organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| they really need to show some value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| So I don't want to say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| yes, we're signing on automatically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| so we can bring that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| Any questions on five or six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4617)|
| 1:17:02| Seven or eight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4622)|
| 1:17:06| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| On seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| and my intent was to get this answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| before this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| but I think that contract states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| something about the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| to host events somewhere around 420,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| which is a lot in that particular event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| And so I'm just curious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| if we have any concern about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| and if our policy speaks into that type of event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4651)|
| 1:17:35| related to our COVID public health guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| that we're following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| So you're questioning the number of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| in that venue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| and the spacing sort of conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4666)|
| 1:17:47| And frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| again, I meant to get this answered ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| I'm not quite sure exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| how our policy speaks into those off-site events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4674)|
| 1:17:57| at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| Anyone like to jump in here, Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4681)|
| 1:18:07| Mr. Myers, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| Thank you, Madam Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| I'll do my best to try to answer the specific questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| In order for the contract to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| we would need to be operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| under whatever restrictions the county may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| So that would be on the event centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| and to ensure those safety protocols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| On our end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| we don't have anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| that would necessarily restrict that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| We would encourage our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| to follow the same protocols| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| we'll be following for our problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| I can also add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| that a release has been prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| for each of the high schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| that have decided to do a prom this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| which this would be one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| And the release goes into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| the same protocol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| that the schools are following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| In other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| if the temperature checks are still in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| which looks like they may be going away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| that would be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| But obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| you would have the extra hand sanitizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| that would also be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| the parent or the student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| if the student's 18 or over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| would also be signing the waiver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| saying that they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| that they're not sick, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| And then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| they don't have a fever and et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| So that is an extra precaution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| that's being taken as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4775)|
| 1:19:36| Thank you, Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| Any questions on nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| And then we move into board policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| I believe that all our policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| are second readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| Do we have any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| on any of these board policies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| I have one on D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| In looking back at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| I believe the note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| that we've put on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| let me see where it went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| It's tiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| The note we put on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| is March 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| But I believe the governor's order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| is longer than that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4815)|
| 1:20:17| Is it, should we change this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| so that it does not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| a definite date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| Can you speak to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| Yeah, which line are you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| If you go all the way to the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| the red section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| Oh, at the very, very end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| So it references| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| the executive order dated March 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4835)|
| 1:20:42| And let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| And that is referenced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| on what line above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4846)|
| 1:20:54| I think Mr. Dupler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| may be able to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| So Governor Lee's executive orders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| have changed throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| I mean, as the pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| has evolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4868)|
| 1:21:09| So our office can certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| modify this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| to reflect that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| whatever the current order is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| that would apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| So would you delete the dates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| We could, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| we could leave some of the dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| certainly as far as when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| the orders came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| But I think Ms. Owens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| referring to the last dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| down where it talks about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| 2020 to February 27, 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| We could simply indicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| whatever time period these apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| Is there a way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| Because, I mean, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| we're going to vote on this policy next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| And it seems like we have no idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| when these orders are going to stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| that maybe it's we just reference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| the current, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| something more generic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| than a specific dated one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| that we are just going to abide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| by and I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| if we could do something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| Because I do see to Ms. Owens' point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| he's going to keep putting things out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| in dates and they're going to keep expiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| Yeah, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| We can put in there that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| you know, whatever the current order is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| that would allow this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| That's what we would refer to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4952)|
| 1:22:33| So we'll get some updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| Okay, great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| Anything else on policies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| Did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| Okay, we'll move to grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| Questions on A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| Yeah, I had a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| and I don't know who to ask this of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| First off, a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| I think I'm on the right one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| This is about connectivity advices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| and I'm having trouble with my computer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| getting stuff up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| Probably a little bit of my question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| has expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| I mean, it almost seemed like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| this was all supposed to have been done by December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| So if you can just kind of generally talk to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| how are we getting devices out to people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| that kind of stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| and then speak to the date issue too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| So this is a grant that Laura Denton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| our grants director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| applied for back in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| and we were actually awarded in September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| and we were just notified in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5006)|
| 1:23:29| So it's one of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| congratulations, we've sent you a check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| and we said yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| we would love to take that check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| And all dates have expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| So this covers about six months worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| of the hotspots that we're issuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| to our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| So from basically August through December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| is what we're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| this will cover the cost for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| Okay, so we're basically just retroactively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| paying ourselves back for hotspots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| Yeah, we have already paid those bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| this is just kind of truing up that account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| And can I just ask you more on the connectivity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| the hotspots that we've put out there for people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| are they forever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| Are they short term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| I don't even know how hotspots work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| So we're trying to look at them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| in a lot of cases as a short term solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| We've given out 516 Comcast codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| in our partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| with the Knox Education Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| So we're really trying to get students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| that wired, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| high speed connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| to hotspots all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| But there are some instances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| especially out in our Carter community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| where connectivity doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| So a hotspot is the only option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| Okay, and I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| do you have a sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| are we planning on continuing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| I would anticipate that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| some type of hotspot deployment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| in the fall as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| But we really are trying to partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| and get those folks that high speed connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| So I think it's still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| Our role, we're still trying to figure out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| you know, what hotspot business we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| But we're trying to find better options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5102)|
| 1:25:05| Well, I know when all this first started happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| I know the chamber kind of took the lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| on something where we were having conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| with our partners in the community on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| Did anything ever come of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| I mean, like...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| That's the partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| with the Knox Ed Foundation and Comcast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| so that we can get families that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| you know, cost assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| for low or no cost internet access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| in their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5127)|
| 1:25:28| There's also some funding coming out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| through the last round| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| of the stimulus package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| that's going to be directly to families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| So we're still waiting on guidance from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| But that'll be another opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| for folks to kind of subsidize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| internet cost at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5149)|
| 1:25:51| So Ms. Babb asked the original question that I had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| but I also think it would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| I'm assuming you all have access to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5155)|
| 1:25:56| I'm just wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| in terms of how many families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| have we successfully helped connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| and get online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| and also if there's any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| if we are aware of any deficits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| where we still have some gaps there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| I'd love to get a sense of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| And also to wired versus any kind of hotspot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| I'd just like to try to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| the total impact that KCS has had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| in that space as we've tried to help assist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| I mean, currently we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| we've purchased about 1,300 total hotspots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| About 1,000 of those are out in circulation now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5186)|
| 1:26:29| So it ebbs and flows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| Obviously our biggest month was December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| when we went red for that week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| We had a lot of people raising their hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| looking for some assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| So currently we're at about 1,000 hotspots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| and we kind of go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| Do you have a sense of whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| there's still families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| that we just haven't been able to support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| We're still getting requests every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| We may only hear from one or two families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| Some days we may hear from 10 or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| And we're trying to kind of gather information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| as we talk with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| to see what challenges they're trying to overcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| Any other questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| Okay, and moving to the Grant B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| from the Builders Exchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| Okay, or C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| Moving to Contra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| Yes, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| I'm assuming this is correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| but the way this reads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| it says approving receipt of the funding on C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| I'm assuming that in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| if we do approve that this coming week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5259)|
| 1:27:42| we're also approving the allocation plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| that the district has formulated, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| We are approving both things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5268)|
| 1:27:50| if we should approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| So what we will do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| we understood the direction we were going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| and then the board agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| because we haven't filed the application yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| Which is due the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| It's due the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| And so what we will do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| is once we file the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| we will bring that back to the board for approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5290)|
| 1:28:12| but that application will align| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| with what we presented tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| So what are we exactly being asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| to be approved on C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| This is just the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| This is just approving the grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| to the receipt of the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| And then in that application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| we will know what our plans are for spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| Then we will bring that back to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| and essentially at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5312)|
| 1:28:34| the board is approving the spending plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| Okay, so the board will have another opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| to approve the spending plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| Great, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5322)|
| 1:28:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| Okay, anything else on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| Moving to contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| Any questions on one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5332)|
| 1:28:54| two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5338)|
| 1:29:01| Ms. Owen, did you have a question on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5341)|
| 1:29:04| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5344)|
| 1:29:06| Okay, five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| What am I on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| I'm so lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| I don't think I got enough sleep last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| Okay, did anybody have a question on D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| I don't know if I said D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| Any questions on the ones prior to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| Okay, E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| I guess this is D and E together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| Since we have some new board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| could someone talk to us about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| school construction bid processes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| I'll start this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| and if we need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| Mr. Dillingham can come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| and bail me out or fill in the gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| I wanted to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| both of these contracts anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| If we talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| we can talk about them simultaneously, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5395)|
| 1:29:58| If you look at the Adrian Burnett contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| which is 9D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5400)|
| 1:30:06| our budget for Adrian Burnett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| was $19 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| If you look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| that base contract comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| for just over $19 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| What you're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| in the recommendation there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| is $19.9 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5421)|
| 1:30:22| almost $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| That includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| what we call alternates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| in the bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| We bid it for the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| of the school for a capacity of 600| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5434)|
| 1:30:36| and then the first alternate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5436)|
| 1:30:38| was an additional two classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| and then the second alternate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| was two more classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| and the third alternate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| was two more classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| and the fourth alternate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5448)|
| 1:30:50| was demolition of the existing building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| We're going to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5452)|
| 1:30:54| another of those alternates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| so that we'll take the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| up to a capacity of about 800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| We'll add an additional six classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| and we'll get the existing building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5462)|
| 1:31:04| torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| We got really good pricing on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| If you look at the bids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| that we got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| on the classroom alternates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| they're significantly less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5474)|
| 1:31:16| than we would pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| for a portable classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| It will never be less expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| and that does take us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| a $19.9 million cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| on this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| and our original budget projection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| was $19 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| It also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| so it's over what our budget projection was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| We're going to have to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| to the board when we present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| the FY22 capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| and ask for some additional appropriation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| and funding in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| to just pay for this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| but we'll also have to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| for some additional funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| because we now have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| no budget for furniture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| fixtures, equipment, security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| and those kind of items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| so we'll have to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| and add those into the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| The next contract on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| which is with Tricon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5529)|
| 1:32:11| which is a contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| we haven't worked with before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| so it will be very interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| to work with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| is for the Northwest Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5539)|
| 1:32:20| and you'll see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| or Northwest Elementary School rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| and you'll see that bid came in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| at just over $23 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| Well that $23 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| includes an alternate as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| The base bid that they gave us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| was about $21.9 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| and then an alternate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| for eight additional classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| is $1.1 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| which is a similar cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| per classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| that we experienced in the bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| that we got on Adrian Burnett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| and add those eight classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| to this project now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| which will take the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| to a capacity of slightly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| over 1,000 students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| when it opens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| so we'll be in good shape there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| This is another interesting too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| We've already talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| in the past when the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| approved the purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5594)|
| 1:33:15| we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| a road improvement project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5597)|
| 1:33:18| and the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| and we're estimating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| that our cost on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| would be about $2.5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| so if you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| what's in this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| $23 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| add $2.5 million to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| and then come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| and add more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| for furniture, fixtures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| and equipment and security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| and the other amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| that we need to finish out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5626)|
| 1:33:47| will be in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| of $29 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| and we'll have to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| and talk about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| when we bring the FY22| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| capital plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| The interesting thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| on these two projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| as well as the Lonsdale project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| is the bids are coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| very similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| to one another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| meaning that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| over what we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| originally projected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| but they're over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| in the same ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| and in roughly the same amounts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| so we don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| there's anything out of line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| with the bid process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| and the way they come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| We can also tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| and this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| that we struggle with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5677)|
| 1:34:38| when we develop projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| in the capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5680)|
| 1:34:42| and we're projecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| for out years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5684)|
| 1:34:45| what our costs are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5685)|
| 1:34:47| Do you budget for what you think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| your costs might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| in three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| when you actually get around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5693)|
| 1:34:55| to building the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| or do you go somewhere in between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| and we try to go somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| in between but you never know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| what the construction market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=5705)|

| 1:48:28| Actually, I just kind of want to ask questions and if it's okay, I'd like to email all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6508)|
| 1:48:33| you at the end and kind of hear feedback from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6513)|

| 1:48:44| She's in over the arts program is how I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| So she doesn't really have any medical degree or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6527)|

| 1:48:59| So my question is, would it not have been better to have a medical professional here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6539)|
| 1:49:03| maybe from even both sides to go over the study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6543)|

| 1:49:26| How do you feel about this study not being peer reviewed or even concluded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6566)|

| 1:49:39| Should we not take into account the age range we're talking about, 5 to 18-year-old kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6579)|

| 1:49:54| So why are we so afraid of them playing instruments and performing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| I'm not naive enough to say that there isn't info from both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6598)|
| 1:50:01| There's studies saying that it works, it doesn't work, the aerosols go this far or that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6601)|
| 1:50:07| But in your position, aren't you supposed to remain neutral and listen to all of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6607)|
| 1:50:13| data, take all of the data into account, and then come to common ground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6613)|
| 1:50:17| If it's okay, I'd like to send you all this in an email and I'd love to hear back some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6617)|
| 1:50:22| of the responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6622)|
| 1:50:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6623)|
| 1:50:24| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6624)|
| 1:50:27| Rebecca Reeves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6627)|
| 1:50:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6631)|
| 1:50:34| And then after her, we're going to have Debbie Stafford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6634)|
| 1:50:50| If you'll just state your name and county of residence, and then you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6654)|
| 1:50:55| My name is Rebecca Reeves and I'm from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| Today, before I start talking about the Colorado study, I want to begin by reading a list of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6658)|
| 1:51:02| the names of all of the children in Knox County who have died from COVID so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6662)|
| 1:51:06| I'm going to read their names one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6666)|
| 1:51:07| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6667)|
| 1:51:08| I believe our policy is that we cannot address specific named people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6668)|
| 1:51:13| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6673)|
| 1:51:14| And I'm not going to be naming anybody because there's no one to name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| So that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6678)|
| 1:51:19| Basically, I'm not going to talk about any names because between the ages of zero to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6679)|
| 1:51:24| 17 in Knox County, out of 97,000 children, we have not had one single death, yet we treat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6684)|
| 1:51:30| our children as walking death traps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| Yes, they can test positive and perhaps pass it to a family member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| So let's talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6696)|
| 1:51:38| In Knox County, the age group belonging to the ages of 18 through 44, that year group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6698)|
| 1:51:44| we only had 11 deaths out of a population of 173,000 in that age group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6704)|
| 1:51:49| I would like to know if people are aware of these stats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6709)|
| 1:51:53| Are we telling people that we have only had 11 deaths in Knox County between the ages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6713)|
| 1:51:58| of zero to 44?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| Or is it just fear that we're still selling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| Even with grandparents between the ages of 66 through 74, there have been 130 deaths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6723)|
| 1:52:08| out of a population of 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| So my question is, where is the pandemic in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6730)|
| 1:52:14| We are not New York and we are not California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6734)|
| 1:52:16| And many of us know the truth of what happened there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| I was at the last meeting and the phrase that keeps ringing in my head is, we just can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6739)|
| 1:52:24| take away masks during a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6744)|
| 1:52:26| We must follow CDC guidelines, and I say to heck we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6746)|
| 1:52:30| First, Knox County is not pandemic level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6750)|
| 1:52:33| The second, CDC has been wrong this whole entire time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6753)|
| 1:52:36| Third, we are not doing good because of masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6756)|
| 1:52:39| I've contacted other schools, cities and their school boards, and the ones who do not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6759)|
| 1:52:43| a mask mandate, they are either doing just as good, if not better than us, and we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| actually be following them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6767)|
| 1:52:49| The more restrictions, the worse COVID cases and deaths are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6769)|
| 1:52:52| I'm hearing from medical professionals that COVID patients who are the most ill usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6772)|
| 1:52:56| have a common issue, which is a lack of vitamin D. So instead of masking our band members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6776)|
| 1:53:02| and our choral members, why don't we just pass out vitamin D to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6782)|
| 1:53:06| But of course, we're not going to do that because we're not in charge of anybody else's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6786)|
| 1:53:08| health unless it's about masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6788)|
| 1:53:11| That's the only time that we actually mandate health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6791)|
| 1:53:16| So also, when it comes to this Colorado study, my concern is it's an observational study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6796)|
| 1:53:23| It's not complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6803)|
| 1:53:24| I do not want us to decide anything based on this study because it's not even an RCT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6804)|
| 1:53:31| study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6811)|
| 1:53:32| We would be foolish to use this as anything concrete for our children, and it wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6812)|
| 1:53:36| be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6816)|
| 1:53:37| So who do we listen to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| Last time I was here, we've had doctors come up and they say they're anti-mask or they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6820)|
| 1:53:44| pro-mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6824)|
| 1:53:45| So which ones do we listen to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6825)|
| 1:53:47| Well, a doctor wears a mask, but they don't study masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| They're not trained on masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6830)|
| 1:53:51| And as a matter of fact, people train them on how to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6831)|
| 1:53:55| They have PPE experts, respiratory therapists, industrial hygienists that come in to train| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6835)|
| 1:54:00| them on what mask to wear for what occasion, for what patient they're treating or what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6840)|
| 1:54:04| disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6844)|
| 1:54:05| And it's never for viral transmission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6845)|
| 1:54:07| Masks are not worn to protect you from viral transmission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6847)|
| 1:54:10| They are worn to protect from bacteria going into an open wound or blood splatters going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6850)|
| 1:54:15| into their face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6855)|
| 1:54:16| All the studies done pre-COVID all proved that none of the masks made any difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6856)|
| 1:54:21| in any of the RCT studies that were done as a difference as viral transmission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6861)|
| 1:54:27| So what I'm going to do is tell you who we need to listen to are these two ladies that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6867)|
| 1:54:32| I'm going to give you, Tammy Clark and Kristen Megan, and I urge everyone to look them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6872)|
| 1:54:36| Tammy Clark and Kristen Megan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6876)|
| 1:54:37| They are scientists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6877)|
| 1:54:38| They are OSHA certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6878)|
| 1:54:40| They actually are court certified witnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6880)|
| 1:54:43| They go to court and testify against masks or about masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6883)|
| 1:54:47| They have decades of research between them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| Number one, they are screaming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| Masks do not work against viral transmission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6893)|
| 1:54:55| As a matter of fact, they probably make it worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6895)|
| 1:54:57| They are probably making it worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| Second, masks are absolutely, with any oxygen deprivation you have, it is irreversible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6899)|
| 1:55:05| And I want to repeat that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| Any oxygen deprivation, and especially in our children whose brains are still growing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6907)|
| 1:55:11| they're not even developed, who need full oxygen, we will never be able to reverse that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6911)|
| 1:55:15| on our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6915)|
| 1:55:16| And I want that to sink in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6916)|
| 1:55:17| And it might be small, just like Flint, Michigan water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6917)|
| 1:55:20| When you take a drink of water in Michigan, it's not going to kill you right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| But when you drink it over and over again slowly, it's going to start detergating inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6922)|
| 1:55:27| of your body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6927)|
| 1:55:28| Just like these masks, slowly, a little bit of oxygen decreasing at a time on a child's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| brain who's growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6932)|
| 1:55:33| What memory problems are we going to see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6933)|
| 1:55:36| What types of problems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6936)|
| 1:55:37| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6937)|
| 1:55:38| But band members, and especially choral, when they're singing and all this kind of stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6938)|
| 1:55:44| I used to sing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6944)|
| 1:55:45| I used to do that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6945)|
| 1:55:46| You need oxygen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| And so it really hurts me to think that we could be harming our children in this type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6948)|
| 1:55:53| of a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6953)|
| 1:55:54| And I see that I'm almost out of time, so I really do thank you for your time and consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210303?start=6956)|
