| 0:01:54| The big reveal, let me just put it out there for anyone who might be listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=114)|
| 0:02:01| It says, it's going to be the largest expansion in 44 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=121)|
| 0:02:08| Event too big for one campus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=128)|
| 0:02:11| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=131)|

| 0:02:40| in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| Board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=166)|
| 0:02:47| A couple of announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| I've had some questions about the strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=168)|
| 0:02:51| We will be discussing that at our workshop, January 30th, and we're very hopeful by then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=171)|
| 0:02:58| that we can make some real concrete decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| So, just that's a FYI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| Also, you're going to be receiving an agenda packet in the near future, but just a reminder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=184)|
| 0:03:10| our policy review meeting is going to be next Wednesday, the 23rd, at 1 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=190)|
| 0:03:17| That was the one that was canceled in December because there were so many prior commitments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=197)|
| 0:03:25| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| One other thing I'd like to point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=206)|
| 0:03:29| I was at Northwest Middle School this morning for their ribbon cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=209)|
| 0:03:36| We approved a grant a couple months ago from Planet Fitness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=216)|
| 0:03:44| On opening a workout center that's connected to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=224)|
| 0:03:51| Very exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| And you can see that our wonderful superintendent really got into it, exercising with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=233)|
| 0:04:01| And also, that's Bill Baldwin, the principal of Northwest Middle School next to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=241)|
| 0:04:07| But we had a lot of fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=247)|
| 0:04:09| And I want you to know that we reminded Mr. Thomas that it is a judgment-free zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=249)|
| 0:04:17| So, we had a good time with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=257)|
| 0:04:21| And I appreciate very much any time our community sponsors pitch in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=261)|
| 0:04:28| and let good things like this happen with our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| Changes to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| I think, board members, that you received an email from Ms. Coatney about the following agenda changes or updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=279)|
| 0:04:48| There was a correction to the fiscal note on item 5D4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=288)|
| 0:04:55| The field trip date listed in 7C was corrected, a date correction on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=295)|
| 0:05:01| And you also received two draft versions of legislative priorities via email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=301)|
| 0:05:08| You've got paper copies at your desk, and that's something that we'll be discussing momentarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=308)|
| 0:05:14| And then also, item 9 has been deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| So, having said that, are there any other requests for changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=318)|

| 0:05:58| Is that right, Ms. Coatney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| Yes, Mr. McMillan. That would put it at the top of the regular agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| Right, right. That's what I would like to do, if there's no objection to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=364)|

| 0:11:05| So first off, I'd like to say thank you to Madam Chair and the board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| for giving me the chance to address the board today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| I'm 17 years old, and I'm a junior at Career Magnet Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| I also serve on our school's student government executive board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| and in that role, I do my best to advocate for what my fellow scholars desire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| and I feel it's my obligation to share with the board the reasons that our school should remain open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| I'd like to start with an account of my time at CMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| The opportunities there are amazing for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| We were afforded the chance to take the ACT one year early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| and then take college classes with college professors as a sophomore or junior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| I know personally that I would never be able to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| if I did not have the financial support from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| I would have to receive scholarships to be able to afford even community college tuition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| So this is the reality of many students here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| Not everyone at CMA is affluent, but nobody is denied the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| to take college classes due to financial status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| Additionally, I would like to address a claim from one of the board members during last week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| They mentioned that our school was considered a financial extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| True that may be, but we are vital to this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| as many high schools in the district are either at or near full capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| If our school closed down, it would create quite a strain on the facilities already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| Therefore, either our school needs to remain open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| or the board must face the fact that the existing schools will need expansions and upgrades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=756)|
| 0:12:43| So what does that really say to the other magnet programs in the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| Why does the board choose to fund those as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| It's because you all want to give us as students a variety of choices for our education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=770)|
| 0:12:56| I assure you, CMA is not just an extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| It is a vital choice for students who want to obtain early college credits and who cannot afford them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=780)|
| 0:13:06| We need this school. You need this school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| We will be the next doctors and lawyers and teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| So I ask you, do you want a mediocre class of students or an exceptional one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=793)|
| 0:13:19| One of the other opportunities I've been fortunate enough to have at CMA is to be the president of the French Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=799)|
| 0:13:25| I started this club during my freshman year with a desire to share my love of French language and culture with the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=805)|
| 0:13:32| And this is all done on my own time because we do not have French as an academic class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| Now, the French Club has become a fixture of our school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| and the students in the club learn about the basics of French and are able to use them in our daily lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=820)|
| 0:13:45| Cette école m'a donné beaucoup d'opportunités.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| This school has given me so many different opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| And as mentioned last week, another opportunity I've been granted is the chance to do student teaching in Miss Janet Acosta's Spanish 1 class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=832)|
| 0:14:01| Working with the ninth grade students has given me valuable experience I would never be able to get in a regular high school setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| as I'm working to become a foreign languages teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| This is the type of opportunity I would normally have to wait until my junior year of college to be afforded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| I've spent time planning lessons, teaching the lessons, grading papers, all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| Seeing the growth of these students and their drive to learn has definitely had a positive impact on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=860)|
| 0:14:26| And I will advocate on behalf of their class as well, not just my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| Los estudiantes de esta escuela necesitan su vota.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| The students of this school need your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| That's why I disagree with this sunset option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| The freshman class has not even had a chance to take the ACT yet, and we want to deny them the opportunity to earn college credits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=882)|
| 0:14:49| That's unacceptable in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| Before you vote, please take a minute to understand our teachers and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| Every single staff member at CMA wants to see all of us succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| Every single one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| They all make an effort every day to foster a productive and safe academic environment for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| We often talk about issues in our personal lives with our teachers because they care about us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| They genuinely care about our success, both in and out of the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| Case in point, our college seminar classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| Ms. Hahn advocated for a space for our dual enrollment juniors and seniors to complete work and be able to succeed in their classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=919)|
| 0:15:27| Our dean of students, Mr. Mosley, stays on top of us and encourages us to get our work done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| And we all try to help each other and make sure that we understand the assignments that are given to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=932)|
| 0:15:38| Now, see, that is what's special about Career Magnet Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| We're all one big family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| The students, parents, and staff at CMA deeply care about our school, and we want to see ourselves succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=943)|
| 0:15:51| So in conclusion, I charge the board to extend these same opportunities that I have had to other students by voting to keep our school open and funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=951)|
| 0:16:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=962)|
| 0:16:10| The next speaker is Thomas Hoskins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=970)|
| 0:16:17| Please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| Dear ladies and gentlemen of the board, my name is Wesley Hoskins, and I live in District 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| I decided to start a petition about a week ago that would allow the school board to hear the public opinion on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=986)|
| 0:16:31| This petition has over 1,000 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| It includes many comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| Here are a few of the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| It's a great school for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| Other areas usually get all the opportunities, which I agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| This is beneficial for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| Keep the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| It's from a parent of the students that go to our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| I'm signing because I graduated from CMA last spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| As a current UTK freshman, I begin academically as a sophomore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| CMA is worth the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| Savannah Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| I work at PLCC, Pellissippi Community College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| Strawberry Plains with these students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| It is a great opportunity that should not be lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| Heather White, Pellissippi Councilor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| These are just a few examples of the public opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| Shutting down CMA will take this opportunity from everyone who has worked hard to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| Please consider the people and not just the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| We are students, and we should not be identified by a number or dollar signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| Over 1,000 people have come together to save CMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| Join with us and help make CMA a great opportunity for all Knox County students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1051)|
| 0:17:38| Emily Elgin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| Hello, board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| My name is Emily Elgin, and I'm a resident of Voting District 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| I'm a senior at CMA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| and I have been a member of the student ambassadors and student government at my school for all four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| During these four years, I have seen myself, as well as other students and the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| grow as we have adapted to and overcome all challenges that have been thrown at us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| From changes in administration to funding scares to holding our very first graduation last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1086)|
| 0:18:12| CMA has faced every single one of these seemingly daunting situations with grace and strength.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| It is said that adversity reveals character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| CMA has had its share of adversity, and through it has proved itself to be powerful and resilient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| Before I came to CMA, I was extremely shy and reserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| I was terrified of presenting in class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| I was anxious to talk one-on-one with my teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| and even the idea of talking to the principal or any member of the office made me fearful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1116)|
| 0:18:42| If I told my middle school self that in only a few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| I would be confident enough to speak in front of a crowd of people on a public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| I wouldn't have believed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| When I started high school at CMA, I was immediately met with constant encouragement from all around me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| Although it was still daunting, I felt much more comfortable speaking in class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| The staff didn't make me feel like just some student, but like their equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| And because of this, I knew I'd be able to come to any of them for any help I needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| Many teachers encouraged public speaking in their classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| This was something I was uncomfortable with, and many of my teachers knew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| But they didn't just tell me to get over it or pretend like this problem didn't exist for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| Instead, they acknowledged me and helped me every step of the way to find and build my own confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1163)|
| 0:19:29| My story isn't uncommon for a CMA scholar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| The environment of constant encouragement, care, and attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| is the reason that so many scholars have been able to make such a positive change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| and is one of the reasons that CMA is so unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| We urge you to make the decision to keep CMA open and to make that decision tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| You want us to get our enrollment numbers up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| but it's difficult to do that if the parents of future scholars are fearful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| about the fate of the school they are enrolling their children in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| Deadlines are approaching fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| The window for students to transfer to CMA closes February 16th, only one month from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1202)|
| 0:20:08| And next Thursday, January 24th, will be our first open house of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| We are hoping to see many families attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| and I am hoping those families don't have to be afraid to transfer their students to a great school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| It would be a shame to shut down a school after we have worked so hard to keep it open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| and how hard we are willing to work in the future to keep it going strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| Please make the decision to keep CMA open tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| Thank you. Madam Chair, that concludes my book forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| Moving forward with discussion, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| I just have a question concerning Mr. McMillan's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| When Ms. Hahn originally came to us, it was about changing the name of the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| and I'm just wondering, is that a whole separate vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| Because it doesn't seem like it's covered in the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| So it's more a question of, I guess, does it need to be included in the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1263)|
| 0:21:09| or is that a completely different motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| Maybe Mr. Dupler can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| Mr. McMillan, I see you're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| I purposely did not include it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| Now, it doesn't prohibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| The first part of the motion, as Mr. Dupler read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| allows them to go ahead on the path that they wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| but as far as the actual name change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| I thought maybe that might be something that the board would choose to look at, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1294)|
| 0:21:41| maybe next month or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| That would be a separate item as far as the actual name change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| But I think I'm correct, and I guess I'll ask the superintendent or Ms. Hahn, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1307)|
| 0:21:54| I don't think none of this was intended to prohibit them with establishing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1314)|
| 0:22:02| and changing the programs as they saw fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| Is that correct, Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| Yes, sir, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| And in regard to the name change, I know there's policy that does lay out how that's to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| so it doesn't prohibit CMA from moving forward to do what they wish to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| and then bring it back to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| Mr. Dupler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| And I agree with what Mr. McMillan and Mr. Thomas are saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| but there is a board policy that would require once the procedure is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1350)|
| 0:22:36| then the finalized proposed name would be brought back to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1356)|
| 0:22:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| Other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1367)|
| 0:22:53| I would like to say that I am in a situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| and I know I'm probably not the only board member up here where my head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| and my heart are telling me two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| In my heart, I know that everything everyone has said is genuine and sincere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1390)|
| 0:23:20| and I don't think for one minute that CMA is not a wonderful school in a lot of ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1400)|
| 0:23:33| and certainly without question isn't doing great, great things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1413)|
| 0:23:39| I mean, probably a hundred emails and then all of you showing up to support your school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1419)|
| 0:23:47| I commend you and I applaud you because this is the way it should be if this is your school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| and this is the atmosphere and the attitude that I love to see carried forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1432)|
| 0:24:03| My head is struggling greatly with this, as I said last week, because of the financial implications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1443)|
| 0:24:14| I do struggle with the issue that every student will still receive a quality education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1454)|
| 0:24:26| No student is going to be left uneducated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| Will it look different? Yes, it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| But it is not a matter of denying any of our students the ability to be educated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1474)|
| 0:24:47| Those of us that sat on the board last year through our budget cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| you saw what a very, very painful process it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| We had cutting programs on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| We had cutting teachers and positions on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1500)|
| 0:25:07| It was just extremely, extremely difficult and challenging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1507)|
| 0:25:14| because nobody wants to cut anything, myself included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1514)|
| 0:25:21| So I say all that to say that even though I believe probably the vote will be to continue CMA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1521)|
| 0:25:28| and I cannot support that, it is not because of any of you or because I think CMA is a bad school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1528)|
| 0:25:41| that I don't think it's not a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| I just feel compelled to look at the greater picture for all of Knox County and all fiscally especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1545)|
| 0:25:58| and just feel like this is a painful, very painful decision that needs to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1558)|
| 0:26:11| Any other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| With that said, Ms. Coatney, if we could do roll call and let's start with District 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| Ms. Christy? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1579)|

| 0:26:32| Ms. Owen? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| Ms. Satterfield? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| Ms. Horn? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| Ms. Hill? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| That's eight yes votes and one no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| I am glad CMA will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1606)|
| 0:27:04| All right, thank you. Thank you so much and thank you for your participation in this process very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| Ms. Coatney, moving on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1632)|

| 0:27:23| Motion by Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| Second by Horn. All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1646)|

| 0:27:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| Motion by Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| Did you have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| Second by Owen. Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| I just have a quick question, if I may, on the capital line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| Are these funds surplus from construction projects that are just being moved over or are they needed and being pulled over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1676)|
| 0:28:06| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| Both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| The lines that we're pulling from are the Pond Gap Elementary project that we're closing out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1689)|
| 0:28:17| and then we had some funds left in the roofing line that we need to pull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1697)|
| 0:28:24| And we're pulling these funds into the BEP portable line so that we can move portables that will no longer be needed at NSKIP to other places in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1704)|
| 0:28:39| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| I think you had told us that before and I had forgotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| I was concerned about the roofing, but if it's overage, then that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| Seeing no further discussion, motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1733)|

| 0:29:20| Mr. Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| Last week we tried to give the board a description, at least sort of an outline description of what this position was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1765)|
| 0:29:34| And so the main point today, my main point is just to continue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| Excuse me, I think you're addressing another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1780)|
| 0:29:46| Am I on 8D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| We changed the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1790)|
| 0:29:51| We changed the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| No problem at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| It's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| So reverting back, is there any discussion on the line item transfer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| Item 8E, approve request to add system wide watershed facilitator position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1809)|
| 0:30:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| I'm ready now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| When you all switch the letters on me, I get lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| All right, Mr. Norman, that's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| Motion by Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| Second by Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| And discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| Mr. Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| So last week we tried to get started with a description of this so you all would have somewhat of an understanding or picture about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1831)|
| 0:30:39| I think it's going to take a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| And so that's what I'm trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| We've still got our folks from engineering here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| Chris Gronshue, Roy Arthur, and Stephanie Carlson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| Our science supervisor, Andrea Berry, is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| And, of course, the superintendent, who I think would all speak in support of the position if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1856)|
| 0:31:07| The first thing that I'd like to do is, because the position seemed fairly limited in a way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1867)|
| 0:31:14| I wanted to talk about it somewhat from a historical perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| First of all, the 80K that's in the budget actually represents three positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| It's this facilitator position plus two internships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1884)|
| 0:31:30| And these are people that would be supplied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| The internships are the people who would be supplied to teachers who would affect students directly in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1892)|
| 0:31:43| Roy Arthur and I were talking about the previous coordinator's tenure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1903)|
| 0:31:49| And over the 15 years that she directed this, I think there was probably an average of 12 to 15 schools involved per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1909)|
| 0:32:02| And so there was at least one teacher in each one of those schools, sometimes multiple teachers, that were affected by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1922)|
| 0:32:10| His estimate, and I think he's pretty accurate, was somewhere around, in those 15 years, approximately 20,000 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1930)|
| 0:32:19| So this is not a limited thing at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| I could speak just to my experience as a teacher and as employing the principals of the program in my classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1944)|
| 0:32:35| I know I personally affected at least 5,500 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| So I just used it every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| I used it in almost every class that I taught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| And so it had a dramatic effect on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| And that's really the second part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| I doubt that I would have stayed in education had it not been for this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| We have, as we just got out of this workshop, talked about our problem with retaining teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1978)|
| 0:33:06| I think they said 50% are gone within five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1986)|
| 0:33:12| I'm pretty sure I would not have remained without this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| I think there's a whole lot of life science teachers within the county that probably are very similar to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=1997)|
| 0:33:23| They love their topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| They love their subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| They love to really do all the things that we say is good about schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2007)|
| 0:33:36| Get out of the textbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| Take them into the fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| Do real science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| Hands-on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| All this good stuff that we talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| That's what goes on in the classes that are experiencing this type of program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2025)|
| 0:33:56| So the point that, and we know teachers don't get into education because of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2036)|
| 0:34:03| So what do we do to retain them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| I certainly thought that my longevity was due to the opportunities and experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| that I got sort of indirectly through the partnerships that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| So let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| I attended an international conference on watersheds in Quebec, Canada one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2058)|
| 0:34:25| I had five Oak Ridge National Lab internships in the biology division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2065)|
| 0:34:32| I had three summers of TVA sponsored teacher programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2072)|
| 0:34:41| So all these things were, and I'm just talking about myself, these things were invigorating to say the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2081)|
| 0:34:51| They kept me excited about teaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| And so this is the main thing, I think, for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| It is the value that these programs offer in terms of opportunities and experiences to our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2101)|
| 0:35:11| And so I just wanted to emphasize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2111)|
| 0:35:17| You can't imagine the value of saying, okay, I want to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2117)|
| 0:35:25| and then have two interns come in and say, yeah, I love what you're doing, and I'm here to help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2125)|
| 0:35:36| And you've got 25 kids that you know this cannot be done by yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2136)|
| 0:35:49| So it's just one of those things that it just kept me going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2149)|
| 0:35:57| So that's the main point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| So I'll open it up to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| And, of course, all the folks that we have here are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| So whatever you all think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2174)|
| 0:36:22| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| Just a comment or two in reference to what Mr. Norman was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2185)|
| 0:36:32| Not because of any expertise I have in science, but I did spend over 30 years in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2192)|
| 0:36:41| And I think some things are sort of common experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| And I know from taking field trips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| any time the students can get away from the textbook and get out and truly learn things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2209)|
| 0:37:00| those are things that stick with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| And they remember that years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| I know from two or three things that I did with some of my kids, particularly my government classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2228)|
| 0:37:19| I have occasionally run into people even today that will bring up something about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2239)|
| 0:37:28| I run into them somewhere and they'll say, you remember when we went so-and-so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| And they, you know, it's not that they don't learn stuff out of the book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| but it's when you mention that class or that experience, it comes quickly to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2258)|
| 0:37:48| And in this case, if I understand what's going on this day and time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2268)|
| 0:37:55| I think it's very important to get kids started at an early age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2275)|
| 0:38:02| and hopefully over a period of time that it will spread and be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2282)|
| 0:38:12| maybe contagious is too strong a word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| but it will certainly have an imprint on others as we go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2295)|
| 0:38:23| And I just think it's a worthy thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| It sounds like to me the funding is there already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2306)|
| 0:38:34| And for the number of individuals that you're going to have involved for the amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| it looks to me like it's a bargain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2321)|
| 0:38:49| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| I guess I do have, I mean, what's troubling me about it is not the position itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| I mean, I think that it has great merits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| and Mr. Norman is talking with passion about how much this could benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| but especially after the vote we just had and the discussion just had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2342)|
| 0:39:08| I know there is $81,000, I guess, set aside for this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| but every year we seem to be having these budget issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| And it concerns me that we're looking at adding position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| even though I know there's funding for this year set aside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| and please correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| but it sounds like next year it would be an addition to the budget that, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2369)|
| 0:39:35| I don't think any of us see the light of day with more money coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2375)|
| 0:39:41| So that is just my big concern is not the value of this position at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2381)|
| 0:39:47| just even if it was passed today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| it seems like it would be probably first on the chopping block for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2389)|
| 0:39:56| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| I guess my thoughts are very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| It definitely sounds like it would be beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| I guess my question is, and I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| would the current science staff be able to incorporate this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| the science supervisors be able to incorporate this into what they're already doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| Because they would already have curriculum for the life science classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| Could that be incorporated into what they're already doing, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2425)|
| 0:40:30| would be my biggest question on it, if anybody would like to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2430)|
| 0:40:37| Mr. Thomas, do you have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| Madam Chair, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| I'll be glad to ask Dr. Roswick or Ms. Berry to respond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| since they work on a day-to-day basis with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| But it was, the money, the funding has been there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| like we've talked about, for two years to get this started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| And it was set aside for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| Like I said, it would be the other day, I think, or last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| talked about it being a pilot program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| put some measurements in place for it to evaluate the effectiveness of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2464)|
| 0:41:11| And you're right, if it's a recurring expense, it would have to be in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| But I think, from what I understand, most of what's theirs already will be next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| It will start up, I think, physician-wise, for the next school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| So it would be the following year that it would, if it's approved and if we continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2484)|
| 0:41:30| the budget impact would be the following year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| I guess one other question I would have, you know, when we're looking at the science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| when we're looking at that department, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| is there any possibility that there are any other positions that maybe would be going away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2504)|
| 0:41:49| that could make room for another position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2509)|
| 0:41:56| Of course, Friday is the deadline on the retirement incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| And then once Friday gets here, I think folks have another week to make a decision to rescind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2521)|
| 0:42:08| So what we plan to do is really to look at all positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| and make some assessments about those positions and the need for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| Anything that we can absorb, then that's what we're looking at doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| So I don't know if that answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2543)|
| 0:42:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| And is this something that we need to decide right now, I guess, would be my next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| Well, I think for us, from a curriculum standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| and also get the measurements and things in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| of course, we're going to be running up against next year real quick, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| with almost February being here the next time we meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| So I think in order for things to get started, I believe it would be necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| or important, I guess, for the Board to consider this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| Tony, you were very convincing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| I hear your passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| It does concern me because of the time I've been on this Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| It's very easy to add something, but it's very hard to ever remove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| And it's not been my experience, except with the AVID program maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| that we've, you know, it's just not easy to take something away once it's been given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2601)|
| 0:43:26| and once it's a part of your curriculum, your programming, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| It's just really hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| And it doesn't always matter what the data shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| I saw that last spring, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| So that's just my reluctance in adding a position because I don't want to, down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2619)|
| 0:43:48| have to riff another teacher by adding this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2628)|
| 0:43:54| I mean, that is a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| It is a position that could pay for another teacher or another social worker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| or whatever or for somebody to keep their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| I'm really struggling with this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| I love the value of it, but I just, it's, like I said, it's not easy to ever take away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2646)|
| 0:44:13| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| My concern is with the recurring costs, but I'm curious, does it have to be a full-time position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2657)|
| 0:44:23| I mean, could we do it like on a, pay somebody like on a part-time or as needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2663)|
| 0:44:32| or to come in to these classrooms without making it a, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| it seems like that would stretch that $81,000 a lot farther if it wasn't someone that was there every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2677)|
| 0:44:45| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| I think from looking at the job description there, I believe that there could be some other duties assigned as well as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2688)|
| 0:44:56| So I know, again, maybe it would be better for Dr. Reiswick or Ms. Berry to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2696)|
| 0:45:03| But I think just looking at the job description with the other duties as assigned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| I think if it's a situation where a person could do more, I think we could always use more hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2708)|
| 0:45:14| I know we've tried to look at system-wide positions and absorb as many as we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2714)|
| 0:45:20| But I do think it's a need for it to be full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| But, again, I'll defer to Dr. Reiswick and Ms. Berry to further address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2724)|
| 0:45:33| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| I would just say, you know, in talking, again, some to Ms. Horns as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| our science department, when we look at how we support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| and we talked about the micro-team concept and how we try to support schools around that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| two of our core departments don't have, aren't fully staffed at eight to do that, and science is one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2747)|
| 0:45:53| Our math and our reading ELA, we have eight folks on board so that they can serve each of those groups of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2753)|
| 0:46:00| Science currently has five people, so they don't have the full eight folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| So they're stretched pretty thin in what their load is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2764)|
| 0:46:10| kind of, again, trying to keep up with the other departments that have eight people supporting the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| So as far as the capacity of that full job and what that, you know, Ms. Berry may have more to add to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2774)|
| 0:46:21| but, you know, I think it's harder to tell because the position doesn't exist, so we don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| it's not like we've had it and we can say, well, you know, we could do it with one and a half people or two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| So I think the description as it's laid out right now, you know, Mr. Thomas has mentioned that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2790)|
| 0:46:35| that I think our science team is pretty much at capacity right now to be able to add additional things to their plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2795)|
| 0:46:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| Any other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| I share the same concerns that have been addressed by several other board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| It is not the value of the position because certainly we've got many areas across the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2817)|
| 0:47:08| that could benefit from specialty positions such as this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2828)|
| 0:47:16| The, I keep hearing the word absorbed as we refer back to our retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| and the effort being made to try to actually absorb to be able to reduce some positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2842)|
| 0:47:30| And I just, I just think there's probably never a good time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2850)|
| 0:47:36| but this is really not a good time to be adding to, adding to positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2856)|
| 0:47:45| no matter how justified and beneficial they may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2865)|
| 0:47:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| Having said that, we'll take it to a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| I believe we probably need to do roll call again, starting with District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2877)|
| 0:48:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2884)|
| 0:48:11| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| And I'm voting, I'm voting on what's on the agenda, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| That's the motion before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| Just to be clear, you're voting to approve the addition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2903)|

| 0:48:51| Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| That is five no votes and four yes votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| That concludes our regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| Public forum, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2943)|

| 0:49:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| Mr. Norman, I'm suffering from you looking at different numbers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2959)|
| 0:49:23| And we do have a speaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| We do, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| I'd like to call on Caitlin Nowell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2965)|
| 0:49:33| Please state your name and county residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2973)|
| 0:49:39| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| My name is Caitlin Nowell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| I am a resident in District 2 and I teach in District 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| I am a seventh grade English language arts teacher at South Dole Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| First, I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak with you all tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| And I also want to thank you for the important work that you do to change the lives of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| And I'm here tonight to talk about change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| To illustrate my point, I would love to tell you a story about Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| Tony was in my class last year and he was a struggling student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| He has an individual education plan, otherwise known as an IEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| He struggled with a reading deficit and a writing deficit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| and historically experienced a very low level of success in school in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| and really just felt like a failure and communicated that to me often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| And it hurt my heart for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| Over the course of last year, through a lot of hard work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| he grew from the third percentile from his previous TN Ready test to the 18th percentile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3038)|
| 0:50:46| which is not fully where he needs to be in order to be on track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| but that is tremendous growth and we celebrated wholeheartedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3050)|
| 0:50:56| And what was the catalyst for this change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| It was high expectations in the form of rigorous standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| and an aligned assessment that accurately measured that growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3064)|
| 0:51:09| Tony and dozens more of my personal students are prime reasons why I ask you tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3069)|
| 0:51:15| that you stay the course with the TN Ready assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| After years of trial and error, field tests, multiple sets of standards in each subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3080)|
| 0:51:27| changing the test at this juncture would be a massive disruption to teachers and students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3087)|
| 0:51:33| Our Tennessee standards were curated specifically with Tennessee students in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| They were created by Tennessee teachers for Tennessee students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3098)|
| 0:51:44| The TN Ready was then crafted again with heavy input from educators across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| to cater specifically to our Tennessee state standards that we teach every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| The TN Ready provides the stability and the alignment that the ACT Aspire Suite does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3116)|
| 0:52:03| Because the ACT Aspire Suite is not fully aligned to our Tennessee standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3123)|
| 0:52:09| we run the risk of teachers throwing out the rigorous academic standards that they teach every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3129)|
| 0:52:15| and returning to those old methods of teaching to the test and drill and kill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3135)|
| 0:52:21| The TN Ready has provided me as an educator with invaluable student-specific data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| that allows me to identify the individual needs in my students' learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| Because it is directly aligned, the student reports go into great detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| If you've ever had a chance to look at them, they tell by standard how the student performed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3156)|
| 0:52:43| they tell by category, they have comparisons, how the student did compared to his school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3163)|
| 0:52:50| to his district, to the state, they have strengths and weaknesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| and then what can the teacher or the parents do to help that student improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3175)|
| 0:53:00| As a state and as a county, we have worked so hard to become the fastest-improving state in the nation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3180)|
| 0:53:07| and I am so proud to say that I work in the fastest-improving state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| Our standards and our assessment are critical steps that we took in order to lead us to this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3191)|
| 0:53:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| Thank you, Madam Chair. That concludes public forum on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3203)|
| 0:53:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| Okay, I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3215)|
| 0:53:39| One would be, on the teacher performance evaluation, the fact that, I guess my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3219)|
| 0:53:50| does Tiger, is Tiger still too limited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| Does Tiger address this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| If we were to move all our schools to Tiger, would this still be an issue for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3237)|
| 0:54:06| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| Well, as we've heard, there's been much success with the Tiger model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| I've heard a lot less, I guess, from the standpoint of people objecting to, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3254)|
| 0:54:21| people don't object to evaluation, they object to the method of evaluation, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| And Tiger, in my mind, addresses this because it's a year-long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| It's not a score after one observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| So it does take into effect the whole year-long teaching process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3273)|
| 0:54:39| So, again, board members may feel differently about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| But I think we've experienced great satisfaction from our teachers and our administrators with the Tiger model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3283)|
| 0:54:49| So I don't, I see that addressing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| But, again, board members may have different opinions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| Okay, thank you, Superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| I definitely am in favor of us moving everybody to Tiger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| And, of course, that's a different topic for a different day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| But it seems like that may be, that was my thought, that that may be addressed with Tiger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3308)|
| 0:55:16| I like, of course, we have two different versions of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| The one that has the bullet points for the funding issue, I like that portion of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3321)|
| 0:55:26| that kind of puts all of those funding requests together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3326)|
| 0:55:33| So kind of maybe to try to marry these two documents, that may be something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3333)|
| 0:55:39| I like the bullet points of the first one, and I like the funding part of the second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| So that would be my opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| One other, and regarding the ACT, this was definitely something that we heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3347)|
| 0:55:53| And I know Ms. Owen will have some information to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| This is definitely something that we heard at TSBA that other districts were in favor of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3355)|
| 0:56:03| I guess I am not comfortable that I know enough about it to really go there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3363)|
| 0:56:10| And like I said last week, I really think that it may be better if we focus our priorities when we approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3370)|
| 0:56:19| so that we are truly focusing on the biggest issues that we have, the largest issues that we have in the funding and vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3379)|
| 0:56:29| So I would like to see us be a little more targeted in that way and do a little more research on the ACT issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3389)|
| 0:56:37| I don't think our legislature is going to do anything with that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| So I think that we probably need to do a little more research on that for my comfort level before we include that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3401)|
| 0:56:49| So I would love to hear from other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3412)|
| 0:56:53| Just for a point of clarification here before we go further, you have two drafts in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3413)|
| 0:57:00| One of them in the red has draft at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3420)|
| 0:57:06| The second copy says it does not, Knox County Board of Education Legislative Priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3426)|
| 0:57:16| It's stapled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| It's stapled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| So for a point of clarification, Ms. Horne, when you were talking about bullet points, you were ‑‑ please clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3441)|
| 0:57:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| May I suggest, may I just suggest, if there's no objection, that we look at the draft, the red one, and let's assume this is our base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3460)|
| 0:57:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3476)|
| 0:57:57| Is that ‑‑ is everyone in agreement with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| I don't know if I need to make that in the form of a motion or not, but I see a lot of heads nodding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| So for the purposes of discussion, the one with the red draft will be the document that we will start discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3488)|
| 0:58:15| and adding to or taking from using this other draft that Ms. Owen suggested for consideration to combine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3495)|
| 0:58:27| Are we all clear on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| Do I need to restate what I said, or does what I say make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3513)|
| 0:58:34| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3514)|
| 0:58:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3516)|
| 0:58:37| Two things to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| First, the ACT suite of assessments, this is the language directly from TSBA that we also approved there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3518)|
| 0:58:46| And this does not require that we use the ACT suite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| This only calls on the Department of Education to allow districts to use the ACT suite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3531)|
| 0:59:00| So it's there so that it could be available, so that we could make that choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3540)|
| 0:59:06| But they would have to agree first before we could even decide whether to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3546)|
| 0:59:14| Under teacher performance evaluation, this is also, I believe, language from TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3554)|
| 0:59:21| It is very similar to what, well, it's almost exactly what we had previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| with the exception that team is specifically removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| and just as summative scores should only be used in an advisory capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3571)|
| 0:59:40| I think it's important for us to continue looking at the evaluation overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3580)|
| 0:59:46| because there are pieces that some teachers have that other teachers do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| So using multiple measures, I think we want to continue to talk with our legislature about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3591)|
| 0:59:57| and also making sure that we have input from actual educators in Tennessee that we can identify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3597)|
| 1:00:07| not just that they say we had input, but that we know that we actually did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| The funding for teacher salaries, I believe that is also the same as it was in our other version last year previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3613)|
| 1:00:28| I would like to move that up under funding so that could be together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3628)|
| 1:00:35| I think that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3635)|
| 1:00:40| All right. Ms. Fab?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| I would like to speak to the ACT suite assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| I'm a little like Ms. Horne. I don't feel like I personally know enough about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| but what troubles me is there was a move to go to a national test, PARCC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3651)|
| 1:00:57| and that caused all sorts of controversy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| And so we in Common Core and PARCC and what we as a state decided was we needed our own standards developed here in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3660)|
| 1:01:09| and then a test was developed to align to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| And I think from what I have been told, there's been a lot of teacher input about that test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3673)|
| 1:01:21| And so it concerns me that we are, even though we're not saying we necessarily want that test here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3681)|
| 1:01:29| we're now trying to get a national test to be our, at least an option that is not necessarily aligned to our standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3689)|
| 1:01:40| And I think the ACT test that all of our juniors and seniors take, it's a very different measurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3700)|
| 1:01:48| And I think that's sometimes where I think, and maybe I don't have enough knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| but the ACT that I know that they take for college entry is trying to test a very different type of learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| than what is learned on a yearly basis by students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| It's a culmination of a lifetime of learning when they take the ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| And so I think when we talk about so much emphasis on ACT and so, therefore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| why don't we go to the ACT suite of assessments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| it seems like it's kind of going against what came up a few years ago about wanting a Tennessee standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3733)|
| 1:02:21| and test aligned to those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| Any other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| In an effort to try to come to a document we can all accept, I've heard three things mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3754)|
| 1:02:46| And again, I'm looking at the draft, the red draft copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3766)|
| 1:02:52| I heard the first comments on teacher performance evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3772)|
| 1:03:00| It is in the red draft in the form of a bullet point and a sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3780)|
| 1:03:12| It is also in the other document, which is a little more lengthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3792)|
| 1:03:23| Actually, it's about, which is a more lengthy statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3803)|
| 1:03:31| In essence, as Ms. Owen said, it's straight out of TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3811)|
| 1:03:37| I'm not sure that one maybe is any better than the other except that the draft one is just briefer and more concise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3817)|
| 1:03:51| May I have a, is there a motion that the Owen draft, for lack of a better descriptor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3831)|
| 1:04:04| be used in lieu of the current sentence on the red draft?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3844)|
| 1:04:13| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| I think looking at this, I'm more in favor whether we leave the ACT suite of assessments in or remove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3854)|
| 1:04:23| I really like the format of the Owen draft better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| And I think the final sentence, I don't see it in the red draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3867)|
| 1:04:32| The affirmative score should only be used in an advisory capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| and not as a major determinant factor in forming personnel decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| I think that's a very key point that TSBA has included under their teacher performance evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3882)|
| 1:04:51| And if I'm looking at it correctly, that is not included in the red draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3891)|
| 1:04:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| So I think there are some specifics in the Owen draft that would be valuable to keep in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3899)|
| 1:05:09| And really it's still just a one-page document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| We may have smaller font, but it's still one page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| And I really like the funding portion a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| It's a lot more readable and user-friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| And I think it highlights the areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| The red draft is very hard for me to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| And on Owens, you've got exactly what funding we're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| So that would be my thoughts on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| But the main thing was that the summative score should only be used in an advisory capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3938)|
| 1:05:44| and not as a major determinant in personnel decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3944)|
| 1:05:50| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| That is really a valid point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| All right then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| Initially I had suggested talking about the red draft as our working document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3957)|
| 1:06:03| I'm hearing Ms. Bounds suggesting we use the Owen draft as the working document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3963)|
| 1:06:11| So what is the board's pleasure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| We just need to land on one or the other here and then look at revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3973)|
| 1:06:19| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3981)|
| 1:06:22| I think it basically, for the most part, is the same except the formatting on the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3982)|
| 1:06:30| So I'm fine with using Ms. Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| I think that we need to just talk about the last item then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| So, Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| Well, is Representative Cain still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| Maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| He just left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| That's sad because in sitting through some of the educational committees at the state that they held,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4010)|
| 1:06:59| there is a lot of support among our state legislators for the ACT suite of assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4019)|
| 1:07:06| I mean, I don't know how much that impacts what we do as a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4026)|
| 1:07:13| I'm like you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| I could know more, but I don't think this limits us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| And there is support down there in Nashville to move to an ACT test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| So because of all the problems we've had with testing in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| and originally we borrowed some of those standards, if you all that were not on the board remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4047)|
| 1:07:34| Ms. Owen could probably speak to that better than I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4054)|
| 1:07:38| but we actually bought some of those standards and testing from other states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4058)|
| 1:07:43| and to say they were Tennessee developed was not an accurate statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| Now, we have had a lot of teacher input since then, but let no one kid themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| These were things that were purchased for the use of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4073)|
| 1:08:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| Again, before we go any further, board, no, board, please tell me, please tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4082)|
| 1:08:12| Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4092)|
| 1:08:13| Are we going to use the Owen draft and work from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| or do you prefer to use the red draft and work from that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4097)|
| 1:08:21| Do I need to make this in the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| Can I move to use the Owen draft as our formulation to move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4108)|
| 1:08:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4109)|
| 1:08:30| Motion by Babb, second by Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4110)|
| 1:08:36| Now, do we have any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| I see lights, but no discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4124)|
| 1:08:45| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| Everyone put the Owen draft on the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4129)|
| 1:08:50| Now, in an effort still to try to be concise on this, instead of jumping from one to another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4130)|
| 1:08:59| I have heard discussion on the teacher performance bullet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4139)|
| 1:09:07| and Ms. Bounds rightly pointed out that the longer statement includes the accountability piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4147)|
| 1:09:17| So unless there is specific objection about that, we will move forward keeping that as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4157)|
| 1:09:28| I see lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| Has anybody got a comment on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| Ms. Christy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| Okay, I see your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4175)|
| 1:09:36| So we're good on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4178)|
| 1:09:39| The next point I heard brought up was on the, let's see, the teacher salary funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4179)|
| 1:09:51| and I believe I heard again that the Owen draft, having the funding for teacher salary where it is placed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4191)|
| 1:10:02| I'm believing sounded like a better placement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| I'm seeing nods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| All righty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| The third thing that I heard brought up, which seems to be, I think, where we are now, is the ACT part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4209)|
| 1:10:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| So we are in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| I am hearing all the way down to the last bullet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4219)|
| 1:10:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| That's huge progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| So we will talk about the ACT bullet, and Ms. Babb, I believe, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4226)|
| 1:10:36| I believe it would be Christy, Babb, and Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4242)|
| 1:10:43| I just, I don't know enough about the ACT suite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| I mean, if you do a quick Google search, you'll see that a couple of states use it, and it has not went well at all for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4246)|
| 1:10:53| And I feel like including that language in here is almost like we as a board are endorsing that in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4253)|
| 1:11:00| So I don't know enough about it to actually say the ACT suite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4260)|
| 1:11:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| Yeah, I was actually going to call on Mr. Thomas or someone with your staff to maybe speak to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| since I think a lot of us feel very kind of troubled about not knowing enough about the ACT suite,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4278)|
| 1:11:23| and going to see if I could get your opinion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| Dr. Roswick, if you would address that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| Thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4291)|
| 1:11:32| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4292)|
| 1:11:33| I think there's been some good questions and good thoughts raised today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4293)|
| 1:11:40| I think as a staff, when we look at that thing, there would be, in order to make that switch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4300)|
| 1:11:45| there would be some questions that we would have too, and we're not in control of answering those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4305)|
| 1:11:50| I think a good point was made about the current purpose of both of those tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4310)|
| 1:11:54| ACT is more of, and has been in the business and built a reputation on being a college entrance exam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4314)|
| 1:12:00| and kind of an assessment of the overall culminating, what do students learn throughout their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4320)|
| 1:12:07| ACT and REDI, as we've talked before, is really more kind of a year-to-year basis of what you get from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| There could be some concerns, especially for at-risk students, when you get into like the high school suite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| If you, you know, from Algebra 1 to Geometry to Algebra 2, I haven't seen specific tests for those in the ACT suite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4336)|
| 1:12:24| So you might instead get a math grade where there is some value in knowing where a student is deficient on an annual basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4344)|
| 1:12:30| especially in at-risk populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| We've talked about alignment to the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| And here's an example of some of those places where there's some differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| The ACT is crosswalked to the Tennessee state standards, but there are some places, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| writing is not addressed in the ACT standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| So if that was kind of where we went to adopt those, you always want your standards to align to your assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4366)|
| 1:12:51| Or even science labs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| Like they're not required to meet ACT standards, which they're written into Tennessee state standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4373)|
| 1:12:58| which, you know, again, questions that we would just have how we would go about doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4378)|
| 1:13:03| I think I made another note here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| So I think there's still some questions about capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| You know, not that we want to remember that, but I think we had that happen with Bearden High School not too long ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4390)|
| 1:13:16| with ACT's ability to pull that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| Even with our pilot with Aspire, it was delayed a year for some technical problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4398)|
| 1:13:23| that we couldn't get worked out with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| So I'm not at all saying ACT is not highly qualified to carry out testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| I'm just saying vendors are vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| And so I would just, you know, want some assurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| or want us to know something to consider, too, that they have the ability to pull that off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4414)|
| 1:13:39| because we've even had some issues with that on a national test at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| And then I think we have been approached, several of our principals have, by SAT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| which currently SAT and ACT are both tests that can be taken for to meet the graduation requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4427)|
| 1:13:54| And SAT is something that's aligned to if you take the pre-SAT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4434)|
| 1:13:58| which is one of the earlier tests that gives a, what's the word I'm looking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| AP potential for how they might do in AP courses and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4442)|
| 1:14:06| So we had a few of our high schools come and talk to us about even thinking about going to the SAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| So, again, I think both companies are great companies when it comes to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| And we have had issues with TN Ready, and I think that's made some of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| but I think they do some different things in their current form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| It's not to say ACT wouldn't improve their suite or work on that, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| to date we haven't seen that product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4465)|
| 1:14:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| Ms. Hatterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| To Board Member Bowne's comments that she made regarding the standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| I had the privilege of using the crosswalk of the standards and with the ACT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4481)|
| 1:14:47| and there's not that big of a difference between the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| And so I don't know if that would be a huge issue within our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| But I'm in support of keeping it here, mostly because when you think about the ACT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4496)|
| 1:15:03| now I know it's a big picture and how it's going to, if it is adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4503)|
| 1:15:07| how it will transpire into our school setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| But it's actually a, it's a test that kids care about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| And so you actually have the motivation of kids to actually apply themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4513)|
| 1:15:18| and do what is necessary because it aligns to their future of college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| I do think that it needs to be a narrative to change that if it is adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| from the Board of Education, from the Tennessee Department of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| So I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| But I also think it's important for us to keep it on the draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| simply because it's just stating that it allows districts to choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| Now, how we know government works and how slow things can be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4541)|
| 1:15:47| it might be in our best interest to open the door now, like push forward now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| because if we continue to see the results that we see with TM Ready,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| if it continues to grow or improve or doesn't improve three or four years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4555)|
| 1:16:00| it's already on the Tennessee Department of Education that allows us to adopt ACT if we choose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4560)|
| 1:16:06| So I think it's just us being proactive versus reactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4566)|
| 1:16:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4572)|
| 1:16:15| Ms. Vaughn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| I guess it says EOC testing, so that implies high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| Is that so, is there, is it, would it just be high school we're essentially talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4581)|
| 1:16:28| TM Ready would be for K, or for third through eighth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| Ms. Owen, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4594)|
| 1:16:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| Because that's, do you know, Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| No, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| Because that's what, you know, I guess in my mind I'm thinking about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| you would have TM Ready through eighth grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| and then you would have ACT as an option, ACT Suite as an option for high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4607)|
| 1:16:53| So do you have any insight on that, Dr. Reiswick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| Thank you, Ms. Vaughn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4617)|
| 1:16:58| I know under ESSA, the Every Student Succeeds Act, the requirement even with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| because this is something that's allowable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| and I think three states in the United States have chosen to do that, North Dakota, Arizona,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4626)|
| 1:17:11| and Oklahoma are the three states that currently use the ACT at their high school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4631)|
| 1:17:16| States like Utah use the ACT, but then also have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| they actually have Questar for their 3-8 testing, so there's still a component for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| ESSA requires math and English to be assessed every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4643)|
| 1:17:29| So, again, I know ACT has worked on some new suites of some things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| and I don't know what products are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| but I know the state would have to submit, in essence, on those 3-8 grades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4655)|
| 1:17:40| to get some version of understanding that they could use that suite,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4660)|
| 1:17:45| because I haven't seen the product yet, 3-8, and that, I mean, I may be ignorant to it, that does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4665)|
| 1:17:50| But I do know ESSA does require math and ELA or reading to be tested every year in those grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4670)|
| 1:17:58| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4681)|
| 1:18:02| Yes, and I also just want to also add, when it comes to the ELC testing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4682)|
| 1:18:06| so the ACT is already happening in our classrooms for the juniors and the seniors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4686)|
| 1:18:11| and it's provided from the state as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| and so when we think about efficiency in the classroom and in the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| to make sure that we're getting the most academic instruction happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| this test has already happened, so how can we streamline our testing process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4700)|
| 1:18:24| Because when it comes to the ELC, there's chunks of time throughout the school year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4704)|
| 1:18:29| where students are taking this test because of the test, on top of also taking the ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| So to me, it just means that this is an opportunity for us to streamline and make it efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| and making sure that educators do have the opportunity to teach as much as they can in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4718)|
| 1:18:42| and not taking out those chunks of classroom instruction time to do the ELC testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4722)|
| 1:18:53| Any other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| Dr. Rasbuck, if I may, I heard you say that some of our schools are actually considering the SAT instead of the ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4737)|
| 1:19:09| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4752)|
| 1:19:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4753)|
| 1:19:14| That is a little bit troubling to me, to put a specific ACT in a legislative priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4754)|
| 1:19:25| if, in fact, other schools might want to use the SAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| I'm just stating this is pretty specific in that wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4769)|
| 1:19:38| And in lieu of EOCs, in Knox County, tell me what we give EOCs for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4778)|
| 1:19:54| I mean, what subjects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4794)|
| 1:19:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4798)|
| 1:19:59| I would probably list them off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4799)|
| 1:20:00| I'd probably leave one off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4800)|
| 1:20:01| But basically, it's the core academic in the high schools, the core academic courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4801)|
| 1:20:06| The state covers most of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| They have retracted back the English III in chemistry, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4808)|
| 1:20:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| English III in chemistry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4813)|
| 1:20:14| But other than that, most of the courses you would think of in the four core academic areas, they've given those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4814)|
| 1:20:20| In areas where we don't, where we have like foreign language or some of our CTE courses, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4820)|
| 1:20:25| we have created some local EOCs that we do and kind of scan internally and send those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4825)|
| 1:20:30| And then in courses that we have that have few students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| So everyone is giving one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4833)|
| 1:20:34| The teacher may generate their own for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| Did I hear you say, though, that as of now, though, that the ACT suite would not address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4837)|
| 1:20:48| I mean, it would satisfy ESSA, but it would not address what we, in fact, do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4848)|
| 1:20:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| And, again, I'm not a total expert on the ACT suite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| I know last time we met with their person, they were under development of some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4859)|
| 1:21:03| and even talking about into the elementary grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| But, you know, we had not seen that product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4865)|
| 1:21:08| And so, again, they could have been working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| What I think you potentially could lose with that in the states, the three states that have chosen to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4871)|
| 1:21:17| you know, they get an overall grade, I mean, overall score, their junior year on, like, an ACT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4877)|
| 1:21:22| which tells them their college preparedness in those subject areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4882)|
| 1:21:26| What you would lose, again, and my concern would be like for at-risk students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4886)|
| 1:21:31| when you go through year to year, you're not necessarily going to get how they performed in Algebra I versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4891)|
| 1:21:37| Geometry versus Algebra II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| You're going to get an overall math score their junior year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| You know, again, could we do something locally to be able to look at those things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| Those things, yes, but as far as having a comparison across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| and seeing how our district is doing versus other districts and those kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| then you would not have that in the ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| We would lose a growth measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| And, again, Mr. Dupler is the attorney, but I think the way some of the current legislation is written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4919)|
| 1:22:06| there would have to be some changes in the law as far as to your point about measurements and those kinds of things, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4926)|
| 1:22:12| So, you know, again, just trying to look at where we are in our current reality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| and we just have questions about things that we would need to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| and obviously the state would have to address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| I do hear you, and I certainly respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4940)|
| 1:22:24| And I have heard from several teachers that kind of echo what our speaker tonight said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4944)|
| 1:22:33| that for all the growing pains we've had with TenReady, and whether that's where we end up or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4953)|
| 1:22:40| is really not relevant to this particular document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4960)|
| 1:22:46| the fact that it would require some realignment with our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4966)|
| 1:22:55| who have already been through a lot of change with standards and alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4975)|
| 1:23:02| And I would be very reluctant to open that door just yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4982)|
| 1:23:09| given my personal lack of information, I guess, on really what ACT or SAT or anyone else could offer at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=4989)|
| 1:23:22| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| Well, I agree with Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| I think we may be overthinking this, and I would just like to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5007)|
| 1:23:32| is it possible for me to just make a substitute motion and that we just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5012)|
| 1:23:37| that we keep the Owen draft and remove the ACT portion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5017)|
| 1:23:42| I mean, there's going to be another year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| This is just a guideline for our legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5024)|
| 1:23:48| I feel like we're just way overthinking this at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5028)|
| 1:23:52| and there's opportunities in the future to go back and put that in or take it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5032)|
| 1:23:57| but I think it's more imperative that we get it to the state on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5037)|
| 1:24:02| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5042)|
| 1:24:03| So I don't know whether, Mr. Dupre, I'm not real good at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| if that's a substitute motion that we drop the Owen draft and remove the last portion of ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5046)|
| 1:24:16| If I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5057)|
| 1:24:18| Thank you, Madam Chair and Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| At this time, it would be a new motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| because you've already had a motion just to approve this draft as your working form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5064)|
| 1:24:30| So that would be a new motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| So I'd like to make a motion that we adopt the Owen draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| and send it to the state minus the use of ACT suite of assessments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5076)|
| 1:24:41| so we can all come to some kind of agreement tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| Thank you, Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| Second by Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| Any further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| I was just going to say that I believe I can take that out of the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| and make the font larger so that it will be a little easier to read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| and it will still all fit on one page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5108)|
| 1:25:09| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5109)|
| 1:25:12| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5114)|
| 1:25:15| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| McMillan opposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| Board members, this will be cleaned up in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5125)|
| 1:25:31| and will be immediately distributed to our legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5131)|
| 1:25:38| who I think you might know are home right now gathering information and materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5138)|
| 1:25:43| So this is really a great time to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5143)|
| 1:25:46| all right, this is what we've got and please look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5146)|
| 1:25:50| and we'll move forward from that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5150)|
| 1:25:53| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5155)|
| 1:25:56| I was under the impression that when you said we would move this Owen thing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5156)|
| 1:26:04| and talk about it as our working thing and talk about those items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5164)|
| 1:26:09| I was under the impression that we were just moving it up to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5169)|
| 1:26:15| I guess what I'm getting at is do we not need an official vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5175)|
| 1:26:21| to approve all the things down through there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5181)|
| 1:26:26| It wasn't real clear, at least to me, that with what you said, the way you said it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5186)|
| 1:26:32| we were just moving the Owen thing up for our working copy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5192)|
| 1:26:39| and you were going to discuss these things and make some adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5199)|
| 1:26:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| I appreciate your comments, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| I believe, Ms. Coatney, if you would read Ms. Bowne's motion that was stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5207)|
| 1:26:55| Ms. Bowne's motion was to adopt the Owen draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| and send to the state monist the ACT language at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5218)|
| 1:27:04| Well, yeah, on that, but was that the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5224)|
| 1:27:09| or was that the one that she just made just a minute ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| The initial motion that was made was to use the Owen draft as our working document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5232)|
| 1:27:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| As opposed to the other draft we had in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5242)|
| 1:27:25| That was the initial motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5247)|
| 1:27:28| So this last vote was the official vote of the thing in its entirety?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5248)|
| 1:27:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5253)|
| 1:27:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5254)|
| 1:27:35| Is that correct, Mr. Dupler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5255)|
| 1:27:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5256)|
| 1:27:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5257)|
| 1:27:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5258)|
| 1:27:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5260)|
| 1:27:41| Any other comments, questions, anything anyone wants to say before we adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5261)|
| 1:27:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| We do, Madam Chair, have one person for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5272)|
| 1:27:53| I thought we covered that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| Heather Wilder, please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5276)|
| 1:28:07| My name is Heather Wilder, and I'm in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5287)|
| 1:28:10| And I want to talk to you about my son, Marcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5290)|
| 1:28:14| Marcel is an honor student in the IB program at West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5294)|
| 1:28:19| He has over a 4.0 GPA, and he made a 34 on the ACT first time out, no study and no tutoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5299)|
| 1:28:27| He's been an active leader at his school over the last four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5307)|
| 1:28:32| He's introduced some of our board members at our National Achievers Society induction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5312)|
| 1:28:40| This is a partial packet of his acceptance letters to colleges and honors colleges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5320)|
| 1:28:49| However, my son wants to currently quit school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5329)|
| 1:28:55| This is because for over a year now my son has been targeted and harassed by the principal at his school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5335)|
| 1:29:01| Ashley Jesse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| And I have gone before every person, committee, adult that I'm supposed to, and nothing has been done for my son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5343)|
| 1:29:12| In fact, it's only gotten worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5352)|
| 1:29:17| There were some issues, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5357)|
| 1:29:20| Marcel is autistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| He is high-functioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5362)|
| 1:29:25| He spent the first up to ninth grade into private schools and transferred into West halfway through his ninth grade year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5365)|
| 1:29:34| And before that, I did not have these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5374)|
| 1:29:39| When this principal took over, Marcel got his 504 during her first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5379)|
| 1:29:46| At that end of that first year, there was an issue with one teacher not following a 504.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5386)|
| 1:29:52| Nothing was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5392)|
| 1:29:53| The next year, several problems crept up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| By November of 2018, nothing was still being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5397)|
| 1:30:03| So I set an appointment and met with Superintendent Thomas and Dr. Davis about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| And I told them this time last year that if this principal was not stopped, she would get worse, and the targeting of my son would get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5408)|
| 1:30:19| I am asking for help because my son has been put out of his classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5419)|
| 1:30:26| He has been bullied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| He was removed as starter on the football team by this principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5428)|
| 1:30:33| I have gotten no help from anyone involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5433)|
| 1:30:37| No one has done anything for Marcel's benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| Currently, he has not been to school since winter break started because he was ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5440)|
| 1:30:46| Well, I received an email yesterday from the principal saying that if he didn't go back to one of his classes, to the weightlifting class that they had to pull him out of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5446)|
| 1:30:54| because the coach had created a culture of humiliation, harassment, and abuse of Marcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5454)|
| 1:31:02| that the school did nothing about because the three individuals who investigated it were the AD, Chris Carruthers, the principal, Ashley Jesse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5462)|
| 1:31:11| Ma'am, you need to stop using personal names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5474)|
| 1:31:15| The principal, the AD, and the head football coach, all were the people involved in investigating what they had done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5475)|
| 1:31:25| Now, something about that seems wrong to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| You can't have the Foxes investigating the Foxes about what's going on in the hen house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5488)|
| 1:31:34| It's just that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| So, Marcel's 504 has been violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| Currently, his fate is being violated, and no one cares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5499)|
| 1:31:44| Four months until graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| Four months, and we have nothing in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5507)|
| 1:31:51| Four months, and I don't know how my child is going to get to me because of this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5511)|
| 1:32:00| I don't know who I'm supposed to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5520)|
| 1:32:03| I don't know what I'm supposed to do next Tuesday when he goes back to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5523)|
| 1:32:08| And I am asking this board, because apparently the superintendent's office has no authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5528)|
| 1:32:14| apparently no one over the principal has any authority or will do anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5534)|
| 1:32:20| I'm asking for an official investigation and for you all to meet with my son over these matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5540)|
| 1:32:26| because, as I've already been told by attorneys who I've spoken to, he has a lawsuit against Knox County for what has been done to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5546)|
| 1:32:35| I'm just trying to get him graduated into one of these colleges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5555)|
| 1:32:39| That is my goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5559)|
| 1:32:40| That has been my goal since the child was diagnosed when he was two and a half years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5560)|
| 1:32:47| And I don't know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| So you are my last resort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5569)|
| 1:32:53| And I'm asking for your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5573)|
| 1:32:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5579)|
| 1:33:04| Okay, we don't respond during public forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5587)|
| 1:33:08| But I appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5588)|
| 1:33:09| Madam Chair, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5589)|
| 1:33:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5590)|
| 1:33:11| And just for clarification, Mr. Dupler, if you wouldn't mind addressing the board as far as our position when lawsuits have been filed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5591)|
| 1:33:21| when there's legal action pending, what your instruction to the board is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5601)|
| 1:33:27| Well, I didn't hear whether or not a lawsuit had been filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| I guess I'd heard that a lawsuit had been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| But, I mean, if a lawsuit has been filed, then that's not something that the board would discuss publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5615)|
| 1:33:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5623)|
| 1:33:44| I have not filed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5624)|
| 1:33:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5625)|
| 1:33:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5626)|
| 1:33:47| I have a year after he graduates to file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5627)|
| 1:33:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5628)|
| 1:33:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5629)|
| 1:33:50| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5636)|
| 1:33:57| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5637)|
| 1:33:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5638)|
| 1:33:59| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5639)|
| 1:34:00| All in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5640)|
| 1:34:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5641)|
| 1:34:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5642)|
| 1:34:03| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190116?start=5643)|
