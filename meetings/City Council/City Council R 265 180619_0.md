| 0:02:00| begin. Is there a motion to approve the minutes? So moved. Second. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=120)|
| 0:02:07| All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The minutes are approved. Are there items to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=127)|
| 0:02:14| be withdrawn? Vice Mayor Saunders. Oh yes and I failed to get that but it is item 11P I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=134)|
| 0:02:22| believe. 11P that's correct. My apologies. I left my notes at home. That would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=142)|
| 0:02:30| withdrawn. I think it will reappear in a different form. All right this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=150)|
| 0:02:35| request authorizing the mayor to execute documents related to a grant from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| Homeland Security. So there's a motion and a second to withdraw that. Okay. Any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=160)|
| 0:02:47| other discussion? All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? That is withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=167)|
| 0:02:52| Anything else to be withdrawn? Items to be postponed? Items to be added by motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=172)|
| 0:02:59| Councilman Roberto. Thank you Mayor. I'm going to make a motion to add a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=179)|
| 0:03:04| resolution approving the issuance of a certificate of compliance to Butler and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=184)|
| 0:03:09| Bailey market relative to a wine and grocery store renewal on today's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=189)|
| 0:03:14| Butler and Bailey has been serving customers in Rocky Hill for almost 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=194)|
| 0:03:17| years. They've been serving wine since July of 2016 when it first became legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=197)|
| 0:03:23| Their renewal application was mailed in and unfortunately was just one day late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=203)|
| 0:03:29| in being able to make it on today's agenda. That is quite unfortunate because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=209)|
| 0:03:33| on June 30th they will no longer have that license. So to make this easier for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=213)|
| 0:03:40| customers and to make sure there's no interruption in service, I move to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=220)|
| 0:03:44| this to a resolution, this resolution to our agenda this evening which will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| require a unanimous vote by all council to put it on the agenda. Second. Okay and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| if this gets added then we'll put it under the consent items which follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| Okay. Thank you. All right so we have a motion and a second to add this what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| will be 11 U a certificate of compliance. Any questions? All in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Okay that has been added unanimously. So now we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| anything else to be added by motion? So we are now on the consent items which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| are 11 R through U now. Certificates of compliance and 12 B through I 202s. Move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=257)|
| 0:04:25| for approval. Any discussion? Well I guess there will be no discussion. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=265)|
| 0:04:31| consent item. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Those are approved. Okay for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| the mayor's report. I'd like to start by asking our fire chief Stan Sharp to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=276)|
| 0:04:42| bring us up to date on some of the serious fires we've had over the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| several days. We had three firefighters hospitalized for dehydration and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| exhaustion and like to ask the chief to give us an update on them and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| department. Yes we've actually had four serious fires over starting Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=294)|
| 0:04:59| evening. We had two. One was at a commercial supply house that actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=299)|
| 0:05:10| provides aquarium supplies and builds aquarium supplies. Two of our firefighters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=310)|
| 0:05:16| went down with dehydration and exhaustion on the scene there. Both of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=316)|
| 0:05:23| them were transported to UT Hospital and were later released. So they just got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=323)|
| 0:05:29| dehydrated and and it was a very long and difficult fire to fight. So they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=329)|
| 0:05:36| in their turnout gear and in the heat it was it came in late in the evening but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| it was still in the 90s and this was a block building that which held the heat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| in too and so the the conditions were just were extreme and so two of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=345)|
| 0:05:53| went down there. They're fine now. We had another one go down with dehydration on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| Sunday evening. He also was transported to the hospital and and just had to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| rehydrated and assessed. All three of them are doing fine and have returned to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| full duty though. So we take extra precautions during the summer hours just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| because of the extreme heat that that occurs and then once you go into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=373)|
| 0:06:19| fire obviously gets even more extreme conditions. So we encourage our people to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=379)|
| 0:06:24| hydrate all day long the day before but even if they do that sometimes you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=384)|
| 0:06:31| the conditions can just be so bad that you just get complete heat exhaustion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=391)|
| 0:06:37| But fortunately we have mechanisms in place to assess them on the scene and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=397)|
| 0:06:44| see if they need to to seek further care. Thank you for sharing that with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=404)|
| 0:06:50| Please I'm sure all of council will share in these words to let them know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| that we're thinking of them. We're glad they're okay and it's just a reminder to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=414)|
| 0:06:58| all of us of the the dangers that our emergency responders face every single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| day. Thank you. Now I'd like to ask our finance director Jim York to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| forward and give us a short report on a bond issue that council approved at our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| last meeting. Jim? Jim York, finance director. Just give you a brief update on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=432)|
| 0:07:21| the bond sale that actually occurred today. Today the city issued fourteen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| point six two five million dollars in new debt. This is for streetlights and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| other various projects. The interest rate on the bonds we actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=452)|
| 0:07:41| had eleven bids which is pretty significant. That's a pretty good number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| of bids. The winning bid was just a hair under two point three six percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=466)|
| 0:07:54| Actually after we resized it it actually lowered a little bit to now it's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| under two point three five percent is our interest rate. Premiums on the bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=478)|
| 0:08:05| were a little over one point oh four million. So the total cash received from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=485)|
| 0:08:12| by the city is around fifteen point six million total. I would need to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=492)|
| 0:08:23| that the issuance call underwriters discount was around fifty five thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| dollars and issuance costs were just under a hundred and eleven thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| That's what they're estimated to be. So again what we'll end up with in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| project total is about fifteen point five million dollars for for these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| projects. Bonds are for a ten-year period. We have a call provision after eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| years. The interest rates on the coupons actually range from two and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=527)|
| 0:08:54| percent to five percent but the true interest cost is again under two point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| four million or two point four percent. Annual payment is roughly one point seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=538)|
| 0:09:05| six five million dollars per year. So I'll be happy to answer any questions if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| you have them. Does anyone have any questions? All right thank you Jim. I also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=550)|
| 0:09:17| want to tell council that as y'all heard yesterday Chief Roush has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=557)|
| 0:09:23| appointed to the position of TBI director by the governor. Of course it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| bittersweet for all of us. We hate to see him leave our community. At the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| it's a great opportunity for him and I think for the state to have him in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| role. He is actually on his way. He had to meet with the governor and TBI staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=575)|
| 0:09:40| today is on his way back and if he makes it in time then we'll have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| opportunity to recognize him and for him to speak to us as well. But we'll go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| ahead and move on. I've got some more items to make sure people know about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| before we move on to the agenda. So we have a very busy weekend coming up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| a few major events that I need to remind everybody about. First of all Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| and Oak Ridge in just a few days will be the center of the competitive cycling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| universe. How do you like that? Cycling universe. It's quite a feather in the cap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=608)|
| 0:10:14| for Knoxville and Visit Knoxville. This is the second consecutive year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| that the Knoxville area has hosted the U.S. Pro Road and Individual Time Trial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=618)|
| 0:10:24| Championships and the first year is host of the U.S. Pro Criterium. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=624)|
| 0:10:31| Wright you probably understand this better than anybody being a competitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| cyclist. These world-class races will require closure of a number of streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| in downtown Knoxville on Friday evening June 22nd this Friday and roads in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| downtown East Knoxville and South Knoxville all day on Sunday June 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| It's a great series of racing events but you'll want to go to Visit Knoxville's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=650)|

| 0:14:15| all. I also wanted to mention that many of us may not know here in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=855)|

| 0:15:07| bowling tournament in which the city was able to prevail and we hope to make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| two in a row. Well it's a good thing that it's a mini-golf tournament not an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=911)|
| 0:15:19| actual golf tournament that might be that might make a difference but anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=919)|

| 0:15:28| good cause and we'll have fun with this a little bit of competition but just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| wanted to let everyone know we were doing that. Very good, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=932)|

| 0:15:55| I'd also like to just recognize that today is known as Juneteenth which is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=955)|
| 0:16:07| nationally recognized celebration. It's one of the oldest known celebrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| that commemorates the ending of slavery in the United States and so the Beck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=971)|

| 0:16:23| dressed in costume for different events that have happened through the course of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| the time celebrating this occasion. There's also a town hall meeting at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| 630 so I will have to silently excuse myself here shortly that will be held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| and we will have several elected officials from this district that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| be participating so just wanted to recognize that as well. Thank you. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| you. Councilwoman Singh Perez. Hi, I'd like to make a statement tonight taking a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| serious turn regarding the separation of children from their undocumented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| families. There are Americans today who have been told that their job requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| them to separate children from their parents. They work a full day following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| their orders then go home to their families, go to bed, get up the next day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| and do it again. We can't know the full extent of human| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| damage being done in the name of policy, a policy that I feel is evil to its core| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1033)|
| 0:17:19| but we can and I do pledge never to ask our Knoxville law enforcement officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1039)|
| 0:17:26| or any other employees to do something that I myself would not do in good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| conscience. We citizens of Knoxville must hold ourselves to a higher standard. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| is a pledge that I make on record today. I encourage my colleagues to stand with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| me. There is a Keeping Families Together rally on Monday June 25th at 6 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1060)|
| 0:17:48| right outside here. Thank you Councilwoman and in light of that I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1068)|
| 0:17:54| share too something that we posted in light of the separation of families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| Posted this on the mayor's Facebook post on Facebook today that in light of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1079)|
| 0:18:05| separation of families and detention of children at the US-Mexico border, I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| to repost remarks that I made in 2016 at the National Immigrant Integration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| Conference in Nashville. They're following. We must be unafraid to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| what we know to be true, that the diversity of our cities, our states, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| our nation is a great strength not a weakness. That every new wave of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| immigrants and refugees for the past 250 years has faced intolerance and bigotry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1107)|
| 0:18:32| from those who came before. That each of those waves of immigrants, documented and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| undocumented alike, has fueled our growth, enhanced our culture, and enriched our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| communities. And that every time we have let fear of newcomers drive our politics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| and our policies, we have made terrible mistakes that have betrayed the spirit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1127)|
| 0:18:52| and the promise of our founding. And so that's posted along with further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| remarks. But I have to say too that it is a federal issue but it impacts all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1137)|
| 0:19:03| and there are mayors across the country and councils and others that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| speaking out about this. I know there are a group of mayors that are heading down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| Texas on Wednesday, I think Wednesday, which I can't, I've got other stuff, I've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1150)|
| 0:19:17| stuff, the police chief I need to appoint, so I'm not going to make it down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| But there's a lot of action happening across the country. A lot of people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| concerned. Churches, of course, are speaking out, civic groups, individuals. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| thank you for sharing that. Okay, any other reports from council? We will move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1169)|

| 0:22:09| Knoxville and Asheville trade a lot of street performers between cities. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| a lot of folks coming down from here and a lot of folks coming up from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| It's against the First Amendment to pick and choose what instruments people can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| come and play on the street. You can't say that it's okay for somebody to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| out with a classical violin but they cannot play an electric electric violin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1347)|

| 0:23:06| putting up basic information or talking to people would be a surefire way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1386)|
| 0:23:12| start talking about making positive change as far as any taking away any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1392)|

| 0:23:24| who come out you know this is 2017 who play music. Folks are doing loop stations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1404)|
| 0:23:32| now. They're doing backing tracks. They're playing their own backing tracks. All of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| that is done through amplification. There is no separation between Bluetooth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1416)|
| 0:23:43| speakers and normal speakers. It's all the same. They're all the same volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| They can all be the same volume. It would put other people out of business that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1427)|

| 0:23:58| You know so right now you know I'm looking around and I haven't found a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| single street performance advocacy group that anyone at council has reached out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1443)|
| 0:24:09| to. Nobody's reached out to any of our national or worldwide advocacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1449)|
| 0:24:15| groups that I have found so far. I feel like jumping straight to oppressive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1455)|
| 0:24:21| regulation before even talking about making positive change is a really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| negative thing and that we're skipping a few steps here despite the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| it's just wrong to tell people to stomp all over the First Amendment like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| There are better ways to do this. Thanks. Thank you and you and Miss Roach you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1475)|
| 0:24:43| known as the spoon lady. Yes. And I have to say I saw you at WDVX recently. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1483)|
| 0:24:49| were fabulous. I really enjoyed the concert, the show. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| Thank you. Next is Sterling Walsh. Mr. Walsh, please state your name and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1494)|
| 0:25:02| address for the record and I'll set the timer. You have up to five minutes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| thank you for being here. Thank you. Good evening. I'd like to first thank the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1506)|
| 0:25:12| council for allowing me to speak. My name is Sterling Walsh. I'm a musician, a court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| clerk, and an attorney here in Knoxville. My address is 2333 Dandridge Avenue with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| a zip code of 37915. I'm here to voice my opposition to the proposed amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1522)|
| 0:25:30| to the city's noise ordinance as written regarding amplified sound. I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| start off by saying that Knoxville is a historically musical and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| artistic town. The numerous festivals, venues, and especially street performers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| add to the character and culture of downtown Knoxville which makes the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| appealing to locals and visitors alike. As you know, the proposed amendment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| the noise ordinance declares any amplified sound to be unreasonably loud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| unusual, or unnecessary. However, the term amplified sound is not defined within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1557)|
| 0:26:04| the ordinance. There's obviously some confusion about the term because a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| recent article in the Knox News Sentinel quoted the downtown coordinator saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| that the amendment would not apply to Bluetooth speakers as they do not use an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| amplifier. The statement is false. All electromechanical speakers require some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| type of amplification. Furthermore, the proposed amendment constitutes a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1583)|
| 0:26:29| blanket ban on amplified sound on any public property at any time. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| regulation brings up several free speech concerns protected by the First| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Although the regulation will unreasonably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| restrict other types of speech, I'm here to discuss musicians. You see, there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| certain types of instruments which literally require amplification to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| heard, such as an electric guitar or keyboard. There are also instruments that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1613)|
| 0:26:59| while acoustic, require accompaniment through the use of amplification, such as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| Bob Maddox, who is present tonight, who plays the musical Saul. You may have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| him perform downtown. So to allow certain people to exercise speech in the form of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1628)|
| 0:27:14| musical expression and not others due to the mechanics of the instrument or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1634)|
| 0:27:20| need for melodic accompaniment causes this law to be arbitrary in its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| application. The constitutional framework set out by the Supreme Court regarding a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1644)|
| 0:27:30| regulation like this is clear. The law must be narrowly tailored to promote a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| substantial governmental interest that would be achieved less effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| absent the regulation, and the means chosen are not substantially broader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| than necessary to achieve that interest. That's quoting Ward v. Rock against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1665)|
| 0:27:51| racism, 491 U.S. 781. Here the governmental interest is to protect the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1671)|
| 0:27:58| citizens from unwelcome and unreasonably loud noise, and the government may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| regulate the time, place, and manner of certain speech as long as the regulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| is content neutral. So long as the means chosen are not substantially broader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| than necessary to achieve the government's interest, a regulation will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| not be invalid. The proposed amendment to the noise ordinance is overly broad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| because it prohibits amplified sound anywhere in the city at any time without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| taking into account the volume of the sound. Therefore, I propose that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| amendment be more narrowly tailored to allow amplified sound with decibel level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| and time restrictions rather than a citywide ban on amplified sound. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| ordinance could mirror the way that Chattanooga has treated this issue. Since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| I've limited time, I won't read through their noise ordinance, but they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| clearly set standards that restrict amplified sound based on volume, time of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1734)|
| 0:29:00| day, and proximity to dwellings. And I've got those citations to Chattanooga's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| code is section 25-68. I have one minute, sir, so you have one more minute. I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1746)|
| 0:29:13| wanted to warn you. I'm wrapping up and then the other the other relevant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| provision is section 25-69. Thank you. For these reasons, I respectfully request the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1756)|
| 0:29:24| council to reconsider this issue. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Okay, so now we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1764)|
| 0:29:31| David Hayes. Mr. Hayes, thank you for being here. Please state your name and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1771)|
| 0:29:38| address for the record. And as you know, you have up to five minutes. My name is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1778)|
| 0:29:46| David Hayes. I live at 1312 Hawthorne Avenue, and I want to say, Seema, thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| you for your statement. It's when you do stuff like that, it makes me really happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| that I put in so much work to get you up and elected with my fellow city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| councilman folks. I appreciate your statement. So just to get started, I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| to read an excerpt from an article that was released recently that ranked Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| 36 out of 50 worst cities in America. This is how it started. About one in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1808)|
| 0:30:15| every four Knoxville residents lives in poverty. Well, well about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| 14% share of Americans in the second highest poverty rate at any large city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1820)|
| 0:30:27| in the state, the report noted. Poor areas often struggle with crime, and in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1827)|
| 0:30:33| both violent and property crimes are more than twice as common as they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| nationwide. The city struggles with low income and high crime rates. I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1837)|
| 0:30:43| it's obvious that answering our perceived problems with police and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| criminalization is not working well for the city or our community members. Banning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| and criminalizing alternative economies and different ways for people to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| money, like busking, is not in the best interest of the working class and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| impoverished communities and transit communities in this city and that come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| through the city. This ordinance will give cops more tools to criminalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| folks, and cops will undoubtedly enforce this ordinance inequitably, as they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| with many of their policies. I doubt we'll see this ordinance being heavily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| enforced in affluent areas in West Knoxville. I and others have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1879)|
| 0:31:25| peacefully protested throughout the city, and cops have repeatedly threatened to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| arrest me and others for amplified sounds violations. Right, so this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| past few years, this has been repeatedly happening. Most recently, though, in South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| Knoxville, at the gentrification and displacement celebration the city calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| open streets. I fear this ordinance will give license to cops to arrest and cite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| people before they even give a single warning or threat. Criminalization is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1906)|
| 0:31:53| to answer to our city's perceived problems. Eliminating alternative means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| of income, alternative economies, things that bring people to our city. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1918)|
| 0:32:04| transfer between Asheville and Knoxville is pretty evident, right, as far as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| people who perform and everything, right, and people take note of that. People come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| to Knoxville for these performances. It's part of the atmosphere of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| downtown and downtown areas. Attacking that is not something a welcoming city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| would do. Thank y'all for y'all's time. Thank you. Okay, council, that is... I apologize, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1940)|
| 0:32:32| didn't know how to sign up to speak. May I say something as well? Are you speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| against it? Our council rules are up to three people to speak on either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| side, so are you here to speak against it? Am I allowed to not speak for or against but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| give a statement? I'm going to defer to council to see if they have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| objection to let this person speak. I don't have any objection. Okay, there's no objection, so go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| ahead. Ma'am, state your name and address for the record and I'll set the timer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| for you. Of course, thank you. My name is Julie Mitchell. I live at 602 South Gay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| Street. I actually didn't come here to make a statement. I have no prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| statement and my lawyer is probably going to be very upset with me. A few of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| you are going to hear from me in the near future about a noise issue that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| significantly higher than 65 decibels and I won't name the entity that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=1995)|
| 0:33:21| causing the issue, but this is a, you know, all day, all night, up to 85 decibels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| issue. A very powerful entity in town and I really want to contrast that the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2007)|
| 0:33:34| allows this entity to make noise that is in violation of EPA standards, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2014)|
| 0:33:40| violation of OSHA standards, at the same time, you know, worrying about lesser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2020)|
| 0:33:47| noise that constitutes a sort of a beautiful tapestry of art in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2027)|
| 0:33:54| community and I really would like you to consider how we treat the powerful and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2034)|
| 0:34:01| how we treat the artists and the more vulnerable, you know, kind of struggling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2041)|
| 0:34:08| artistic people in our community. So again, you'll be hearing from me, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| really would like you to put that in perspective that we need to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| community that promotes art. If you want to be the next Austin, Texas, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| need your buskers. So I'm going to speak, I'm not giving an opinion, I'm giving a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| perspective, but I would like you to take that into account and I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| genuinely appreciate your time in listening to me. Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2071)|
| 0:34:38| Okay, so council, that is the end of the speakers from the audience. So is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2078)|
| 0:34:49| discussion among council? Councilman Roberto. Mayor, it may be useful since we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| have some folks that may be joining us today that weren't here for the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| reading. We had some questions and I don't know if there's somebody here who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| can speak to Mr. Emmett. Maybe you can come to answer some of these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| Maybe a little bit of a repeat from last time, but we do have some new folks here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| visiting with us. We had a question about a blanket ban on amplification and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2114)|
| 0:35:23| could you maybe make some comment on whether or not this is a blanket ban on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| amplification? It is a blanket ban on amplification. The Bluetooth speaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2126)|
| 0:35:34| quote that the fellow mentioned a minute ago was taken out of context. That was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| not a quote, that was a conversation we have with the reporters. So just to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| that clear, it's a tricky thing. I guess all speakers are technically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| amplified, but it really gets to the volume level and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| Our officers, it's complaint driven. Chief Roush spoke to this last council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| meeting and I'm sure Chief Thomas could do the same thing. She was lieutenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| downtown for a number of years. It really comes down to the volume and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| activity. We love our buskers. I love all the buskers that are here. I've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| them as well. They're very good and we have lots of acoustic bands. We've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| very few complaints about buskers. That's a very minor part of what we're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| to get to at this ordinance change. So let me stop you there because the way I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2177)|
| 0:36:24| would define a blanket ban is a little different from my understanding of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| this resolution would actually do or this ordinance would actually do. It is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| not a blanket ban in my review of it because there's an option to get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| permit which would allow you to have amplified sound. Is that not correct? That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| is correct. You're correct. So it may just be splitting hairs there but you aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2203)|
| 0:36:50| allowed to have, with this ordinance, you wouldn't be allowed to have amplified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| sound unless you had a permit. Correct. A special event permit. On public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| property. And those are a little trickier to give. Yes, you're exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| correct. Well and one of the issues that you and I had talked about beforehand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| before the last time this came up was the availability and the flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| with regard to buskers for amplified sound. And you know in our last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2235)|
| 0:37:22| discussion about this, you said that in implementation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| this there would be flexibility. So maybe we'll get into a little bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2246)|
| 0:37:32| detail there. Currently there is an online application for a permit that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2252)|
| 0:37:37| would allow you to have amplified sound. That's correct. Okay, now this may not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| exactly set up for the purposes of a busker. Is that correct? That's right. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2261)|
| 0:37:47| but after implementing this you plan on making sure there is a permit that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| allow buskers to get amplified sound going through this process. We can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| that if we feel like there's a need to do that, yes. And I think there is a need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| to do that so I want to make sure I've stated that. I think that having an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| application online and making sure that there is a way for buskers or others to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| get that permit that's tailored for their specific use is critical for my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2289)|
| 0:38:18| support on this particular resolution. You know you can see in Cox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2298)|
| 0:38:28| versus New Hampshire, a Supreme Court case, that there are reasonable time, place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| and manner restrictions that are permissible. The government can regulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| contents of speech, cannot regulate contents of speech, and you and I talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| about that at length last time. There's no discussion about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2321)|
| 0:38:47| type of music, what content the speech would be in this ordinance. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| That's correct. Okay, and if it's done that way then reasonable time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| place and manner restrictions are allowed on that. And we're not prohibiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| anything here because you have an access to get a permit to have amplified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| sound. So I just wanted to make sure I was on record with you that I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2346)|
| 0:39:12| supportive of this only in the sense that we make sure that buskers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| others who might want to use amplified sound have access to flexibility with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2356)|
| 0:39:22| regard to that, have access to online application for that, and that we make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| sure we're making, we're not having a blanket ban on this. We're just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| asking folks to get a permit. Yeah, I agree with you totally. Thank you. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| you. Councilman Wallace. Thank you. So where did we get with the online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| application? We talked about it last time, but I don't think we were able to verify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| that that was. We have a special event permit. We'll have to tweak that permit. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| just talked to Judith Fultz in the special event office and we'll have to tweak that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| up to make it easier. That's more for the bigger events and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| the concerts and those things. So this is a little different animal. We'll have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| talk to the law department about how we go about doing that. So it'd be accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| online, pay online, so for somebody from out of town like this lady, then she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2403)|
| 0:40:11| could access it. I mean that's the intent, is that pay online, access it online, she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| gets the permit. Seems like that would be the best way to go, yes. I think as long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| as we have that flexibility, that's what we're talking about and I support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| it with that type of thing. If they violate that or you have to cite them for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| some reason, then you won't have to issue them a permit going forward, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| I'll just say we've had very few problems with buskers and this kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| issue. I don't know if we've ever cited anybody for amplification. If we get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| complaint, we'll say something and they're very good about quitting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| not doing anything. We talked about this last time and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| talked about this weekend about the citywide ban and you and KPD are adamant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2450)|
| 0:40:58| that there's no way to clearly define other than making it citywide. I mean we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2458)|
| 0:41:04| had a little, I had a little hesitation about it last time and I still have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| little bit of hesitation going citywide with it, but. Well it's just hard with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| mixed-use development we're supporting. As I said before, you know, if you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| the CBID, the CBID ends at the railroad track. So what about Riga Square? What| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| about Happy Holler? What about South Knoxville? I mean it's it's kind of hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| to know where activity is going to occur. We want it to be everywhere. Right. So it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| seems like that we ought to just go ahead and put a blanket regulation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| it covers all of downtown so officers aren't faced with trying to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| where the borders are when they're out in the street. Okay. Okay. Thank you Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| Thank you. Councilwoman Ryder. So the last time we discussed this two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| ago, number one, it was very, Chief Rausch made it very clear that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| application was to remain or would was to be free. That was my recollection and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| I can't even hear that. And I apologize, I'm having technical malfunctions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2511)|
| 0:42:01| Apparently all of our apps are crashing and I can't bring up the documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| that we had last time. Yes, we're having issues here. So I was trying to bring up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| from the last agenda meeting to look at it. We talked about decibel levels with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| Chief Rausch. As in the community the entire time I've been in here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2535)|
| 0:42:21| there's always been lots of complaints about noise ordinance and sound and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| talked about this being two separate issues because like the woman who spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| last brought up we have a lot of residents who will complain about noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| and I have folks who email me and Facebook message me about that issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| which is separate from what you're talking about. But we have to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2558)|
| 0:42:44| that as elected officials that this is what our constituents have asked us to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| able to have quiet and peace in their homes. But also I'm concerned if we pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| this tonight but we haven't fleshed out how the application process works. At one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2573)|
| 0:42:59| point we talked about it was free, then we talked about maybe it has a charge. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2579)|
| 0:43:05| we pass it tonight on second reading it is in effect tomorrow morning business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| day, is that correct? And so what are we doing this weekend when a busker wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| to play this weekend? So that's kind of I'm concerned about the order and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| timing of things going down that pathway and I guess because I can't pull it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2599)|
| 0:43:26| up what the what the discussion was about decibels if that only applied to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| folks complaining about noise in their homes on maybe private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2611)|
| 0:43:41| I don't know did somebody want to answer my question? Is there any...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| Actually Chief Roush has joined us he is still the police chief through Friday so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| we'll let him answer some of the questions. We're gonna work you from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| till Friday. I'm happy to do it. He's leaving right before the big festivals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2636)|
| 0:44:03| and cycling events this weekend. So I've heard it I heard the majority of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2643)|
| 0:44:09| you had and so I would tell you a couple of things that I found out since the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| last meeting in terms of you know the process and how it's done. So the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| application is online it can be submitted through email and and then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2658)|
| 0:44:25| the approval process the way it works is of course it's through special events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| and they send it to us to make the approvals on the on the on the the noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| variances and so our special events lieutenant in charge of traffic services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2675)|
| 0:44:42| handles those approvals and so that that's the process to get it approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| There is an application fee with that with that request as I understand to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2687)|
| 0:44:55| to cover the the administrative costs to to take care of it. I don't know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2695)|
| 0:45:02| that cost is. I apologize I didn't write that down and so the... Judith do you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2702)|
| 0:45:10| what it says? It's $50. Okay for larger events so we're not actually ready. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2710)|
| 0:45:18| don't have a price for I guess I'm kind of looking to staff right now on if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2718)|
| 0:45:26| are actually Dr. Lyons. No we haven't prepared such a form yet and and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2726)|
| 0:45:33| was something we were going to get into at implementation I think we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| looking to either lower minimal costs for a permit for an individual like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| but it hasn't been prepared yet that's something we committed to to working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| So here's what I would like there are several questions here what I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| to do is ask council to defer this. Yes. What's the proper motion? One month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2747)|
| 0:45:55| Postpone? Defer? What's the question? Postpone. One month so so we can actually work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2755)|
| 0:46:04| through you got share all of your questions with us let's make a Bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2764)|
| 0:46:11| Lyons the point person on this okay Bill and he'll get all the right people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| together so the questions that you have send them individually to a bill so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2775)|
| 0:46:21| we're not violating any sunshine law stuff and and then we can make sure we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| work through and have all those answers for you I'm not comfortable listening to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180619?start=2786)|
