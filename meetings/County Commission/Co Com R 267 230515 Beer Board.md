| 1418.02 | 1426.02 | That, again, I could take it up there, but a letter from the board would probably carry way more weight than my word.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1418.02)            |

| 1634.02 | 1644.02 | Just to clarify, is the mechanism, the license holder has a right to appear,                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1634.02)            |
| 1644.02 | 1652.02 | so someone would need to add that to the agenda and have the clerk send notice to them saying,                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1644.02)            |
| 1652.02 | 1661.02 | say, the June agenda, there is a resolution or a motion to suspend your beer permit                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1652.02)            |
| 1661.02 | 1665.02 | so they can come defend themselves, so to speak.                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1661.02)            |
| 1665.02 | 1668.02 | Under that line of the statute, yes, you'd have to give them notice.                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1665.02)            |
| 1668.02 | 1673.02 | Would that be a resolution or would that just be an agenda item, consideration of?                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1668.02)            |
| 1673.02 | 1676.02 | I think it could just be, or you could do it right here.                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1673.02)            |
| 1676.02 | 1681.02 | I think you could make a motion for the law director and the sheriff to, there we go.                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1676.02)            |

| 1769.02 | 1776.02 | you're actually saying that's a sheriff's office report and not a city of Knoxville police report or what actually?                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1769.02)            |
