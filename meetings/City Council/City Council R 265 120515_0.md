| 0:01:29| Okay. We've got a quorum. We've got everybody here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=89)|
| 0:01:33| Is there a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=93)|
| 0:01:36| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=97)|
| 0:01:40| Any opposed? The ayes have it. The minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=100)|
| 0:01:44| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=104)|
| 0:01:48| Any for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=108)|
| 0:01:49| Yes. Madam Mayor, I'd like to make the motion to postpone 9A, B, and C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=109)|
| 0:01:56| which pertain obviously to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| Just for those in TV land and the audience here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=120)|
| 0:02:03| we approved the budget as we traditionally do on first reading at the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=123)|
| 0:02:08| and obviously we have some diligence to do on the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| so we need to postpone this for at least two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=132)|
| 0:02:16| And that would be my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=136)|
| 0:02:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=138)|
| 0:02:19| Okay. We have a motion and a second to postpone 9A, B, and C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=139)|
| 0:02:23| Are there more postponements? Do we need to do those individually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=143)|
| 0:02:26| Okay. So we've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=146)|
| 0:02:28| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=148)|
| 0:02:30| Any opposed? The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| And those are postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=152)|
| 0:02:35| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=155)|
| 0:02:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| I'd like to go ahead and postpone 9D, which has to do with the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=157)|
| 0:02:43| I thought that at our last council meeting, or the council meeting of April 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| that when I withdrew it that that was what was happening at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| But I understand procedurally, since this was to come back up in six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| is the reason it is on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| But I would like to postpone it for four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=177)|
| 0:03:00| The assigned task force has been meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| We've been meeting every two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=183)|
| 0:03:05| and do want to announce that we have a public forum tomorrow night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=185)|
| 0:03:10| That will be at the KCDC headquarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| And I want to encourage all folks that want to participate in helping us to formulate the sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=193)|
| 0:03:22| or to review the sign ordinance to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| But I would like to make a motion that we postpone this for four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| Okay. We have a motion and a second to postpone 9D for four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| Can we discuss that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| We have been meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| I'm vice chair of that with Duane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=218)|
| 0:03:41| And it's a really, really, really involved process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=221)|
| 0:03:47| And this is what I found out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| I mean, the zoning is so intertwined with sign regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=228)|
| 0:03:54| that it's almost impossible to extrapolate one out from the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=234)|
| 0:03:59| We've met. We've had a lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| But it's a very, very complex deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| And I've gone back and read what was charged to that task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| And I hope that we can come back in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| We meet tomorrow night. We meet every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=253)|
| 0:04:15| So we can come back in two weeks and get back on to really what we've been charged with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| And that's to kind of look at some sign heights, make some tweaks to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| And if it's an overhaul that we want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| then we might consider that at another time in another strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| But it's very, very complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| It's not simple at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| And we've spent a lot of time so far swirling around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| But hopefully we're going to make some progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| I hope it's not going to take four months, Duane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| I mean, just to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| But, I mean, I'm hoping it's going to be more like 90 days that we get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| It's gotten a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| As some of you know, as far as being involved with any kind of ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| it's gotten a lot more complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| And we're really trying to search and feel it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| And it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=300)|
| 0:05:01| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| Well, I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| But, yes, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| I think if I recall when we postponed this six months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| we thought that there would be something from the sign ordinance committee tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| So we feel your pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| Well, we've got to dive in, you look at it, and you see how complicated it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| And it really came to a really stark reality last week when we met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| and that this is really, really complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| And it's a lot more complicated than I think we set out to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| And it's a lot more complicated, actually, than what we've been charged to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| And when you go back and see what city council asked us to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| if we can get back to that, I think we can come back and have something wrapped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| That's my hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| And I'll just add one other comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| What is good is the group that we have together, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| they've met every one of the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| And they're really a dedicated, hardworking group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| And it's been interesting in terms of where everyone's coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| in terms of the people on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| But it's quite a task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| But we're doing the best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| So the motion is to postpone for four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=373)|
| 0:06:15| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=378)|
| 0:06:19| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| Any other items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| Items to be added by motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| And there are no consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| So we are now on the mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| I do want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=392)|
| 0:06:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| I have one note, which is that next week, May 20th to the 25th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=404)|
| 0:06:50| is National Public Works Week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| Council and all are invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| We will have an event with our Public Works employees to recognize this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=415)|
| 0:07:02| National Public Works Week on Monday, the 21st, at 2.30 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=422)|
| 0:07:08| at Lorain Street, the Lorain Street Public Works Complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| We invite you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| And I was also going to call on our director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| senior director of Public Works, to make a few comments about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| This will be a great opportunity to recognize the hard work that goes on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| in Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| Actually, there's 1,559 employees that work for the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=445)|
| 0:07:28| and 457 of those actually work in Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| And those departments include engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| permits and inspections and zoning, includes parks and rec,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| and also includes public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| So if you have an opportunity to come out just to recognize some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| people who work through the day and through the night a lot of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| I know that they would appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| So we look forward to seeing you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=468)|
| 0:07:51| Thank you, Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| And the other thing I was going to announce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=472)|

| 0:16:19| The part that was really interesting was that you're partnering with Oak Ridge National Lab,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| and I guess they have all that stuff there to help you figure out how to get the bad guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=983)|

| 0:17:32| Yes, I just wanted to thank the administration for looking into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| We spoke to the neighbors in the Fairmont-Emerland area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| and, of course, they were thrilled that some of the flooding has been addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| and the pizza hut is gone, and they were concerned that maybe it would go back to some commercial use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1067)|

| 0:17:56| and save the entrance to their historic neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| So they're very appreciative and I want to thank the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| Yes, I'd like to recognize Ann Wallace from the Office of Redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1083)|

| 0:19:09| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| We've got some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| I had a discussion with Mr. York and maybe he'd like to come up and explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1154)|
| 0:19:20| Several of the questions that came up was in terms of the $10 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| the second paragraph, that if you would just explain to us for the general public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1164)|
| 0:19:30| in terms of the general funds and how that money is coming out and what it leaves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| and that sort of thing, like the discussion we had on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| Jim York, Finance Director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| First thing, let me just note that there is a typo that needs to be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| Former Councilmember Frost pointed it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| It's the last line of Section 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| It should read $1,332,900.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| The numbers are all there, but the commas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| Comma here, comma there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| This budget amendment is basically in three pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| They're all sizable pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| Let me explain that, and then I'll get to Councilmember Grave's questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1212)|
| 0:20:18| The first part of the amendment is technical in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| The city has just completed a bond refunding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| and as a result of that, we will be retiring roughly $91.75 million in debt this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1227)|
| 0:20:38| and we are amending the budget to show that in this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1238)|
| 0:20:44| The funds for that will come from the refunded bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| So, again, this is fairly technical in nature, but it's fairly large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| That affects our debt service fund to the tune of roughly $47 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| and our convention center fund by roughly $45.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1257)|
| 0:21:05| The second piece relates to the paving project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1265)|
| 0:21:11| When we did the budget, we did not expect any funding from KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| KUB is asked to participate in our paving contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| and they will be paying $1,332,900 towards that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1281)|
| 0:21:29| Again, and so we are amending the paving portion of the budget to reflect those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1289)|
| 0:21:39| The third piece is we are proposing to transfer $10 million from the general fund to the city pension system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1299)|
| 0:21:51| We are proposing to do that because we currently have a significant liability in the pension system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| We would like to reduce that liability and reduce that prior to June 30th of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1316)|
| 0:22:03| If we miss that deadline, then the impact of any contribution would not take place until fiscal year 14-15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1323)|
| 0:22:13| By doing it now prior to the end of the year, we can have some sort of impact on the FY 13-14 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1333)|
| 0:22:21| Council Member Grieve wanted me to talk about where we stand in terms of our fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| As of June 30th of last year, the city's fund balance was roughly $65 million, of which $27.8 million was unassigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1346)|
| 0:22:40| The rest of it was either unspendable, committed, or restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| The $10 million will be coming from the unassigned portion of fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1365)|
| 0:22:53| We have the city has policies in place that says that we will maintain a fund balance of at least 20% of our general fund operating budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1373)|
| 0:23:06| and we prefer to have that higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| Again, unofficial designation is at least 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1389)|
| 0:23:15| The $10 million, taking the $10 million out of fund balance, we will still be above that threshold at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1395)|
| 0:23:26| In terms of impact, we do not think it will have any impact on our bond ratings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| Again, we just went to the bond rating agencies, had all our ratings affirmed at AAA and AA plus and AA1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1410)|
| 0:23:40| We expect that will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| The reason being is because we are basically addressing a liability on behalf of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1423)|
| 0:23:49| and we think that that is a responsible position to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1429)|
| 0:23:57| Again, I'm not sure what types of questions you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| I just have two additional questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| The 20% that you talk about that we need to have, is that from the total general fund of $65 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1444)|
| 0:24:12| or is it from just the unassigned, the $28 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| The committed piece, or the 20%, would be of the total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| So, for example, as of June 30th of this year, the committed piece is going to be somewhere around $36 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1459)|
| 0:24:28| and we will still have an unassigned fund balance at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1468)|
| 0:24:34| It will probably be less than where it was a year ago, but we'll still be above our 20% even after taking the $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1474)|
| 0:24:43| And I think you said as we were talking that the liability that we have in the pension plan is $150 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1483)|
| 0:24:50| Well, again, the actuarial liability is somewhere significantly greater than our assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1490)|
| 0:25:02| Market assets were last year about $468 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1502)|
| 0:25:09| Our liability is up in the $600,000 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| So we're talking about $100, $120, $130 million liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1514)|
| 0:25:21| The $10 million does not clearly solve the total discrepancy in the liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1521)|
| 0:25:31| What it will have is it will have an impact on your future contributions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| because what we're doing is we're going to be able to reduce that liability by $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1537)|
| 0:25:43| And whatever that liability is at the end of this year will be $10 million less than what it would ordinarily be without this contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1543)|
| 0:25:52| And what that will do is it will have an impact on your future contributions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| because, again, it's just like if you were to think of it as amortizing on your mortgage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| whatever you prepay can be used to reduce your future payments going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| And that's what will happen as a result of this contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| Is there a certain percentage that it reduces it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| Well, again, I don't know where the valuation is going to be at year end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| I wish I did, but I don't have that clear crystal ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| I suspect that it's going to be, again, probably on the order of $120 million to $130 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1584)|
| 0:26:33| But what it will do, and, again, I'm just doing this because I haven't worked with the actuary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| I'm guessing that this contribution could lower the annual payment by several hundred thousand a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1599)|
| 0:26:45| And you're looking at several hundred thousand over the life of this pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| So, you know, it really has a significant payback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| because what you're doing is you're getting the multipliers with the interest rate assumptions and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| But also, and just to be clear, for the 2012-2013, we have in the budget $14.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1620)|
| 0:27:09| Okay. This contribution will have no impact on the 2012-2013 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| It's on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| It will have effect on the 2013-2014 budget and subsequent budgets, but will have no impact on the 2012-2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1637)|
| 0:27:25| The amount that's allocated or budgeted for pension contribution in 2012-2013, the budget that's upcoming, is $14.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1645)|
| 0:27:35| That is roughly $2.2 million more than it was in the current year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1655)|
| 0:27:42| Okay. How much did we have in the budget this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| We had roughly $12.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| Okay. And then 2013-2014, we're looking at $21 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| And, again, making a whole bunch of different assumptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| and we're looking somewhere on the order of $21 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| Councilman Dellavapi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| Jim, I appreciate the work that you have been doing to try to solve this problem, because it's a big one and it's a long-term one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1689)|
| 0:28:17| My concern, I guess, is if we put the $10 million in now up front, the current pension plan seems to take a fair amount of risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1697)|
| 0:28:29| with a 60 percent stock position and 20 percent in hedge fund and other kinds of real estate and other kinds of investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1709)|
| 0:28:37| And the stock market has been going down in the last eight to ten days, maybe six or seven percent already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1717)|
| 0:28:44| where it was just a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| I mean, timing is the question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| If we put it in the general pot and it's in stocks and other things and they go down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| we run the risk of losing some part of that $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| Right now it's sitting in bonds and treasuries and all kinds of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| and these very safe investments that you manage for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| Isn't that fair to say that you have it in very staid investment-type vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1747)|
| 0:29:14| We invest in very, very short-term bonds and agencies of the U.S. government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1754)|
| 0:29:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| So they're prudent investments in terms of not diminishing in size much, even if they're not earning a ton of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1763)|
| 0:29:31| Trust me, we're not earning a ton of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| So my question is, as an alternative, are you better off sort of appropriating this money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| but using it to pay that big hump that's coming next year when we go from 14 to 20 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1780)|
| 0:29:48| Wouldn't that be a safer way to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| Or alternatively, putting it in the pension fund with the stipulation that it be put in some type of secure bonding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1790)|
| 0:29:58| so that it doesn't go in and then diminish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| Our portfolio in the pension plan is roughly 55 percent equities, 45 percent other types of investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1803)|
| 0:30:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| And, again, I don't know where we're overweighted and where we're underweighted in relationship to those kind of standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1811)|
| 0:30:20| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| What you will have, and, again, none of us know where we're going to be as of June 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1821)|
| 0:30:29| it's possible that we could put $10 million in and we may not have $10 million, you know, at the end of June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1829)|
| 0:30:38| That's a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| But we will still have significantly more than where we would if we were not to take this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1841)|
| 0:30:49| So, for example, if you were to put $10 million in and lose 5 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| you still have $9.5 million more in the portfolio of the pension system than you would otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1854)|
| 0:31:03| And that has a significant multiplier effect going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1863)|
| 0:31:10| I understand the logic that you explained to Dwayne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| I'm just saying, is there some place to put it in a safe vehicle in the pension fund so that it's there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| and it's still there at the end of the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| Again, I'm a believer that there are absolutely no perfectly safe investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1881)|
| 0:31:28| Mason jar in your backyard, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| I'm not even sure how safe that is these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| But what you could do, you know, if it goes into a bond fund or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1893)|
| 0:31:41| there's still a possibility that you could lose money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| There's also the upside risk that you could gain that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| in which case you even have a better situation by taking this step now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| And, again, I can't tell you where the market's going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| With regard to the second part of that, what about using it to make the large shortfall jump for next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1922)|
| 0:32:09| that you know is coming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| Well, again, we're going to, as we do this, we're going to be working with our actuaries to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| and do some things to address that increase that's going to come up next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1936)|
| 0:32:22| The best thing that we can do is maybe delay it portionally or, you know, some sort of proportionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| But you're still going to have a significant increase either next year or the year thereafter or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1948)|
| 0:32:36| We all know what's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| I just was pointing that out and wondering if there wasn't, you know, a better way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| But you're in charge of that, so go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| Jim, like we talked about, I mean, I share some of the same concerns that Nick does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1970)|
| 0:32:56| And, I mean, you're giving $10 million to the pension plan that you have no control over how it's invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1976)|
| 0:33:03| And I guess that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| I mean, you don't even, I mean, and we talked about and you suggested that maybe there's a possibility that you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1987)|
| 0:33:14| And I just think to turn it over $10 million, cash is king.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| And you can never have enough cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| And businesses are very, that's what's been, has made businesses survive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| and it's what's made businesses fail is the lack of cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| And I think you could set it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| I applaud the effort to be proactive and set aside $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| I wonder if you could set it aside in an account and still get the value of having the cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| But turning it over to the pension board where you have no control over it and we have no control over it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| I just think it's a bit too risky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| I just, I don't know that I agree that that's what's best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| Well, I mean, and again, as we've discussed, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| I'm also one that believes that you like to have as much cash as you possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2035)|
| 0:34:01| What we're trying to do is we're trying to address a significant issue in terms of the pension fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| Now, when this goes over, and we're probably going to dollar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| try to dollar cost average this one over the next, you know, number of pay periods once this is passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2050)|
| 0:34:18| So we're probably talking, you're going to have a significant amount of cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2058)|
| 0:34:24| You know, this will go directly into cash and it won't be immediately rolled into the various investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2064)|
| 0:34:31| I mean, we'll take, you know, that just takes some time to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| And we're going to dollar cost average into the portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| If you were, and again, it has to do with timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| If you were to not, you know, let's say we keep it in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| We do not capture the benefit until 13-14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| And I mean, excuse me, until 14-15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| And what we're trying to do is reduce that liability at the end of this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| and have some significant impact or an impact on the 13-14 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2099)|
| 0:35:06| You know, that's a year off, but again, it's a step we have to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| If we miss that June 30th deadline, then we're waiting until 14-15 before we will see any impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2110)|
| 0:35:18| So, again, and in terms of investments, again, there's risk in everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| There's, you know, even risk in holding cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| But I think this is a reasonable risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2126)|
| 0:35:32| Now, again, it may go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| It may go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| I can't tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| But I still think we will be in much better condition by taking this step than we would if we failed to take this step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2137)|
| 0:35:45| Are there certain limitations that you are restricted because it is city money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2145)|
| 0:35:53| You're restricted in how aggressively you can invest it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| Are you restricted by that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| The city, you know, has an investment policy just like the pension board has an investment policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| Our investment policy is guided, you know, more by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| And we are very restricted in what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| We can't go out more than four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| We have certain things we can invest in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| We can't invest in equities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| We can't invest in corporate bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| So we're fairly restricted in what we can invest in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| Most of our funds are actually held in a state pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| The rest of them are held in various municipal bonds of short duration or agencies of the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2192)|
| 0:36:41| Say, for example, federal home loan bank, federal farm credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| So, again, very, very restricted there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| But by the same token, what that does is you don't capture those assumed multipliers in the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2207)|
| 0:36:55| I know this, you know, the assumed multiplier, whether you agree, you know, seven and three-eighths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2215)|
| 0:37:01| Whatever we do will flow and use that multiplier rather than what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2221)|
| 0:37:08| And we feel ecstatic when we can get, you know, 60 basis points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| Or if we get 1%, we think we've died and gone to heaven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| So, again, you've got to look at the way the multipliers work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| And once you put it in the pension plan, you will capture that assumed rate of return for actuarial purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2241)|
| 0:37:29| And that's going to affect your contribution in FY13-14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2249)|
| 0:37:36| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| I think some of these concerns were touched on last night in our conversation about pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2259)|
| 0:37:46| And the board, the pension board, is looking very hard at de-risking, as Alan Pennington alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2266)|
| 0:37:53| And I will remind council that Mr. York and myself and the mayor are on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2273)|
| 0:37:59| And we are very aware, very aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| And I suspect, from my experience, the rest of the board is also as aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| And we are struggling with that to reduce our risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| So we're not in any mood to take a whole lot of risk either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| Nevertheless, there is some risk in the portfolio now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| And as Jim indicated, this will not be immediately invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| It takes a good while to make that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| What is a good while, if I can answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| It may be three or four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2305)|
| 0:38:31| Let me get back to Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| Mr. York, I referred to you as Jim No-York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| And I think other councilmembers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| I take that as a compliment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| I knew you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| I think he's probably the most conservative money person I've encountered in a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| So I feel confident that if Mr. York and the mayor are making this recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2330)|
| 0:38:58| this was not entered into lightly or in a foolhardy manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| that it was very thoughtful and every conceivable outcome was weighed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| If we look at the stock market on a daily, hourly, minute-to-minute basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2347)|
| 0:39:12| we can either have a heart attack, dance with joy, or whatever we need to do, depending on the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2352)|
| 0:39:18| But I will say that I have quite a bit of confidence in a recommendation that Mr. York would bring to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2358)|
| 0:39:25| And so I will be supporting this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| As with everyone else, I have concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| But I have concerns with my money in my bank account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| So, you know, it's one of those things that you just have to take a deep breath and deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| No Greek bonds, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| No Greek bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| Councilman Graydon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| Jim, I want to make sure that I understand part of what Councilman Della Vopi had to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| and then also Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| If we take the $10 million, then for this year we're actually contributing to the pension plan with what's already in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2392)|
| 0:40:00| the $22,200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| And so next year we're looking at $14.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| And you said that if we put the money in now, I understand what you're saying about how it compounds itself in terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2410)|
| 0:40:17| But if we wait until next year, do you know what the difference is between waiting for next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| versus taking that $10 million, as Councilman Wallace is saying, which we know is cash and we need, and keeping it invested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2422)|
| 0:40:29| I mean, what's my answer to what I'm trying to ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| We just use, let's just talk about what we would assume the rate to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| because that's what you have to do is you have to take it on the assumed rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| And the difference between what the city could invest it at and what the pension board could invest it at is on the order of $700,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2443)|
| 0:40:55| you know, basically forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| Because you're assuming a seven and three-eighths return again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| And that doesn't mean you're going to get seven, three-eighths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| You may get 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| You may get six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| We don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| But for actuarial computations, you use the seven and three-eighths discount rate and investment return rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2470)|
| 0:41:19| Now, and again, what you're looking at there is, and what we could probably invest it in, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| to be quite honest with you, is probably on the order of 25 basis points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| So, you know, less than one-quarter of one percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| So the difference between what we can invest in and what you gain by putting it in the pension system is $700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2492)|
| 0:41:40| And, again, that not only takes place next year, that takes place the subsequent year and each year thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2500)|
| 0:41:47| So, again, what we're trying to do is use that spread, capture that spread, and have an impact on the 13-14 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2507)|
| 0:42:00| Well, I guess part of what I'm asking then, too, is that we think, we're not sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2520)|
| 0:42:06| but for the 2013-14 budget, we're going to have to come up with $21 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2526)|
| 0:42:12| And so, and Councilman Palmer, I also greatly respect Jim Noe also since he told me no two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2532)|
| 0:42:21| Several times he's told me no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| But what do you see as far as coming up with the $21 million next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2543)|
| 0:42:29| Again, what we're looking at, and the Mayor may want to look at, we're looking at ways to try and address the issue next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2549)|
| 0:42:38| And this is one of those things that we are looking at as one part of the overall strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2558)|
| 0:42:45| But it's something that we're trying to do and we're trying to capture it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| And, again, I hate to keep harping on the point, but if you miss that 6-30 deadline, you've lost this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2568)|
| 0:42:56| This is one step in that piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| You know, in terms of next year, we've still got to address the 12-13 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| You know, we'll start working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| You know, we're currently discussing 13-14, but it's, you know, a little bit off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2589)|
| 0:43:16| Remember, it's an additional 7-point-whatever-million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| It's not 20-plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| I mean, it's not an additional $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| It's on top of what we're doing this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| It's an additional 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| It's still significant, but remember, that's the increase next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| The increase of 7 million on top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| But it's possible, again, that you might be coming back asking that that money come out of the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| Well, we know what's going to happen next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| And, again, I can't tell you whether it's going to be 21, 20, 22, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| That's spread across all funds, most of which are either in the general fund or subsidized by the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| So it's going to be primarily general fund dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| But, again, what we're trying to do is address that, reduce that liability, which has an impact on what we have to contribute in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2636)|
| 0:44:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| Does it make sense to put more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| Well, again, what you're doing is we talked about our policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| and we're trying to work this within the framework of our policies and still stay consistent to our policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2651)|
| 0:44:19| And I talked about the rating agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| One of the things they look at is how consistent are we going to stay with our policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| So if we start deviating from those policies and dipping below that, then I think we've got other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2666)|
| 0:44:32| And we still have to have, you know, this fund for cash flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2672)|
| 0:44:38| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| I had a question and a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| I had talked with our actuary, Alan Pennington, about how it would affect our annual contribution, and he said it depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2682)|
| 0:44:49| He said it could be spread out over a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| or it could be weighted for sort of the near future and really affect those years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| Is there a plan on how it's going to affect the contribution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| Again, what we're doing, we're trying to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| We're still going to be talking to the actuary on what we think the best way to address that issue is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2703)|
| 0:45:12| We know that there are some options, and, again, we've kind of discussed those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| but we haven't arrived at what we think is the best solution on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| But we do think that this gives us some flexibility in dealing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2720)|
| 0:45:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| I mean, I plan on supporting this, but to me it's very painful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| And I hope the rest of council and the public realize, I mean, $10 million is, I think it's over 5% of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2732)|
| 0:45:40| I mean, it's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| You know, we have these campaigns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| We talk about these things we want to do for the city, these redevelopment projects we all care about, the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2745)|
| 0:45:52| sidewalks, roads, more police patrols, all these things we want for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2752)|
| 0:45:58| And instead of being able to do some of those things, we have to fund this problem we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2758)|
| 0:46:05| And to me, the basic reason why we have this problem is because we took we have a pension program that takes risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2765)|
| 0:46:13| and we're paying for those risks with this $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| And the big disappointment to me is instead of developing a plan that eliminates those risks for the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2777)|
| 0:46:24| we're creating a plan that puts more risk on the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| So that's my opinion, but I'll be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| Jim, you might also comment, because this is the other side of the coin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| When you refinance this, aren't we experiencing a significant savings of the $90 million, $95 million, whatever it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2801)|
| 0:46:49| As part of the refunding, we were able to capture roughly $18.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2809)|
| 0:46:57| That's nominal, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| Roughly $1.4 million a year through 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2821)|
| 0:47:07| The percentage, and this is probably only means something to people in the finance area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2827)|
| 0:47:14| As a percent of outstanding principal, if we calculate this on a present value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| we were able to capture just under 18 percent savings, which is extraordinary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| in terms of how much savings we were able to capture as a percentage of refunding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| That was my point, that we're not just having the expense here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| We're having huge savings as part of this package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| Yes, Mr. York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| I think I heard you say in your remarks that this would not have a negative effect on our bond rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| Is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| I do not expect that it will have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| I don't think it's going to have any impact on our bond rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| I'm sure if you did, you wouldn't be here supporting it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| But I'm going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| I'm concerned about the $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| But I think that you wouldn't be proposing this if you had not looked at it very carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2886)|
| 0:48:15| So I plan to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| This will be my last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| I think we also talked, Jim, that out of the general fund, though, there is some monies coming for some capital improvements, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2900)|
| 0:48:28| The proposal in the 12-13, there is $2.6 million in appropriated fund balance that is proposed for the State Street garage improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2908)|
| 0:48:40| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| And then we can, through the course of the year, have some additional conversations on greenways and parks and trees and sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2922)|
| 0:48:49| I'm sure that we will have additional conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2931)|
| 0:48:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| I'm going to support this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2933)|
| 0:48:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| Let's call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2939)|

| 0:49:12| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2952)|

| 0:49:14| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2955)|
| 0:49:16| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2957)|
| 0:49:18| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2958)|

| 0:49:20| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2961)|
| 0:49:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2962)|
| 0:49:23| The motion passes 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| 12-B is an ordinance changing the date of the regularly scheduled beer board and city council meetings from December 25, 2012 to December 20, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2966)|
| 0:49:36| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| The aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| There's one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| We have one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| I'll be here Christmas Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| Would you like me to explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| Would you like to explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| Well, we didn't do it last year either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| And there's a good chance that it will be a very, very short meeting with a lot of people absent, a lot of the city employees on vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=2994)|
| 0:50:02| And I just think that it's one of those meetings that we don't need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| Now, I agree we don't need it on Christmas Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| But even last year it didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| So I just say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| And I know my colleague and esteemed Vice Mayor disagrees with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3011)|
| 0:50:17| I voted no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| And I do disagree with that because, you know, when we did that last year there was, and I couldn't recall right off the top of my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3018)|
| 0:50:25| but there was two or three issues that really needed to be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| And I'm just not a big fan of missing meetings, but particularly just discarding a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3029)|
| 0:50:36| I just can't go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| We also postponed the beer board last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| And I remember that we ended up with two beer board meetings in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| It got to be very confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| And there may be a huge flurry of activity in December or there may be no applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| But I do feel we have a responsibility to be present for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3054)|
| 0:51:00| I just want to say, Mayor, I'm certainly glad that my no did cause some conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3060)|
| 0:51:06| Thank you, my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| We really appreciate that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3067)|
| 0:51:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3068)|
| 0:51:09| I can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| 12C is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B, Zoning Regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3072)|
| 0:51:16| Article 2, Definitions, and Article 4, Section 3.12, TC, Town Center District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| to change provisions regarding permitted uses and other related ordinance provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3081)|
| 0:51:27| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3089)|
| 0:51:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| 12D is an ordinance to approve and adopt the Fiscal Year 2013-2018 Knoxville Capital Improvement Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3094)|
| 0:51:40| including FY2013 Capital Improvement Budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| I thought we traditionally discussed this, at least the current year's budget, at our capital budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3110)|
| 0:51:57| at our budget hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| Maybe I'm mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| I realize this is a great way to do it, that we have a six-year look with future planning stretched out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3121)|
| 0:52:08| so we understand what's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| And the current or the first upcoming year is the one that goes in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3130)|
| 0:52:16| But I didn't know that we actually approved it without some discussion or hearing other than this particular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3136)|
| 0:52:23| And I was just curious about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| Councilmember Dela Volpe, by charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| MPC is required to consider the capital improvement budget and the capital improvement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3152)|
| 0:52:41| And what we've done is we have prepared the capital budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| and we will be discussing the capital budget as part of the ongoing budget operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3165)|
| 0:52:50| But we are also required to present kind of a multi-year perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| It's a program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3175)|
| 0:52:56| It's a program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| And just because of the way the timing works out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| that's one of the reasons it wasn't considered at last agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| because MPC has a different kind of schedule than city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| Sometimes they go in concert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| This just happened to be one time where we couldn't meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| But this is all part and parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| This is an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| You will see it again in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| If you like, we'll be happy to discuss the entire capital plan at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3200)|
| 0:53:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3206)|
| 0:53:27| Well, I see a real distinction between the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| which does involve that long-range planning and looking ahead and trying to prioritize things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3210)|
| 0:53:36| We will have an opportunity then to discuss the current budget capital plan for the upcoming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3216)|
| 0:53:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| Well, that was really my interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3226)|
| 0:53:47| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| 12E is an emergency ordinance to rezone property located on the northwest side of Callahan Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3233)|

| 1:01:55| My second one is I'm against the sales tax for the school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3715)|
| 1:01:58| We have the highest tax in the state, other than Michigan, and a 5.5 groceries tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3718)|
| 1:02:03| I don't know if the city council is aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| And the superintendent was talking about a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3726)|

| 1:02:14| The media said that this city council approves of it, all right, and you support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3734)|
| 1:02:21| But my feeling is, as a taxpayer and as a citizen of Knoxville, I'm just concerned about the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3741)|
| 1:02:30| I mean, personally, I just think, you know, there has to be some other alternative to the sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3750)|
| 1:02:40| That's all I've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3760)|

| 1:02:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3766)|
| 1:02:47| There being no further business, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120515?start=3767)|
