| 0:00:30| Okay, it's 5 o'clock, so I'll bring this workshop to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=30.0)|
| 0:00:35| First up, we've got the Pledge of Allegiance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=35.0)|
| 0:00:38| by Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=38.0)|
| 0:00:44| Face the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=44.0)|
| 0:00:46| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=46.0)|
| 0:00:50| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=50.0)|
| 0:00:53| one nation under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=53.0)|
| 0:00:56| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=56.0)|
| 0:01:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=63.0)|
| 0:01:04| Today is April 27, 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=64.0)|
| 0:01:07| and Council is holding a workshop on CG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=67.0)|
| 0:01:11| General Commercial District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=71.0)|
| 0:01:13| We'd like to welcome Harold Cannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=73.0)|
| 0:01:16| the Chief Economic Development Officer for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=76.0)|
| 0:01:19| Jeff Welch, Executive Director of Knox County Planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=79.0)|
| 0:01:24| as well as Peter Ahrens and Brian Berry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=84.0)|
| 0:01:28| from the Plans Review and Inspection Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=88.0)|
| 0:01:33| Just by way of understanding what's going on today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=93.0)|
| 0:01:36| in November of 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=96.0)|
| 0:01:38| planning staff had recommended addressing challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=98.0)|
| 0:01:41| to the build-to percentage and build-to zone for properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=101.0)|
| 0:01:45| that were zoned in CG2 and CG3 along major arterial corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=105.0)|
| 0:01:52| Council sent that proposal back to planning for further study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=112.0)|
| 0:01:55| and discussion at a workshop, which brings us here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=115.0)|
| 0:01:59| By way of background, Council has provided CG2 and CG3 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=119.0)|
| 0:02:04| to encourage mixed-use development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=124.0)|
| 0:02:07| and add pedestrian-oriented spaces along our major arterials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=127.0)|
| 0:02:11| and other city streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=131.0)|
| 0:02:13| The challenge has been that TDOT controls many of these roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=133.0)|
| 0:02:17| and CG2 and CG3 may have been over-applied in areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=137.0)|
| 0:02:21| further from city center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=141.0)|
| 0:02:23| where the lot size and street frontage can't accommodate TDOT's curb cuts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=143.0)|
| 0:02:28| while also pulling the buildings to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=148.0)|
| 0:02:31| Council is reviewing these challenges today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=151.0)|
| 0:02:34| to make sure our zoning ordinance is working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=154.0)|
| 0:02:36| to encourage mixed-use development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=156.0)|
| 0:02:38| and provide pedestrian-oriented commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=158.0)|
| 0:02:41| where practical to ensure continued reinvestment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=161.0)|
| 0:02:44| and improvement in the CG districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=164.0)|
| 0:02:48| With that, I hope I said all that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=168.0)|
| 0:02:51| I'll turn it over to Harold Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=171.0)|
| 0:02:55| Vice Mayor, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=175.0)|
| 0:02:58| That was a perfect summary of why we're here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=178.0)|
| 0:03:01| I think part of what is feeding this is that we are blessed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=181.0)|
| 0:03:05| with remarkable growth through our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=185.0)|
| 0:03:09| We're also seeing a desire, as you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=189.0)|
| 0:03:12| to make sure we're giving attention to pedestrian-oriented travel, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=192.0)|
| 0:03:19| and that being incorporated into our zoning effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=199.0)|
| 0:03:24| What we will do is, with your permission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=204.0)|
| 0:03:28| Jeff Welch will speak to what was presented back in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=208.0)|
| 0:03:32| to council based upon Planning Commission action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=212.0)|
| 0:03:36| Brian Berry will then share some examples of where this may fit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=216.0)|
| 0:03:44| and obviously that is your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=224.0)|
| 0:03:47| We'll then bring a two-part recommendation to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=227.0)|
| 0:03:50| because we believe it will need to be taken in parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=230.0)|
| 0:03:54| Before we go much further in the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=234.0)|
| 0:03:57| because we're talking CG, I'll recognize Peter Ahrens to speak to CG1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=237.0)|
| 0:04:03| and some of the thought processes that are going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=243.0)|
| 0:04:06| I realize that's not necessarily what this meeting is about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=246.0)|
| 0:04:09| but with it being CG, we thought it would be appropriate to bring you up to date on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=249.0)|
| 0:04:15| With that, I'm going to turn it over to Jeff Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=255.0)|
| 0:04:19| Thank you, Harold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=259.0)|
| 0:04:21| The good summary, Mr. Vice Mayor, I think you took my first slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=261.0)|
| 0:04:25| so we're in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=265.0)|
| 0:04:26| We're moving along very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=266.0)|
| 0:04:28| Again, as what Vice Mayor Roberto indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=268.0)|
| 0:04:31| why we're here and the purpose of the CG2 and CG3, CG zoning districts are for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=271.0)|
| 0:04:40| Again, try to help with the definitions, which is going to be hard to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=280.0)|
| 0:04:44| The Bill 2 zone is the area of a lot where a structure might locate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=284.0)|
| 0:04:48| within the minimum and maximum range of setback provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=288.0)|
| 0:04:51| and the Bill 2 percentage specifies the percentage of the building façade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=291.0)|
| 0:04:55| that must be located within a building line to build zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=295.0)|
| 0:04:59| Then our major arterials, which I think you fully understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=299.0)|
| 0:05:01| those are pretty much our state highways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=301.0)|
| 0:05:04| and the purpose of major arterial is really to move traffic from our collector streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=304.0)|
| 0:05:12| and then move traffic for relatively long distances throughout our city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=312.0)|
| 0:05:19| So given the arterial street layout and length of many of these streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=319.0)|
| 0:05:22| the application of the Bill 2 zones and Bill percentages, after further consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=322.0)|
| 0:05:28| will not create a pedestrian-oriented environment along some of our major.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=328.0)|
| 0:05:33| When you're looking at Kingston Pike west of North Shore and that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=333.0)|
| 0:05:36| it's not an attractive built pedestrian environment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=336.0)|
| 0:05:40| And so we're looking at what we want to define as walkable areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=340.0)|
| 0:05:44| Walkable areas, you know, you have safe space, comfortable space to walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=344.0)|
| 0:05:49| attractiveness and a connectivity between your activity centers there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=349.0)|
| 0:05:54| connecting from an arterial to a collector or whatever, making it a very walkable area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=354.0)|
| 0:06:00| And, again, some of our arterials, the further you go outside the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=360.0)|
| 0:06:04| the central core are not, in that sense, a friendly walkable area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=364.0)|
| 0:06:10| and I don't think they ever will be for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=370.0)|
| 0:06:16| So the planning commission in their recommendation to city council was an add Section C to Article 5.3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=376.0)|
| 0:06:26| and that the NCG2 and CG3 jurisdictions along the following sections of the major arterial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=386.0)|
| 0:06:34| as shown on the map, Bill 2 percentages and Bill 2 zones do not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=394.0)|
| 0:06:40| So the areas that we're looking at, again, I'll show a map in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=400.0)|
| 0:06:43| but North Broadway, north of Ridgewood Road, Chapman Highway, south of Yonge High Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=403.0)|
| 0:06:49| Asheville Highway, east of Prosser Road, Kingston Pike, west of Bearden Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=409.0)|
| 0:06:54| and south North Shore Drive, east of White Tower Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=414.0)|
| 0:06:58| Again, these are parts of those major arterials that the Bill 2 percentages and Bill 2 zones will not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=418.0)|
| 0:07:08| So we make an exception for those sections of those major arterials that we feel that these are not attractive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=428.0)|
| 0:07:16| safe, walkable areas and will not be for the foreseeable future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=436.0)|
| 0:07:21| So these areas that are outlined in black are the definitions graphically showing where the Bill 2 zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=441.0)|
| 0:07:29| and the dimensional standards will not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=449.0)|
| 0:07:34| So, again, on Asheville Highway, Chapman Highway, south North Shore Drive, Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=454.0)|
| 0:07:40| and then North Broadway and Maryville Pike area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=460.0)|
| 0:07:44| With that, I'll entertain any questions or turn it over to Brian to give some specific examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=464.0)|
| 0:07:49| of some of those strategies and some of the real case situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=469.0)|
| 0:07:57| Council Member Sang.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=477.0)|
| 0:07:58| Thank you. Is this a list we're going to add to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=478.0)|
| 0:08:03| This is the list where we exempt the Bill 2 standards of these areas will be exempted in a C2 and CG3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=483.0)|
| 0:08:11| be exempted from those Bill 2 zones and Bill 2 percentages. Exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=491.0)|
| 0:08:16| But like I'm thinking about Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=496.0)|
| 0:08:19| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=499.0)|
| 0:08:20| Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=500.0)|
| 0:08:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=501.0)|
| 0:08:22| That feels like another area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=502.0)|
| 0:08:30| I can't recall why Clinton Highway was exempted, whether there was not that much C2, C3 zone through that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=510.0)|
| 0:08:36| So I don't have that. I'm sorry. I do not have a response for that, quite honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=516.0)|
| 0:08:44| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=524.0)|
| 0:08:45| Yeah, I just was going to comment that I have the map up and it looks like Western is CH1 and then Clinton Highway is commercial highway as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=525.0)|
| 0:08:57| Yes, mostly CH zone problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=537.0)|
| 0:09:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=541.0)|
| 0:09:03| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=543.0)|
| 0:09:04| Yes, Mr. Welch, how would exempting the requirements improve pedestrian access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=544.0)|
| 0:09:11| It would not. What we're saying is that the environment along these sections of the arterial that are highlighted on the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=551.0)|
| 0:09:19| are not going to be attractive for pedestrian-orientated commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=559.0)|
| 0:09:26| These sections that are highlighted on the maps are more auto-orientated corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=566.0)|
| 0:09:35| where you have a lot more vehicular traffic, a lot more development that is already heavily commercial and with drive-throughs and that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=575.0)|
| 0:09:47| So we do not predict having those areas be expanded out would be more walkable in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=587.0)|
| 0:09:54| So this would be exempted from those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=594.0)|
| 0:09:59| If I may interrupt, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=599.0)|
| 0:10:02| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=602.0)|
| 0:10:03| Council Member Thomas, what Jeff is presenting is what was brought before you the latter part of last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=603.0)|
| 0:10:11| and what was approved by the Planning Commission, what we would like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=611.0)|
| 0:10:14| And at that time it was basically a one-size-fits-all for these particular areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=614.0)|
| 0:10:21| With your patience with me, what we'd like to do is show examples of this and then we have a recommendation that builds on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=621.0)|
| 0:10:29| but it's not just a one-size-fits-all, if that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=629.0)|
| 0:10:34| That's fine. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=634.0)|
| 0:10:37| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=637.0)|
| 0:10:38| Well, so maybe I need to see what Mr. Cannon is planning to present because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=638.0)|
| 0:10:46| when you talk about Broadway north of Ridgewood, I feel like there are parts of Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=646.0)|
| 0:10:55| immediately, maybe even parts of Broadway immediately south of 640 and there are parts of Broadway that are north of 640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=655.0)|
| 0:11:06| I think the parts of Broadway that abut, or the parcels that abut Broadway where Hotel is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=666.0)|
| 0:11:14| like where the park is, are slightly different in their layout, walkability, that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=674.0)|
| 0:11:25| So making this cutoff at Ridgewood seems like it doesn't meet some of the differentials that we have on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=685.0)|
| 0:11:36| We agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=696.0)|
| 0:11:37| Am I making sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=697.0)|
| 0:11:38| You're making sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=698.0)|
| 0:11:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=699.0)|
| 0:11:40| And I think our recommendation is an attempt, and you all can guide us where you would like to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=700.0)|
| 0:11:46| but we're going to take it to another level to help address those areas, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=706.0)|
| 0:11:55| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=715.0)|
| 0:12:00| Mr. Welch, while we're talking about the district, in the CG district, all of the uses are the same, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=720.0)|
| 0:12:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=729.0)|
| 0:12:10| So all we're really talking about, we're not talking about a variety of different uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=730.0)|
| 0:12:14| we're talking about, I guess, the build-to zone, the build-to percentage would be different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=734.0)|
| 0:12:21| but then also the height of the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=741.0)|
| 0:12:23| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=743.0)|
| 0:12:25| The height would be yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=745.0)|
| 0:12:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=747.0)|
| 0:12:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=748.0)|
| 0:12:29| And it is, I'm sorry, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=749.0)|
| 0:12:32| No, no, you go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=752.0)|
| 0:12:33| I'm fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=753.0)|
| 0:12:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=754.0)|
| 0:12:35| But in each of these, what we've done with these zones is we're encouraging the ability to do a mixed-use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=755.0)|
| 0:12:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=763.0)|
| 0:12:44| And what we're really talking about is that for the largest part of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=764.0)|
| 0:12:50| which we see is not highlighted with the kind of bold line on those arterials, that whole area is considered more walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=770.0)|
| 0:13:01| And as you get further away from city center where traffic is more oriented toward vehicles as opposed to pedestrian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=781.0)|
| 0:13:10| what I got from your discussion was that in those areas it is not friendly to pedestrian traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=790.0)|
| 0:13:19| nor do you expect it to be any time soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=799.0)|
| 0:13:22| In most of those corridors, you begin to see as you go further west, northeast, or south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=802.0)|
| 0:13:27| that you see the massive parking lots in front of the food city or the Kmart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=807.0)|
| 0:13:33| or abandoned Kmart or Westtown Mall where, you know, it's just not a great place to walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=813.0)|
| 0:13:39| and you're further distanced from any of the developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=819.0)|
| 0:13:42| We just don't see that redeveloping as quickly as we would hope to see in these other corridors closer to the inner city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=822.0)|
| 0:13:48| where we are seeing continued redevelopment out of the central core, you know, central city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=828.0)|
| 0:13:54| As you see with Cumberland Avenue, you know, that is being developed, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=834.0)|
| 0:13:59| redeveloped significantly over the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=839.0)|
| 0:14:02| So we can see that this will continue to out these corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=842.0)|
| 0:14:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=848.0)|
| 0:14:09| Now, along these same areas that we're talking about in the bold, those are controlled by TDOT, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=849.0)|
| 0:14:16| All these highways are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=856.0)|
| 0:14:17| Access is controlled by TDOT and, you know, City of Knoxville in cooperation with TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=857.0)|
| 0:14:22| but they have their access policies that are quite stringent and you can seek exceptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=862.0)|
| 0:14:29| but those exceptions are very difficult and time-consuming to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=869.0)|
| 0:14:34| And just from my looking, and I just wanted your thoughts on this too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=874.0)|
| 0:14:39| a lot of the lots that are in, you know, these areas that we're highlighting, they're not exactly larger lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=879.0)|
| 0:14:47| They're more smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=887.0)|
| 0:14:48| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=888.0)|
| 0:14:49| Closer to the inner city, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=889.0)|
| 0:14:51| So you've got, if you've got limited frontage in a smaller, you know, area that you're working with and TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=891.0)|
| 0:15:02| I think you have to get their permission not only from the city for your permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=902.0)|
| 0:15:06| but you also get permission from TDOT as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=906.0)|
| 0:15:10| Can you find yourself in a position where you can't, you know, do what you're wanting to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=910.0)|
| 0:15:17| because you're going to have a curb cut that is going to be mandated to you where it's going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=917.0)|
| 0:15:24| Can that be a challenge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=924.0)|
| 0:15:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=926.0)|
| 0:15:27| Obviously it is a challenge just to meet their standards, particular TDOT standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=927.0)|
| 0:15:31| because their standards fit across this entire state, whether you're, you know, a Memphis or a Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=931.0)|
| 0:15:37| it's the same standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=937.0)|
| 0:15:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=938.0)|
| 0:15:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=939.0)|
| 0:15:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=940.0)|
| 0:15:41| I thought I saw another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=941.0)|
| 0:15:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=942.0)|
| 0:15:43| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=943.0)|
| 0:15:44| Yes, just for clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=944.0)|
| 0:15:45| The entire length of Broadway is under TDOT's control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=945.0)|
| 0:15:48| The entire length of Broadway, Hall of Fame, Broadway is entire TDOT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=948.0)|
| 0:15:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=953.0)|
| 0:15:55| Well, I should say Broadway when you, not Broadway here from Fifth Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=955.0)|
| 0:16:01| but up to where it converts over to Hall of Fame, that is TDOT's control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=961.0)|
| 0:16:09| So Broadway through the Fourth and Gill area down to basically down to Henley Street there is not TDOT controlled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=969.0)|
| 0:16:20| So it's state controlled, then it connects to Hall of Fame Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=980.0)|
| 0:16:25| So that Broadway through the Fourth and Gill area and Old North Knot is not TDOT right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=985.0)|
| 0:16:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=990.0)|
| 0:16:31| But, Mr. Welch, all of the areas you've got highlighted in the bold there that we're talking about, the exemption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=991.0)|
| 0:16:36| those are all TDOT controlled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=996.0)|
| 0:16:38| Those are, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=998.0)|
| 0:16:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=999.0)|
| 0:16:42| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1002.0)|
| 0:16:46| I'll just point out in looking at the map, a large portion of that Asheville Highway section is also zone commercial highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1006.0)|
| 0:16:54| Big chunks of it are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1014.0)|
| 0:16:56| It's a mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1016.0)|
| 0:16:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1017.0)|
| 0:16:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1018.0)|
| 0:17:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1021.0)|
| 0:17:02| Move on to the next section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1022.0)|
| 0:17:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1024.0)|
| 0:17:05| Thank you, Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1025.0)|
| 0:17:06| At this point, we'll go through some examples that are kind of representative of CG across these corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1026.0)|
| 0:17:13| and this is development that's taking place or already has taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1033.0)|
| 0:17:18| So the first one we'll start out with here is an example of where the property owner rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1038.0)|
| 0:17:25| This is on Kingston Pike right here where the red star is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1045.0)|
| 0:17:30| It's 8000, 8004 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1050.0)|
| 0:17:35| You can see now that this location would be excluded and fall within the excluded corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1055.0)|
| 0:17:41| but currently it is a Scooter's Coffee and a Take 5 oil change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1061.0)|
| 0:17:47| What we had here was the applicant requested a rezoning from CG3 back in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1067.0)|
| 0:17:55| Planning staff reported the applicant sought a rezone due to the restrictive setback requirements in the CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1075.0)|
| 0:18:02| The 2021 commission denied the request, and council approved it in February of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1082.0)|
| 0:18:11| So here this is along a major arterial that Jeff was referencing earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1091.0)|
| 0:18:16| It's a four-lane section of Kingston Pike with a center turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1096.0)|
| 0:18:20| We've got the Take 5 oil, Scooter's Coffee right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1100.0)|
| 0:18:23| It's just west of West Town Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1103.0)|
| 0:18:28| So the next one we'll look at is the star right down here on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1108.0)|
| 0:18:33| These are a couple examples of where the Bill 2 zones requirements were met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1113.0)|
| 0:18:38| This first one is at 4103 Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1118.0)|
| 0:18:42| This parcel is zone CG2, and it requires a Bill 2 zone of zero to 20 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1122.0)|
| 0:18:47| so the front of the building has to be within zero to 20 feet off of Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1127.0)|
| 0:18:54| and 50 percent of the front of that building has to be within that Bill 2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1134.0)|
| 0:18:58| So this is currently a fast-paced health, and they met the Bill 2 zone requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1138.0)|
| 0:19:04| You can see here this is from their site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1144.0)|
| 0:19:07| This red dashed line shows the Bill 2 line in reference to Chapman Highway and their property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1147.0)|
| 0:19:18| This, again, is a major arterial, this section of Chapman Highway, four-lane with a center turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1158.0)|
| 0:19:25| It's just south of Moody Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1165.0)|
| 0:19:32| And the next example is another one that met the requirement of the Bill 2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1172.0)|
| 0:19:39| This is the star here off of Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1179.0)|
| 0:19:41| This is 2520 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1181.0)|
| 0:19:44| This parcel is zone CG2, another Bill 2 zone requirement of zero to 20 feet off of Sutherland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1184.0)|
| 0:19:51| as well as a Bill 2 zone requirement on the corner side of Emmett Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1191.0)|
| 0:19:57| This is downtown dental, and they met the Bill 2 zone requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1197.0)|
| 0:20:02| This is located across from Young-Williams Animal Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1202.0)|
| 0:20:08| Here's their site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1208.0)|
| 0:20:10| You can see by the red dashed line, here's the Bill 2 zone off of Sutherland, this area right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1210.0)|
| 0:20:19| And so they located the front of their building within that Bill 2 zone requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1219.0)|
| 0:20:25| and here's the Bill 2 zone requirement off the corner side of Emmett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1225.0)|
| 0:20:29| And you can see they located the front of their building off of Emmett in that Bill 2 zone as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1229.0)|
| 0:20:37| Here's an image of it at the corner of Sutherland and Emmett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1237.0)|
| 0:20:41| You can see how it fronts along those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1241.0)|
| 0:20:44| This is a two-lane minor arterial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1244.0)|
| 0:20:50| The last example is a property that is currently seeking a variance to the Bill 2 zone requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1250.0)|
| 0:20:57| This one is at 2900 Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1257.0)|
| 0:21:01| It's at the corner of Broadway and Edgewood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1261.0)|
| 0:21:04| It's zone CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1264.0)|
| 0:21:06| It has a Bill 2 zone of 0 to 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1266.0)|
| 0:21:13| And this is a corner side that they're trying to vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1273.0)|
| 0:21:17| So 30% of this corner side from 0 to 10 feet of the building is supposed to be within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1277.0)|
| 0:21:23| And so they are requesting a variance and going to the Board of Zoning Appeals in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1283.0)|
| 0:21:29| And here is their site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1289.0)|
| 0:21:32| The red line shows the actual property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1292.0)|
| 0:21:37| I'm sorry, excuse me, the Bill 2 zone requirement in relation to where the building should be located based on the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1297.0)|
| 0:21:46| This measurement right here is 30 feet as far as where they're putting it in location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1306.0)|
| 0:21:52| and asking for the variance from that corner side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1312.0)|
| 0:21:57| Here's the building that will be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1317.0)|
| 0:22:00| And this is the property where it will be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1320.0)|
| 0:22:06| It's just north of Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1326.0)|
| 0:22:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1329.0)|
| 0:22:10| I had a question from Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1330.0)|
| 0:22:12| Well, I think you might have hit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1332.0)|
| 0:22:14| If there are variances, you just mentioned the last one at the Old First Tennessee building that it's in process for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1334.0)|
| 0:22:21| The ones like the downtown dental, as you're going through them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1341.0)|
| 0:22:24| do you have notes on whether they got any variances, the ones that you're going through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1344.0)|
| 0:22:29| Like Scooter's Coffee, 5-Minute Oil, did they get any variances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1349.0)|
| 0:22:35| From my recollection, I don't think they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1355.0)|
| 0:22:37| No, Scooter's Coffee, they got rezoned so that they would not need variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1357.0)|
| 0:22:43| Okay, that was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1363.0)|
| 0:22:44| The other two met the Bill 2 zone requirements, so the downtown dental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1364.0)|
| 0:22:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1373.0)|
| 0:22:56| If you'll bear with an engineer speaking planning, and I'll probably flub this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1376.0)|
| 0:23:02| we've come up with what we believe makes sense moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1382.0)|
| 0:23:07| I will tell you that shortly after Council directed us to get with planning and revisit this, we spent a fair amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1387.0)|
| 0:23:16| Chris Halley was involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1396.0)|
| 0:23:18| This is where the development site plans come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1398.0)|
| 0:23:24| We looked at places like downtown west, which has a significant area of the CG2, CG3 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1404.0)|
| 0:23:33| and as we discussed it, we realized that any solution was going to take a while to arrive at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1413.0)|
| 0:23:41| We talked about overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1421.0)|
| 0:23:42| We talked about new zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1422.0)|
| 0:23:45| We went through the whole laundry list, and it is going to take some extra effort to come up with that right answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1425.0)|
| 0:23:55| Quite frankly, we believe it's going to take a fair amount of public input and public input from you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1435.0)|
| 0:24:01| You all know your districts best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1441.0)|
| 0:24:04| We need your help in that arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1444.0)|
| 0:24:06| All said, the first step that the Planning Commission approved and recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1446.0)|
| 0:24:12| we believe that's the right first step to get us started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1452.0)|
| 0:24:16| And then this fall, we're coming up on the summer months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1456.0)|
| 0:24:22| Not everybody is going to be here, and we felt like it would be a disservice to dive into this in earnest during the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1462.0)|
| 0:24:29| So what we're talking about is revisiting CG2 and CG3 districts on a community-by-community basis beginning early fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1469.0)|
| 0:24:40| to see what solutions we can come up with for planning to take to its commission and bring before you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1480.0)|
| 0:24:49| The constraints are pretty simple, and that is these are state routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1489.0)|
| 0:24:55| And where you see the shaded areas, this is where engineering-speak may not be exactly planning-speak, so forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1495.0)|
| 0:25:03| I would respectfully offer that as we come into the core of our city, that is urban development, and that has worked well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1503.0)|
| 0:25:12| What we have in our zoning ordinance is working well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1512.0)|
| 0:25:16| It's where we have these transitions to what I would call suburban, what has been traditionally suburban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1516.0)|
| 0:25:24| that we're struggling with the pedestrian aspect of these zones being implemented in full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1524.0)|
| 0:25:31| That's why we're seeing variances. That's why we're seeing rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1531.0)|
| 0:25:35| And one of the things that we want to do is to address this in such a way to where we don't have a number of variances or a number of rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1535.0)|
| 0:25:45| We've mentioned TDOT, their access control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1545.0)|
| 0:25:48| The encouraging news is that TDOT is sensitive to the pedestrian efforts as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1548.0)|
| 0:25:55| We don't have to look much further than Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1555.0)|
| 0:25:58| The concept plans that TDOT has recently completed to see that they're broadening their vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1558.0)|
| 0:26:04| and that it's more than just moving cars back and forth down their highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1564.0)|
| 0:26:09| They're looking at multimodal, including bikes, including pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1569.0)|
| 0:26:13| A lot of words on my part to say that we believe it is appropriate for planning to re-recommend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1573.0)|
| 0:26:23| for lack of a better term, what they brought before you in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1583.0)|
| 0:26:27| with the understanding that this fall we begin to drill into each one of your communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1587.0)|
| 0:26:33| where this may be an issue and see what is the best solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1593.0)|
| 0:26:39| It may very well be that it's not a one-size-fits-all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1599.0)|
| 0:26:44| There was one other point I wanted to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1604.0)|
| 0:26:47| Actually, I want Mr. Ahrens to make regarding CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1607.0)|
| 0:26:50| This has to do with CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1610.0)|
| 0:26:52| We know that there has been significant discussion by council on design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1612.0)|
| 0:26:57| and I'm going to let Peter address that with your permission, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1617.0)|
| 0:27:02| Please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1622.0)|
| 0:27:06| Thank you, Harold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1626.0)|
| 0:27:11| I think the issue with the CG1, as I've understood it from council and neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1631.0)|
| 0:27:18| is we don't want bad design in our corridors, in our CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1638.0)|
| 0:27:24| We don't want to have buildings with blank walls that you drive by every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1644.0)|
| 0:27:32| I think it definitely warrants investigation to look into what sort of options are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1652.0)|
| 0:27:43| I personally hate to jump right into design guidelines because, as we discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1663.0)|
| 0:27:49| not every building is a pedestrian building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1669.0)|
| 0:27:53| You've got your drive-through coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1673.0)|
| 0:27:59| Sometimes design guidelines don't fit for everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1679.0)|
| 0:28:02| so I think that it is something that we need to look into where there are standards that need to be met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1682.0)|
| 0:28:08| but with enough flexibility that we're not shoving every round peg through a square hole or vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1688.0)|
| 0:28:19| And I appreciate you bringing that up because council has brought up the design standards in CG1 as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1699.0)|
| 0:28:26| and I think the reason is that we had been seeing several examples of requests for rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1706.0)|
| 0:28:34| because the development wouldn't be able to be brought up to the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1714.0)|
| 0:28:42| and given the size of it and I think all the challenges we talked about before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1722.0)|
| 0:28:47| And I understand the flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1727.0)|
| 0:28:49| In fact, I think the discussion tonight is primarily about flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1729.0)|
| 0:28:53| We're talking about having flexibility in areas that are not going to be pedestrian-oriented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1733.0)|
| 0:29:02| as Mr. Welch said, very soon, if ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1742.0)|
| 0:29:06| and then making sure that we enhance that pedestrian-friendly area more in Center City where we can have that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1746.0)|
| 0:29:17| I guess my fear with not having design standards at all in CG1 is once something goes up, it's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1757.0)|
| 0:29:26| and it's going to be there for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1766.0)|
| 0:29:29| So I would agree with Mr. Ahrens that there probably is some level of flexibility that we could provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1769.0)|
| 0:29:38| with also making sure there's some protections that, you know, anything goes is not going to be the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1778.0)|
| 0:29:49| Mr. Boxborough, that concludes our presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1789.0)|
| 0:29:52| That's the last slide, so we're open for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1792.0)|
| 0:29:56| Then I'm going to volley it their way because I know what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1796.0)|
| 0:29:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1798.0)|
| 0:29:59| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1799.0)|
| 0:30:00| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1800.0)|
| 0:30:01| I've got a handful of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1801.0)|
| 0:30:02| I guess whoever feels bravest can take it for the gang of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1802.0)|
| 0:30:06| Sorry, greatest gang of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1806.0)|
| 0:30:11| In the first slide of our presentation, there's a public stakeholder committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1811.0)|
| 0:30:17| Maybe blanking, but who is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1817.0)|
| 0:30:20| That was the stakeholder committee that advised the recode process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1820.0)|
| 0:30:25| and they met for about a year after the adoption of the new zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1825.0)|
| 0:30:30| so they continue to have discussions on certain issues related to the new code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1830.0)|
| 0:30:37| So that's they sort of sunset at about a year, if I'm not mistaken, about a year after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1837.0)|
| 0:30:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1843.0)|
| 0:30:44| Has there been any other public input outside of that committee or planning commission meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1844.0)|
| 0:30:53| Not that I'm aware of, Council Member Smith, not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1853.0)|
| 0:30:57| Then two or three more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1857.0)|
| 0:31:00| On your recommendations, I think you recommended we approve planning commission's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1860.0)|
| 0:31:05| and then go area by area for public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1865.0)|
| 0:31:12| Did I mishear that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1872.0)|
| 0:31:13| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1873.0)|
| 0:31:14| We believe that I believe it will have to go back to planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1874.0)|
| 0:31:18| and then be sent back to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1878.0)|
| 0:31:21| We believe areas that were highlighted on the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1881.0)|
| 0:31:24| those are reasonable limitations for some of these changes for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1884.0)|
| 0:31:32| And then we're talking just a very few months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1892.0)|
| 0:31:36| and then the public process that you mentioned, we would open the door to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1896.0)|
| 0:31:41| to see how we need to refine this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1901.0)|
| 0:31:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1903.0)|
| 0:31:45| It seemed like maybe I missed this, but it seemed like some of the examples that you gave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1905.0)|
| 0:31:50| which I thank you for doing that, were some that required rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1910.0)|
| 0:31:54| some that required variances, and some that worked according to the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1914.0)|
| 0:31:58| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1918.0)|
| 0:31:59| All of those options were in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1919.0)|
| 0:32:01| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1921.0)|
| 0:32:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1922.0)|
| 0:32:03| And how would you describe why some worked and some didn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1923.0)|
| 0:32:18| I'll jump in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1938.0)|
| 0:32:20| Those that met, like the, was that a medical clinic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1940.0)|
| 0:32:26| Yeah, fast pace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1946.0)|
| 0:32:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1947.0)|
| 0:32:28| Those are not strictly an auto-oriented business model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1948.0)|
| 0:32:33| versus auto-oriented take five or drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1953.0)|
| 0:32:38| So in conjunction to the zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1958.0)|
| 0:32:41| the actual business use in their business model comes into play a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1961.0)|
| 0:32:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1969.0)|
| 0:32:50| I think that's the predominant reason why there was the request for the rezonings and variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1970.0)|
| 0:32:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1977.0)|
| 0:32:58| That's super helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1978.0)|
| 0:32:59| And along those lines, we talked a little bit in the beginning about pedestrian safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1979.0)|
| 0:33:06| as the primary driver of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1986.0)|
| 0:33:08| but it seems like developing old properties is the thing that's not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1988.0)|
| 0:33:15| In other words, I don't hear people coming up to me and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1995.0)|
| 0:33:19| I sure can't walk as good on Chapman Highway because the building's 10 feet more back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1999.0)|
| 0:33:25| versus fast pace is up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2005.0)|
| 0:33:27| I don't hear people saying this would change or increase their likelihood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2007.0)|
| 0:33:34| to walk on the sidewalks on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2014.0)|
| 0:33:37| So just objectively, this seems like a development challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2017.0)|
| 0:33:43| more than it is a pedestrian safety outcry that we've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2023.0)|
| 0:33:49| I understand the connection between the two, obviously, but am I wrong in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2029.0)|
| 0:33:56| I'm not sure if you've not heard the outcry or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2036.0)|
| 0:33:59| but the closer you can have buildings or street trees, whatever, to a corridor, roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2039.0)|
| 0:34:09| it tends to slow traffic down and tends to make it more comfortable to walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2049.0)|
| 0:34:16| That is what you're trying to encourage in that respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2056.0)|
| 0:34:21| So that, again, was part of the purpose of CG2 and CG3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2061.0)|
| 0:34:26| put the buildings closer to the street front and have activity on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2066.0)|
| 0:34:30| or on the sidewalks versus 100 feet or 30 feet off the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2070.0)|
| 0:34:35| So in other words, in these highlighted parts of the corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2075.0)|
| 0:34:37| there would be less encouragement of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2077.0)|
| 0:34:39| Yes, because the built environment is already significant there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2079.0)|
| 0:34:42| with shopping centers and that and larger lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2082.0)|
| 0:34:45| And on the one on Chapman Highway that you have up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2085.0)|
| 0:34:50| that would not have happened if we would approve this removal or addition of Section C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2090.0)|
| 0:34:59| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2099.0)|
| 0:35:01| No, this would still be in the required Bill 2 zone area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2101.0)|
| 0:35:05| That star is located right there, so it's just outside of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2105.0)|
| 0:35:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2110.0)|
| 0:35:11| And last question, then I'll be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2111.0)|
| 0:35:14| What determines where the star is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2114.0)|
| 0:35:20| Well, the star is the location of that particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2120.0)|
| 0:35:23| Why did you start at Young High Pike and not another street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2123.0)|
| 0:35:28| We looked at the various land uses and the character of the corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2128.0)|
| 0:35:34| and had to make a judgment of where we felt it was best to begin it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2134.0)|
| 0:35:40| There was debate on the planning commission for Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2140.0)|
| 0:35:43| as well as Kingston Pike of where it should begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2143.0)|
| 0:35:46| Some folks wanted it a little bit further to the south on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2146.0)|
| 0:35:50| And then Kingston Pike, there was comments about extending it a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2150.0)|
| 0:35:54| all the way to North Shore Drive, but they pulled it back to Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2154.0)|
| 0:35:58| A block or two or 1,000 feet were sort of some of the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2158.0)|
| 0:36:02| Chapman Highway was, again, there was an interest on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2162.0)|
| 0:36:07| But in the end, this is what the commission did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2167.0)|
| 0:36:10| The commission did modify staff's recommendation a bit on Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2170.0)|
| 0:36:14| but they did not on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2174.0)|
| 0:36:16| Mr. Berry, let me clarify the question I just asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2176.0)|
| 0:36:19| Fast pace would not have been possible in the shaded area if we accept Section C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2179.0)|
| 0:36:25| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2185.0)|
| 0:36:29| The build to distance for fast pace would not be required if we accept this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2189.0)|
| 0:36:39| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2199.0)|
| 0:36:40| In the shaded area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2200.0)|
| 0:36:42| If it were past Moody, this would not be the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2202.0)|
| 0:36:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2205.0)|
| 0:36:46| If you're saying they could have set the building further back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2206.0)|
| 0:36:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2208.0)|
| 0:36:49| Yes, they would have been able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2209.0)|
| 0:36:50| Further south of Moody, outside of the current range?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2210.0)|
| 0:36:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2213.0)|
| 0:36:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2214.0)|
| 0:36:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2215.0)|
| 0:36:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2216.0)|
| 0:36:58| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2218.0)|
| 0:37:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2220.0)|
| 0:37:02| So, a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2222.0)|
| 0:37:06| Number one, Councilman Smith asked specifically about some of the examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2226.0)|
| 0:37:12| I will specifically say the downtown dental location is on Sutherland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2232.0)|
| 0:37:16| which is a very walkable two-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2236.0)|
| 0:37:20| I pass that every day on the way to work and the way leaving work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2240.0)|
| 0:37:26| I pass it twice a day, and that's a very walkable route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2246.0)|
| 0:37:32| And so it makes a lot of sense to have a building that addresses the road in that kind of area, or new buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2252.0)|
| 0:37:38| Are people walking to the dentist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2258.0)|
| 0:37:40| Maybe, maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2260.0)|
| 0:37:44| And then what I will say about walkability and the outcry, just to kind of comment on that, of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2264.0)|
| 0:37:51| just kind of, I know some people don't know my district as well as others, so we all know our own areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2271.0)|
| 0:37:57| but close your eyes and envision yourself in one of the neighborhoods off-Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2277.0)|
| 0:38:03| We are close-knit houses, 50-foot wide lots for the majority, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2283.0)|
| 0:38:10| So the other night I parked on Chicago at my friend's house, and we walked to La Piñata,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2290.0)|
| 0:38:16| a Mexican restaurant that addresses the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2296.0)|
| 0:38:19| So we walk on sidewalk, sidewalk, sidewalk, and we walk into La Piñata, and we dine, and we walk away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2299.0)|
| 0:38:25| We don't have to walk through a parking lot to get to the door of the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2305.0)|
| 0:38:32| But if I wanted to walk from her house, or my house even, to go to Kroger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2312.0)|
| 0:38:39| and actually that's a really great example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2319.0)|
| 0:38:42| Many of those neighbors, like Broadway Towers, is a community where a lot of people don't have cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2322.0)|
| 0:38:48| They have to walk across Broadway, and then they have to walk through a sea of parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2328.0)|
| 0:38:55| that are oriented towards cars with no sidewalks to go shop at the Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2335.0)|
| 0:39:00| And that kind of sucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2340.0)|
| 0:39:02| I mean, you have to play Frogger to leave with your groceries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2342.0)|
| 0:39:06| So that was what the zoning code changes were about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2346.0)|
| 0:39:09| was so that in areas and communities where you have dense housing and you could walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2349.0)|
| 0:39:14| that you can literally go into the building without having to go through a sea of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2354.0)|
| 0:39:20| So when we make these changes, I think we just have to think about the different pockets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2360.0)|
| 0:39:26| Okay, so Mr. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2366.0)|
| 0:39:29| So what we're looking at is we had a proposal, which is the Section C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2369.0)|
| 0:39:34| and somebody jump in and correct me when I get wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2374.0)|
| 0:39:40| We had something that came to council agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2380.0)|
| 0:39:43| We rejected it and said we wanted to talk about this some more, and we scheduled this workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2383.0)|
| 0:39:50| And now it's will you guys just approve this so we have a temp fix so we can come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2390.0)|
| 0:39:57| and fix it in the fall when it's not summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2397.0)|
| 0:39:59| Is that what I heard you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2399.0)|
| 0:40:02| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2402.0)|
| 0:40:03| Let me add one condition to that, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2403.0)|
| 0:40:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2405.0)|
| 0:40:06| Can you go to the map, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2406.0)|
| 0:40:12| I believe Planning Commission staff is to follow the recommendations that you saw on the last slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2412.0)|
| 0:40:19| Here's the opportunity that you have for each of your districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2419.0)|
| 0:40:25| The staff helped draw the limits on where these shaded areas are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2425.0)|
| 0:40:33| From today on, what goes to the Planning Commission, if you want to see that changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2433.0)|
| 0:40:41| you can put that request into staff and make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2441.0)|
| 0:40:45| Or if they didn't change anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2445.0)|
| 0:40:47| You're talking about where the shaded areas are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2447.0)|
| 0:40:49| Where the shaded areas, if you wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2449.0)|
| 0:40:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2451.0)|
| 0:40:52| Because this is being revisited by the Planning Commission in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2452.0)|
| 0:40:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2456.0)|
| 0:40:57| So if you wanted that line, I'll use the star on Chapman for just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2457.0)|
| 0:41:02| Councilman Smith, if you and your constituents believe that needs to be further south, pick another road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2462.0)|
| 0:41:11| then that can be presented that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2471.0)|
| 0:41:13| Or even if it doesn't come to you that way, this body has the right, I believe, Vice Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2473.0)|
| 0:41:21| and please correct me if I'm wrong, to make adjustments to those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2481.0)|
| 0:41:27| I think what you're saying, Mr. Cannon, is in implementing what planning is proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2487.0)|
| 0:41:37| we're acknowledging that there's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2497.0)|
| 0:41:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2500.0)|
| 0:41:41| Which I think all of you are telling us is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2501.0)|
| 0:41:45| And then the quick piece to this is the adoption of what was presented to us back in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2505.0)|
| 0:41:53| and that begins a discussion citywide and certainly in our districts about where this line should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2513.0)|
| 0:42:03| And so that's where we're looking for public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2523.0)|
| 0:42:05| Is that maybe a better, finer point on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2525.0)|
| 0:42:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2528.0)|
| 0:42:09| The only exception I was offering is that this will be a new matter going back to Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2529.0)|
| 0:42:15| and you have the chance to make some tweaks, if you will, if you feel that that should have been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2535.0)|
| 0:42:23| My time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2543.0)|
| 0:42:25| I'm going to turn it off and I'm going to turn it right back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2545.0)|
| 0:42:27| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2547.0)|
| 0:42:29| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2549.0)|
| 0:42:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2551.0)|
| 0:42:32| So, Mr. Cannon, I think you clarified what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2552.0)|
| 0:42:37| It sounds to me like at this point if any district reps or an at-large person disagrees with some of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2557.0)|
| 0:42:44| we, with where that exemption place starts, we could say to planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2564.0)|
| 0:42:51| we think the road ought to be a certain way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2571.0)|
| 0:42:54| Then that can be debated by the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2574.0)|
| 0:42:57| and then if they agree with the esteemed colleagues I have who know their district better probably than the Planning Commissioners do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2577.0)|
| 0:43:05| then if that's accepted, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2585.0)|
| 0:43:09| But I will say in all this discussion, because I sit in an at-large seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2589.0)|
| 0:43:14| I mean, there's a real tension here because there's some places that just aren't going to be walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2594.0)|
| 0:43:22| I mean, because they're not going to be walkable because we can't build sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2602.0)|
| 0:43:27| because we have I don't know how many billions of dollars of sidewalk projects ahead that actually are in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2607.0)|
| 0:43:37| So I think that is a real factor in how realistic we can take a look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2617.0)|
| 0:43:46| Somebody mentioned downtown west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2626.0)|
| 0:43:48| My office is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2628.0)|
| 0:43:50| I wouldn't walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2630.0)|
| 0:43:52| I mean, there are a few sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2632.0)|
| 0:43:53| I mean, I could take a dead run out of downtown west across downtown west boulevard to get to Ramirez and go to Target,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2633.0)|
| 0:44:03| and some people do, but that's about all you walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2643.0)|
| 0:44:07| You don't see people on Kingston Pike walking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2647.0)|
| 0:44:10| And I also think the other thing we have to be mindful of is with some of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2650.0)|
| 0:44:16| we will absolutely preclude certain types of businesses, and if that's our intent, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2656.0)|
| 0:44:23| But, I mean, what we heard is some variances were asked for because the type of business they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2663.0)|
| 0:44:30| could not function with the lot restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2670.0)|
| 0:44:36| So I think that's also a tough am I correct about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2676.0)|
| 0:44:42| that it would make it very difficult for some types of businesses to actually be in CG2 if there's no place that it can be an exemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2682.0)|
| 0:44:53| So if it's a drive-through coffee shop, maybe with the exemption it can go further down the road and be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2693.0)|
| 0:45:02| because it would be an exempt area as opposed to having to ask for variances in the non-exempt area with this recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2702.0)|
| 0:45:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2712.0)|
| 0:45:13| I mean, I don't have the magic answer, but I would recommend that my colleagues get their request for moving exemption areas in quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2713.0)|
| 0:45:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2726.0)|
| 0:45:27| And we did put in sidewalks near Bearden High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2727.0)|
| 0:45:31| So there are sidewalks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2731.0)|
| 0:45:33| I understand that, but people don't walk on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2733.0)|
| 0:45:36| I've seen students walking on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2736.0)|
| 0:45:38| I will, but I'm just being realistic that students may walk on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2738.0)|
| 0:45:42| but they're not people that live close enough to Kingston Pike by and large because housing isn't quite there closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2742.0)|
| 0:45:52| Yes, they're great for the students that are getting dropped off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2752.0)|
| 0:45:55| but that's not the majority of who is around there all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2755.0)|
| 0:45:59| and they still drive like bats out of you-know-what coming out of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2759.0)|
| 0:46:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2764.0)|
| 0:46:05| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2765.0)|
| 0:46:08| I was going to say, did we skip Council Member Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2768.0)|
| 0:46:11| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2771.0)|
| 0:46:12| I'm used to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2772.0)|
| 0:46:13| It's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2773.0)|
| 0:46:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2775.0)|
| 0:46:16| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2776.0)|
| 0:46:17| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2777.0)|
| 0:46:18| It's okay, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2778.0)|
| 0:46:19| We'll take turns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2779.0)|
| 0:46:20| I might have to talk again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2780.0)|
| 0:46:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2781.0)|
| 0:46:22| I'm going to talk about part of the issue is how we skin the cat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2782.0)|
| 0:46:27| I don't know if that's offensive or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2787.0)|
| 0:46:28| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2788.0)|
| 0:46:29| Maybe not being PC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2789.0)|
| 0:46:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2791.0)|
| 0:46:32| We all agree there's a problem, so good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2792.0)|
| 0:46:35| We're all on the same page there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2795.0)|
| 0:46:40| There's the where and the what or the how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2800.0)|
| 0:46:44| So we've got the conversation about the shaded areas of the parameters of what the exclusions are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2804.0)|
| 0:46:50| Then let's talk about this whole concept of exclusions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2810.0)|
| 0:46:53| because I think that's part of the reason we rejected this when it came to council in the first place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2813.0)|
| 0:46:59| because that's the part I'm not sure I'm sold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2819.0)|
| 0:47:02| We can go back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2822.0)|
| 0:47:04| I mean, I think I gave 75 amendments to recode for parcels in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2824.0)|
| 0:47:11| so I'm happy to go figure out what needs to be where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2831.0)|
| 0:47:14| I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2834.0)|
| 0:47:16| But working with my constituents, that was feedback from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2836.0)|
| 0:47:20| But the what or the how we address the problem that we all agree that we have is, I think, part of my hang-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2840.0)|
| 0:47:28| And so, you know, we're talking about in another previous workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2848.0)|
| 0:47:33| we had a conversation about making some changes to things like accessory dwelling unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2853.0)|
| 0:47:38| and basing those changes on not changing the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2858.0)|
| 0:47:42| And the reason that we're having to do that and some of the other conversations we're doing there is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2862.0)|
| 0:47:46| during recode at the 11th hour, the request was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2866.0)|
| 0:47:49| we need a different zone because we're trying to apply the same standards to neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2869.0)|
| 0:47:56| that don't have anything to do with any, you know, they don't look the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2876.0)|
| 0:47:59| One's a horse and another's a zebra, but we're trying to zone them exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2879.0)|
| 0:48:03| And that's what we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2883.0)|
| 0:48:05| We've got horses and zebras up and down these corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2885.0)|
| 0:48:08| but we're trying to give them all the same standards, the same build to, the same this, the same that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2888.0)|
| 0:48:13| And so now we're going to say, you look at the map and if you have whatever, speckles or spots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2893.0)|
| 0:48:20| because that's how you guys are going to do this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2900.0)|
| 0:48:22| On the map, it's going to be the places with speckles or spots or shading is going to be treated different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2902.0)|
| 0:48:27| than the other places, but they're all going to say CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2907.0)|
| 0:48:30| And so let me just go backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2910.0)|
| 0:48:32| You know, we used to have R1, R2, R1A, and that's where you develop other zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2912.0)|
| 0:48:39| So my question is going to go back to, is this the right way to skin the cat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2919.0)|
| 0:48:43| is by putting speckles or spots on certain places and saying they're both CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2923.0)|
| 0:48:48| These CG2s are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2928.0)|
| 0:48:50| These CG2s are different here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2930.0)|
| 0:48:52| I just feel like maybe that's not the right way to approach it, and I question that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2932.0)|
| 0:48:57| Maybe these areas need to have, you know, their CG4 or CG2A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2937.0)|
| 0:49:04| I just think it is, I don't know, confusing in a weird way to skin the cat, if that's okay to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2944.0)|
| 0:49:11| That was my issue, and I had this conversation with Amy Brooks a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2951.0)|
| 0:49:19| We agree, and that's the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2959.0)|
| 0:49:22| Mr. Cannon, you should stop agreeing with me all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2962.0)|
| 0:49:24| We might start to get along, and we'll make some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2964.0)|
| 0:49:27| I didn't think we weren't getting along, but anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2967.0)|
| 0:49:33| That's the reason for the second part of the recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2973.0)|
| 0:49:36| is that we have tried to look at this from a community basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2976.0)|
| 0:49:42| and those shaded areas, I'll call them the outlier areas on those state routes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2982.0)|
| 0:49:47| seem to be reasonable demarcations for these variances, for lack of a better term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2987.0)|
| 0:49:57| to be considered, to be applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2997.0)|
| 0:50:01| Wherever that line needs to be, you're right, and I think I said that in the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3001.0)|
| 0:50:05| You know your districts best, and that's where Jeff needs input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3005.0)|
| 0:50:11| We believe this is the right first step, with this second step following,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3011.0)|
| 0:50:16| to come up with the right way to skin the cat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3016.0)|
| 0:50:20| and as we debated it amongst ourselves, it became real clear there's a number of ways to tackle this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3020.0)|
| 0:50:27| and we think that needs your input, we think that needs some public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3027.0)|
| 0:50:32| So we're heading exactly where you're proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3032.0)|
| 0:50:37| but also taking into consideration these outlier areas to give them the flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3037.0)|
| 0:50:43| to basically be consistent with what's happening in that pocket of that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3043.0)|
| 0:50:50| Okay, so are you saying you agree that we shouldn't have a bunch of things called CG2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3050.0)|
| 0:50:55| but they're not all CG2, we're going to have a CG2A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3055.0)|
| 0:51:00| I'm saying we need more discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3060.0)|
| 0:51:03| We've had discussion on overlay, we've had discussion on exactly what you said, CG2A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3063.0)|
| 0:51:10| What's the right way to do this so that it's easy for the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3070.0)|
| 0:51:15| and for someone who's wanting to buy that lot and develop it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3075.0)|
| 0:51:19| we want to make it as simple as possible to where they don't have to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3079.0)|
| 0:51:22| a bunch of different overlays or things like that, and is it a CG2A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3082.0)|
| 0:51:28| Maybe. It may very well be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3088.0)|
| 0:51:31| You can call it whatever you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3091.0)|
| 0:51:33| I just like the idea of calling it something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3093.0)|
| 0:51:35| Yeah, whatever it needs to be called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3095.0)|
| 0:51:37| and I think that needs to be part of our discussion in this second round, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3097.0)|
| 0:51:40| Okay, well, okay, I just want to be clear that that's part of why I rejected it the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3100.0)|
| 0:51:45| and I see Mr. Welch shaking his head yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3105.0)|
| 0:51:47| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3107.0)|
| 0:51:49| We're trying to address something that can be addressed relatively quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3109.0)|
| 0:51:54| We were hoping to address problems that were out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3114.0)|
| 0:51:57| without having to open up a can of rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3117.0)|
| 0:52:02| and, well, if you're going to touch this, why don't we touch this zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3122.0)|
| 0:52:05| If you're going to open it like that, then you have a trickle-down effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3125.0)|
| 0:52:08| or a waterfall, basically, where you look at all the different zones again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3128.0)|
| 0:52:14| Just kind of going along those lines, it sounded to me like what you're trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3134.0)|
| 0:52:21| is find a line where there's pedestrian area, you know, that's closer to the city center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3141.0)|
| 0:52:29| and there's more vehicular area further away from the city by where you're center city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3149.0)|
| 0:52:34| where you're drawing the bold lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3154.0)|
| 0:52:38| And maybe you're going to try that piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3158.0)|
| 0:52:43| and then look at maybe some kind of pedestrian commercial district overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3163.0)|
| 0:52:49| that you could use later on, which would be in similar areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3169.0)|
| 0:52:53| Is that kind of a good follow-up to what Councilmember Ryder is saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3173.0)|
| 0:52:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3177.0)|
| 0:52:59| I apologize, Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3179.0)|
| 0:53:02| I will call on you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3182.0)|
| 0:53:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3184.0)|
| 0:53:08| This may be obvious to some, but why not use CH in some of these areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3188.0)|
| 0:53:21| I mean, another easy solution, I won't say easy solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3201.0)|
| 0:53:26| a property owner has the right to ask for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3206.0)|
| 0:53:30| They have the right to come in and say, I don't like CG2, I want CH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3210.0)|
| 0:53:35| It is out there for any property owner to come in or developer to come in and ask for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3215.0)|
| 0:53:39| So we're trying to make it address a certain problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3219.0)|
| 0:53:44| but rezoning a piece of property is the right of anyone there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3224.0)|
| 0:53:47| So that is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3227.0)|
| 0:53:49| But is there any certain aspect of CH that wouldn't be good for this scenario?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3229.0)|
| 0:53:55| I'll have to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3235.0)|
| 0:53:56| I'm sure there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3236.0)|
| 0:53:57| Yeah, I'm sure there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3237.0)|
| 0:53:58| There's a lot of things that are in CH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3238.0)|
| 0:54:00| Design standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3240.0)|
| 0:54:01| Yeah, design standards or outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3241.0)|
| 0:54:03| I'm not sure, Mike, what's things that are just not attractive for CH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3243.0)|
| 0:54:09| So there are design standards in CH2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3249.0)|
| 0:54:13| So there's a level of that that would be applicable even if they're rezoned to CH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3253.0)|
| 0:54:18| The purpose statement for CH, going back to kind of what the vision is for that district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3258.0)|
| 0:54:26| is intended to accommodate higher intensity commercial uses of a predominantly auto-oriented character,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3266.0)|
| 0:54:31| including retail, rental, service establishments of a more intensive commercial character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3271.0)|
| 0:54:36| It's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3276.0)|
| 0:54:40| I don't presume to know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3280.0)|
| 0:54:42| I'm just asking folks that are smarter than I am at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3282.0)|
| 0:54:46| So the second thing I think is really important is the public input part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3286.0)|
| 0:54:52| I will take you up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3292.0)|
| 0:54:55| I think the amount of hours that went into recode for not just design standards or zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3295.0)|
| 0:55:01| but also for use were years worth of public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3301.0)|
| 0:55:07| And I think it's really important that we provide space for that outside of our typical meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3307.0)|
| 0:55:14| where everybody can come hear those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3314.0)|
| 0:55:16| And the last thing I'll say is I really appreciate the macro level view you're taking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3316.0)|
| 0:55:22| Nobody, including you all, want to be dealing with variances and spot zoning and that type of ad hoc decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3322.0)|
| 0:55:31| And I think it's unhealthy for communities to be forced with those kind of spot treatments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3331.0)|
| 0:55:37| So cheers to you all for taking a holistic use or a holistic view on zoning, use, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3337.0)|
| 0:55:45| without making one-off decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3345.0)|
| 0:55:48| So thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3348.0)|
| 0:55:51| Mr. Berry, I just want to follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3351.0)|
| 0:55:54| Are there different uses in CH and CG?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3354.0)|
| 0:55:57| Because all the CGs are the same use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3357.0)|
| 0:55:59| Would there be different uses in CH?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3359.0)|
| 0:56:04| Yes, there would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3364.0)|
| 0:56:06| You're going to get more intense uses in CH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3366.0)|
| 0:56:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3369.0)|
| 0:56:10| So that may not be what we're looking for here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3370.0)|
| 0:56:14| I guess that's an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3374.0)|
| 0:56:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3376.0)|
| 0:56:17| I'll call on Councilmember Pugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3377.0)|
| 0:56:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3380.0)|
| 0:56:21| Just a comment or a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3381.0)|
| 0:56:26| It seems to me that a big part of this problem is, correct me if I'm wrong, I didn't live through recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3386.0)|
| 0:56:33| I just watched it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3393.0)|
| 0:56:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3395.0)|
| 0:56:38| But it seems like a lot of this is a desire for pedestrian-friendly on a road that was never designed to be pedestrian-friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3398.0)|
| 0:56:50| because it is a state highway, and TDOT's job is to move traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3410.0)|
| 0:56:58| And the city residents would like pedestrian-friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3418.0)|
| 0:57:03| I guess I'm stating the obvious, but I also think when we talk to the community as we think about how we redo this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3423.0)|
| 0:57:11| do we really need to make that very clear that some of this may not be within our purview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3431.0)|
| 0:57:20| to make everything people want pedestrian-friendly as pedestrian-friendly as they would like it to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3440.0)|
| 0:57:27| Does that make any sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3447.0)|
| 0:57:29| Because, I mean, like, I'd like for people to be able to walk everywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3449.0)|
| 0:57:34| but if you have to deal with TDOT and that's not what they designed the road for, how much success will we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3454.0)|
| 0:57:43| which is what I think you're trying to get to with these shaded areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3463.0)|
| 0:57:49| But I will just say, with no dog in the fight, to use another animal analogy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3469.0)|
| 0:57:57| I think perhaps a separate name for whatever this is would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3477.0)|
| 0:58:10| I guess the question I have is if we don't make this change, what's the likely result?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3490.0)|
| 0:58:19| Are you going to see in the shaded areas, are you going to see more requests for rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3499.0)|
| 0:58:26| Are you going to see more variance requests?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3506.0)|
| 0:58:29| Are you going to see folks who don't get those want to reinvest in their properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3509.0)|
| 0:58:34| What are we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3514.0)|
| 0:58:39| More rezoning and variance requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3519.0)|
| 0:58:46| The impact here is not on the existing buildings that are already constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3526.0)|
| 0:58:50| As you know, they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3530.0)|
| 0:58:53| It's just for the vacant lots and those like the one that Brian showed that's going to BZA next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3533.0)|
| 0:59:01| where they're raising the existing building and building back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3541.0)|
| 0:59:06| And that applicant is pretty auto-centric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3546.0)|
| 0:59:11| We're seeing a real push for more drive-throughs, which I think has an impact on what their request is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3551.0)|
| 0:59:22| It puts a strange burden on the applicants to BZA because they have to show a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3562.0)|
| 0:59:33| It's tough when it's essentially a greenfield to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3573.0)|
| 0:59:40| I can tell you, Councilwoman Ryder, that the building code comes into play as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3580.0)|
| 0:59:46| I understand your concern about walking through the large parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3586.0)|
| 0:59:52| I welcome you to take a look at the car wash and the boot barn on the corner of Walker Springs and Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3592.0)|
| 1:00:01| The car wash has a pedestrian path from the sidewalk to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3601.0)|
| 1:00:06| And that's required by building code, and it's for accessibility purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3606.0)|
| 1:00:10| But I think that'll get to your concern of walking through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3610.0)|
| 1:00:14| International building code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3614.0)|
| 1:00:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3616.0)|
| 1:00:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3617.0)|
| 1:00:18| That's not a local decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3618.0)|
| 1:00:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3619.0)|
| 1:00:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3620.0)|
| 1:00:21| Just confirming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3621.0)|
| 1:00:22| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3622.0)|
| 1:00:23| So I think there's a lot of ways to get to this ideal of pedestrian-friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3623.0)|
| 1:00:30| We've got our zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3630.0)|
| 1:00:32| We've got the building code, which doesn't come at it from pedestrian-friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3632.0)|
| 1:00:39| but comes at it from treating people equally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3639.0)|
| 1:00:43| And if able-bodied people can walk there, albeit through a parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3643.0)|
| 1:00:49| we need to provide an accessible route as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3649.0)|
| 1:00:52| And you can see it on Google Maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3652.0)|
| 1:00:57| They're delineated, so even those in automobiles are aware that this is a pedestrian walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3657.0)|
| 1:01:04| So I thought I would throw that in there for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3664.0)|
| 1:01:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3669.0)|
| 1:01:12| I guess I'll turn it over to Mr. Cannon for some closing remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3672.0)|
| 1:01:17| But I guess the summary of what I've heard in the workshop today is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3677.0)|
| 1:01:23| that we have identified a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3683.0)|
| 1:01:26| and the discussion tonight is about what the solutions are that will encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3686.0)|
| 1:01:32| mixed-use and pedestrian commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3692.0)|
| 1:01:37| And the recommendation we're receiving is that there are some areas that are compatible with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3697.0)|
| 1:01:45| and there are other areas that are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3705.0)|
| 1:01:47| And you need our assistance in figuring out where those areas are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3707.0)|
| 1:01:52| And obviously my colleagues will put on their lights if they don't think that's a correct summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3712.0)|
| 1:01:58| But does that sound like what you're hearing as well, so you can take that feedback back with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3718.0)|
| 1:02:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3724.0)|
| 1:02:06| Following up from tonight, some of what you ‑‑ she has a light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3726.0)|
| 1:02:10| Let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3730.0)|
| 1:02:11| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3731.0)|
| 1:02:12| You go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3732.0)|
| 1:02:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3733.0)|
| 1:02:14| I just had a thought question that may not be related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3734.0)|
| 1:02:16| Well, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3736.0)|
| 1:02:17| Oh, just 441 is the TDOT, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3737.0)|
| 1:02:22| TDOT manages ‑‑ I'm sorry, you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3742.0)|
| 1:02:25| I'm in my own wheelhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3745.0)|
| 1:02:27| Broadway is Highway 441, and that's TDOT managed, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3747.0)|
| 1:02:32| Except for somebody said it switches over to Hall of Fame to Henley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3752.0)|
| 1:02:37| and then does it pick up for the Henley Street Bridge to Chapman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3757.0)|
| 1:02:45| Yeah, there's like two different highways there where 441 hits Hall of Fame Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3765.0)|
| 1:02:52| and then Neyland Drive and around, so yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3772.0)|
| 1:02:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3777.0)|
| 1:02:58| So I'm just trying to frame this in my mind in a bigger thing based on a couple of comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3778.0)|
| 1:03:01| so bear with me here for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3781.0)|
| 1:03:03| So then 441 goes down Chapman Highway to Seymour and exits Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3783.0)|
| 1:03:08| That's still TDOT, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3788.0)|
| 1:03:10| About 441.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3790.0)|
| 1:03:12| And then it goes all the way down to Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3792.0)|
| 1:03:16| And then you go up into the Smoky Mountains National Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3796.0)|
| 1:03:19| That's still 441, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3799.0)|
| 1:03:21| And that's TDOT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3801.0)|
| 1:03:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3803.0)|
| 1:03:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3804.0)|
| 1:03:25| And just for people, for food for thought, bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3805.0)|
| 1:03:27| Bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3807.0)|
| 1:03:28| I'm connecting the dots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3808.0)|
| 1:03:30| Gatlinburg, which I avoid, to be honest, that whole area is very pedestrian, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3810.0)|
| 1:03:38| A million Americans, I don't know, millions of Americans are within driving distance to vacation there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3818.0)|
| 1:03:44| and they all can walk on those sidewalks, and that's 441 right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3824.0)|
| 1:03:48| Or does it take the bypass at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3828.0)|
| 1:03:50| That I don't recall which one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3830.0)|
| 1:03:52| It may take the spur around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3832.0)|
| 1:03:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3834.0)|
| 1:03:55| I might find the answer out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3835.0)|
| 1:03:56| Anyway, I'm tying my thoughts together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3836.0)|
| 1:03:58| Okay, I'll be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3838.0)|
| 1:03:59| I just wanted to ask some experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3839.0)|
| 1:04:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3841.0)|
| 1:04:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3842.0)|
| 1:04:03| I'll let you close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3843.0)|
| 1:04:07| First is thank you all for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3847.0)|
| 1:04:09| We greatly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3849.0)|
| 1:04:12| We heard you after the November council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3852.0)|
| 1:04:16| We dove into this, and we realized that this is a deeper subject that a mere tweak could handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3856.0)|
| 1:04:27| Just the discussion tonight on options, you see what we were facing as far as doing our best to arrive at the right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3867.0)|
| 1:04:34| at the best answer we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3874.0)|
| 1:04:38| And to Councilman Smith's point, arriving at that answer we do believe warrants more public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3878.0)|
| 1:04:45| What we propose to do after tonight, unless there's a strong, strong objection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3885.0)|
| 1:04:51| is ask the Planning Commission to revisit this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3891.0)|
| 1:04:57| In all probability, I expect the same recommendation will come back to council subject to input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3897.0)|
| 1:05:05| I would ask if you could help us get the input to planning as promptly as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3905.0)|
| 1:05:11| as far as the delineation of these excluded corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3911.0)|
| 1:05:17| We believe that's the right first step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3917.0)|
| 1:05:19| and we would support planning taking that step with the condition that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3919.0)|
| 1:05:27| we all need to revisit this beginning in the fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3927.0)|
| 1:05:31| and have that public input to work towards an answer that makes the most sense for all these communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3931.0)|
| 1:05:37| So thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3937.0)|
| 1:05:39| And the only thing I'd add to that is with some flexible design standards in CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3939.0)|
| 1:05:45| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3945.0)|
| 1:05:47| We really appreciate you spending the time with us this evening and on this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3947.0)|
