| 0:04:28| UT Knoxville's team won the top honors this couple weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=268)|
| 0:04:34| A member of that team was Joan Monica, who just happens to be Madeline O'Hara's stepdaughter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| so congratulations to Joan and to the UT team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| I would like to recognize several folks from our public service team who are here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| You might remember about two months ago we recognized someone who passed the GED| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| in a program that was started out through public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| We started that in the fall of 2008 with about 20 participants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=295)|
| 0:04:59| and since that time four of them have received their GEDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| The graduation ceremony is May 21st at Central United Methodist at 6 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=302)|
| 0:05:08| May 21st at Central United Methodist at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| And a couple of those folks are here, and I'd like to ask them either to stand or to wave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| David, I think they're here with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| Dwayne Cole and Amanda Bonas, did I say that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| They both work in horticulture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| They're here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| Enzo, I'm going to say their last name wrong, so help me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=326)|
| 0:05:36| Montenote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| Is that close?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=339)|

| 0:05:43| So we want to congratulate you all and thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| We're proud of you in making the extra effort to get your GED| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| and really excited for your future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| Thank you, and thank you for coming to be with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=351)|
| 0:06:01| On Thursday, May 7th, MERGE, which is the graphic design firm helping us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| with the downtown wayfinding project, will present three possible plans they have developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=365)|
| 0:06:11| That's Thursday, May 7th at 630 in the small assembly room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| and we'll give everybody a chance to view the different options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| for the downtown wayfinding project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| This is sounding like a little bit of a repeat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| but I want to welcome the folks from the Knoxville Ice Fairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| If they'll move their way down toward the podium real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| Their general manager, Mike Murray, and the coach, Scott Hillman, are here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| They won the President's Cup for the second time, I guess, back-to-back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=393)|
| 0:06:40| Defending a chance for the Southern Professional Hockey League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| They won the trophy back in mid-April, and they became the first team ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| I think, in Southern Professional Hockey League to ever win back-to-back championships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| Unless I'm wrong, I think we talked about this the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| This is three out of the last four championships that they've won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| They also won the coffee trophy for the regular season championship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| I think I've had my facts right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| Coach, you were down 3-2 in the championship series and came back to win two in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| On behalf of the city of Knoxville, congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| We're very proud of you and your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=430)|
| 0:07:18| Mike or Scott, if you'd like to say a few words, that'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| You don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| Just real quick, obviously we couldn't do this by ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| It took a lot of fan support and a lot of support from a lot of areas to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=447)|
| 0:07:33| Obviously our coach, this is only his second year in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| I'm sure he's made a big impact on our organization and in our city overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| It was a sure pleasure to represent Knoxville across our jerseys all season long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=461)|
| 0:07:48| going into other towns and beating them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| and bringing the Cubs actually not just one but both Cubs back to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| So we're very pleased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| Those other folks here that work with us, with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| are Bob Polk and Dale Dunn over there with the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| That's our home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| A lot of people don't like coming into our home because they tend to lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| I'd like to pass it over to Scotty real quick because he's done an outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| Only his second year in coaching, and he's got four trophies to attest to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=493)|
| 0:08:20| Coach, again, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| Thanks for allowing us to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| It's a true honor, and this certainly doesn't get old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| So if we can have your permission, we'd like to make a date to be here again next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| Back-to-back-to-back sounds great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=513)|
| 0:08:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| If you remember, two weeks ago we tried to recognize some firefighters who did some heroic work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=520)|
| 0:08:46| and unfortunately I think we had some miscommunication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| But this one is worth repeating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| I want to remind you of the story for those who weren't here and those who were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| and it's a story worth hearing again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| Back a month or so ago, firefighters were dispatched to a familiar location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| 3724 Skyline Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| Engine Company 6 had responded to many calls there in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| most of those being medical in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| Actually, all of them being medical in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| But on this particular morning, it was not a medical call that brought them back to the address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| There was a fire, and there were two elderly people trapped inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| Charles Vandergriff and his wife Sue, of more than 40 years' marriage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| lay sleeping in a back bedroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| not knowing that their only means of egress was growing dimmer every second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| In the kitchen area between their bedroom and the front door, there was a fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| filling the air with a dark black choking smoke creeping closer and closer to the Vandergriffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| Sissy Mudda, a Knoxville News Sentinel paper carrier working her paper route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| noticed smoke coming from the house and called 911| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| after several unsuccessful attempts to stir the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| Firefighters Sean Bradley and David Gray made their way past the flames| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| to the back room where the two victims lie, nearing unconsciousness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| and pulled Charles and Sue to safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| I would now like to present certificates of recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| I'll come down there, if you'll make your way to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| to Sissy Mudda, Sean Bradley, and David Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=599)|
| 0:10:17| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| And, Sissy, thank you for taking proactive action that obviously was lifesaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| We very much appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| On behalf of the city of Knox, we'd like to present that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| And, David, we'll make sure I got the right one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| David, thank you and Sean for reacting so quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| We're proud of all of you and we're grateful for all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| Thank you for making the effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=636)|
| 0:10:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| I think we can move on to reports of counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=653)|
| 0:10:56| Mr. Ross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| Memorial Day is Honor Fountain City Day, Fountain City Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| It'll really be going on starting at about 12 noon, but at 4 o'clock at Fountain City Lake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=661)|
| 0:11:10| there's a memorial service, which is led by Congressman Duncan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| and then there'll be a brief program at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| I'd like to encourage members of the public and council to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| Vice Mayor Bob Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| Two announcements about upcoming council events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| One is Thursday, May 14th, we'll be having a workshop on convenience voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=689)|
| 0:11:37| sort of understanding this potential new pilot project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| It'll be 5 o'clock, either in this room or that room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| Folks in the public who care about the voting process are welcome to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=703)|
| 0:11:49| and let us know what they think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| I also want to let folks know that we have budget hearings coming up on May 20th and June 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=711)|
| 0:11:58| We should have an agenda, a draft agenda done tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| Putting it together reminds me of how incredibly good a job Vice Mayor Brown did as Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=722)|
| 0:12:09| This is a lot more complexity to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| So hopefully you all have that on your calendar, and we'll see you at those council workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=732)|
| 0:12:18| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| I'd like to call on Mr. Hill this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| He and I had a conversation earlier today regarding the coverage in today's paper about CityView at Riverwalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| and the city's involvement with a TIF on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| I really don't have a whole lot to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| I did send an e-mail out to all the council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| Councilman Booker, I need to update my address list and make sure that you get a copy of the e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| I apologize for that oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| On May 1st, there was a lawsuit filed by Regions Bank against the three holding companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=771)|
| 0:12:58| that constitute the partnership for the CityView project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| It's the Glove Factory Land Holdings, Blunt Avenue Marina Investors, and then CityView at Riverwalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=782)|
| 0:13:10| And basically the problem is that they have not been able to finish the improvements on the private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=790)|
| 0:13:20| There is an amount of $23 million in the loan that is in default according to the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=800)|
| 0:13:28| And what I tried to indicate in the e-mail is that although the city does not have any financial participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=808)|
| 0:13:39| in the private part of the project, we do have a $2.8 million project-specific TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=819)|
| 0:13:47| We used that money, $1 million of that $2.8 million, for land purchases for the Riverwalk 60 feet of shoreline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=827)|
| 0:13:56| as well as the right-of-way needed for some street improvements for the side streets and for Blunt Avenue itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=836)|
| 0:14:03| Of that $2.8 million, the $1 million was for land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=843)|
| 0:14:09| Another $1 million has already been spent or reimbursed to Focus Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=849)|
| 0:14:16| which is the general contractor, for improvements primarily to the side streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=856)|
| 0:14:23| and to the bank stabilization and grading for the Riverwalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| All of those reimbursements have been made after the work has been completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| and inspected by our city engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| So I think we're in good stead in terms of reimbursing for improvements that have already been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=875)|
| 0:14:41| and done according to the plans and specifications that were approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| So there's $800,000 left in the TIF account, and for the time being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| we have notified through a notice of default to Focus Development or CityView at Riverwalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=892)|
| 0:15:02| because they failed to pay a subcontractor that we were not going to disperse any more funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| So we have, in effect, between KCDC and city staff, frozen or not really frozen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=908)|
| 0:15:17| but we have decided that we will not honor any more reimbursement requests from that fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| until we figure out how the improvements will be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| And a clarification I want to make that was not in the e-mail is that the actual loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=926)|
| 0:15:35| is between the three entities, actually, the regions named in the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=935)|
| 0:15:41| They're all private entities and BB&T Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| The only role that the city or KCDC play is that they actually manage the fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| so that they make sure that any improvements are inspected and approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=952)|
| 0:15:59| and then we also check the reimbursement requests before we will authorize BB&T| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=959)|
| 0:16:06| to wire the money over to Focus Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| So that's the only role we play in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| We have no financial obligation or risk with respect to those funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=972)|
| 0:16:19| so I think that we're being very prudent with taxpayers' dollars in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| The other thing that we did is because you never know exactly what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=984)|
| 0:16:30| There can be unanticipated costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| We followed the lead, really, of our city engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| and also required under a development agreement that Focus Development name as a beneficiary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=997)|
| 0:16:45| for an irrevocable letter of credit to the city in the amount of $1.115 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1005)|
| 0:16:53| So beyond the $800,000 that is in that BB&T account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1013)|
| 0:16:59| we can also call in on that letter of credit if we find that $800,000 is not enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| to finish the side streets and the Riverwalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| And again, that letter of credit is the responsibility of CityView at Riverwalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1029)|
| 0:17:19| There is no public entity liable for the repayment to that Georgia bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| that issued the irrevocable letter of credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| In short, what I think we're trying to tell you is even though the project may be in trouble financially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1048)|
| 0:17:36| I would estimate that the condominiums themselves are at an 80% to 85% completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1056)|
| 0:17:42| The side streets are nearly 90% complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| I would estimate that the Riverwalk itself is at a 60% to 70% completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1066)|
| 0:17:54| So I think that we've protected our interests very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| We have enough resources to make sure that the project will be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| but we will be relying on KCDC and their legal counsel to kind of guide us the next week or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1082)|
| 0:18:10| just to make sure we're following procedurally and financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1090)|
| 0:18:16| We follow and pursue the options that protect our interests the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| And it's in everybody's interest really to make sure the project is done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| and we get those condos occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| So I'll answer your questions if you have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| I have just one follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| When you say that you feel confident that the City has the resources to see the project to completion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| obviously you mean the public improvements project, not the condominium development itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| Our only involvement, and yes, the clarification is we have no involvement in the private side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| That's between Regions Bank and the three partners in the condominium project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1123)|
| 0:18:52| Our role and our financial risk is limited only to the public improvements that will be wholly owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1132)|
| 0:19:01| and operated by the City of Knoxville by the time we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| And you said the Riverwalk or Greenway is 70% to 75% complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| Do you have an idea when it might be open for use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| If we could continue working on it without having to worry about focus perhaps leaving the premises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1153)|
| 0:19:22| and having to publicly bid it, I'm not really sure what the procedure will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| But I think we were within probably a month or two of having that segment of Riverwalk completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| Until this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| A couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| You mentioned there's an irrevocable letter of credit with, was it CityView at Riverwalk, one of the three entities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1180)|
| 0:19:47| If we have an entity going into financial straits, if not foreclosure and bankruptcy, how will that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1187)|
| 0:19:56| I mean, it's not a completion bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| No, it's not a completion bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| It is a letter of credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| And my feeling is, until somebody tells me otherwise, that the bank is going to have to honor that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| should the city decide to call that letter of credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| And then collection on that letter of credit is going to be the business of the bank in Georgia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1213)|
| 0:20:19| and a focused development, which I think went personally on the line, on the hook for that letter of credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1219)|
| 0:20:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| And this might not be for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| It might be for Dr. Lyons or Law Director Poplin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| In this case and other cases where there is a pilot or a TIF involved, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| what are the ramifications to the city if you have someone go into foreclosure and or bankruptcy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1239)|
| 0:20:47| I think I'll let Dr. Lyons answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| There really are none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| That is, if taxes are not produced, their loan is not serviced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| So the city is not obligated in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| We have nothing at risk in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| Now, if, okay, say it goes into foreclosure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| and some other developer purchases it on the courthouse steps, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| what's going to be the mechanism for determining whether or not we're going to go forward with the pilot or TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1269)|
| 0:21:16| Is that going to have to come back to council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| Or when somebody is buying on the courthouse steps, are they buying the rights to a TIF or a pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1279)|
| 0:21:26| I might defer on this after I give what I think is the right answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| which is the TIF does transfer without its coming back to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| That, in fact, did happen on the building down on 100 Block of Gay Street, the Century, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1295)|
| 0:21:43| Not the Century, I'm sorry, the Commerce Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| And the ownership did change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| The TIF did stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| That was part of it, and that project was continued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| I just want to make one clarification, if I may, Mayor, and I think it's an important one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| Because of the fact that we are investing only in public improvements in the South Waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| we're not going to run into that difficulty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| because whenever we are going to be looking at some kind of a private agreement with a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| to complete public improvements, it's really going to be the subdivision model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| where we require some surety beyond whatever might be financed through the TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| in order to make sure that we have the performance bond in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1342)|
| 0:22:28| It's almost like what engineering requires all the time for subdivision improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| Any other reports from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| Councilman Woodhull, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| The Knox County Public Library has a series called Brown Bag Green Book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| and next Thursday I will be delivering a book report on the green collar economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1367)|

| 0:24:07| I'd like to recognize Rick Held, who is a teacher at Austin East, and he has about six of his students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1447)|
| 0:24:17| They're actually not here as a class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| They all chose to be here because they care about this learning more about the issue of green jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1459)|
| 0:24:28| and getting more information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| and they frankly also wanted to be here to applaud you, Mayor Haslam, for signing the green manifesto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1471)|
| 0:24:41| or whatever it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| What did you sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| Don't put it under manifesto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| Manifesto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| You are a green mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| Rick, could you come up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| Hey, Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| Thank you for having us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| We started out with six folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| Right now we've at least doubled that number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| and luckily for them they won't get counted tardy tonight, so we're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1509)|
| 0:25:15| I'm actually here with my name is Rick Held,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| and I teach a class in U.S. government at Austin East High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| and also a class in economics at Austin East High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| I'm with these young folks who are going to graduate in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| It's gone by pretty quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| and I'm very proud of these folks for all that they've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| and how they've performed over what seems like so long ago, last August now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| But in two weeks they will graduate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| and when they do graduate, as we all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| they're going to enter one of the most uncertain job markets in history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1552)|
| 0:25:59| And so what my students are here for tonight is to ask their city government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1559)|
| 0:26:07| to help them and the Austin East community become part of the green economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1567)|
| 0:26:14| Over the last few weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| our classes have been studying the potential local impact of the economic stimulus package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1576)|
| 0:26:23| that was passed by Congress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| and we've also had valuable help from Beth Eason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| who, as you all know, is on the city's Energy and Sustainability Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| She took a couple hours of her time out to come and talk to our classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| and basically get us up to speed on the great things that Knoxville has already got in the works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1600)|
| 0:26:46| to make our city and our economy stronger and cleaner and more sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1606)|
| 0:26:53| So I want to make sure we thank Beth tonight for visiting our classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| and getting us up to speed on the greening of the Knoxville economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| Especially we learned from Beth about the exciting possibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| for environmentally friendly, sustainable, quality green-collar jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1626)|
| 0:27:12| And we learned from Beth also that the mayor, Mayor Haslam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| recently signed through the U.S. Conference of Mayors the Green Jobs Pledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1638)|
| 0:27:24| which basically, in short, it's a pledge to make sure that the jobs we need the most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| that is green jobs in this economy, go to those that need them the most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| which includes folks not just in the Austinese community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| but in other communities who are struggling particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| and have been struggling a lot longer than some of the folks who are just now starting to feel the impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| of the economy that we're dealing with today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| So we want to applaud the mayor for signing this Green Jobs Pledge, for starters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1672)|
| 0:27:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| We have a visual over here if they'll ever hold it up, the thank you poster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| It's upside down. There you go. Turn it the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| Thank you, Mayor Haslam, for green jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| The other one's upside down. Turn it around. There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| So thank you for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| So I have a few students here tonight who I'm very proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1701)|
| 0:28:28| And if you'll permit us, I'd like for a few of them to make some brief comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| about what this new green economy and green jobs means to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| And please warmly welcome them to their very first city council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1719)|
| 0:28:46| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| We'll start with Regineek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1730)|
| 0:29:01| Hello. My name is Regineek Denton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| Green collar jobs can affect me personally because it can make me a better citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| not just in Knoxville, but also in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| I will learn how to live in a more efficient neighborhood and be more active in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1753)|
| 0:29:21| It also leaves a good feeling that we're living a decent life for our next generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1761)|
| 0:29:27| Green collar jobs can affect the Austinese community by getting people to work to better their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| I think it will cause the community to become closer to one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| Green collar jobs will not only prevent pollution and make a healthier city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| it will also promote a better lifestyle and create a place where even those with troubled lives can escape to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1781)|
| 0:29:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| Please welcome Amadou Soiré.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1794)|
| 0:30:05| Hi. My name is Amadou.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| And nine weeks ago I was like trying to major in engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| and I was going to major in mechanical engineering until I got to Mr. Health's class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| And he kind of teach me about green collar jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| So I found it interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| So I was like, I'm going to major now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| I'm going to change my major from mechanical engineering to solar engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| So I was like, I want to know a lot more about this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| And he was like, OK, you should go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| That's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| He probably gave me the energy to move forward with that major.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1838)|
| 0:30:45| Because I went to my family, I talked about it, and they didn't like it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| because they wanted me to become in mechanical engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| The way that it can affect communities, like they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1855)|
| 0:31:01| you have to have a diploma or something like that to get a green collar job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1861)|
| 0:31:08| Most of the people in our community didn't graduate from college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| They didn't go to college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| So if they say you have to have like a diploma from high school or college to go to this job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1873)|
| 0:31:20| it would really affect the community because most of those people need a job to help their family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1886)|

| 0:31:54| Hi, my name is Dana Littlejohn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| I have been living in Knoxville my whole life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| I have seen my community change in a good and bad way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| This project can help me and my family and other families in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| I think this can better the economy and also help the earth as we better the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1928)|
| 0:32:16| Thank you, Mayor Haslam, for signing the green collar jobs bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| But I just want to kind of just go over what my life has been like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| I got in some trouble while I passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| And I think if we would have had these jobs, I might not have gotten to that trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| But I'm not trying to make no excuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| I did do what people know me as, and I did do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| And I want to apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| This is the first time I have came out and said this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| But I just want to thank you for signing this bill and please help our community out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| Thanks, Dana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1969)|
| 0:32:56| Ms. Kear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1976)|
| 0:33:09| Hey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| My suggestion for the City Council of Knoxville is for them to provide paying green jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1990)|
| 0:33:16| not only for adults but for teenagers interested and willing to help the environment like myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=1996)|
| 0:33:24| Because I'd rather be contributing to a greener society than bagging someone's groceries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| or flipping burgers throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2012)|
| 0:33:38| Last and certainly not least, Paris Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2018)|
| 0:33:46| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2026)|
| 0:33:55| I'm Paris Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| About two years ago, I had moved here to Knoxville from Detroit, Michigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| And, like, it's been a big change from the hills, you know, compared to the big city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2041)|
| 0:34:08| But what I realized is, you know, this city here has a lot of chances for people compared to where I used to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2048)|
| 0:34:15| I believe that the green-collar jobs will actually bring more to the city as well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| because there's still a lot of stuff that goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| But there's so much more that can, you know, become positive out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| So, with that being said, I think the green-collar jobs should be a good thing to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2068)|
| 0:34:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| To Mr. Held and to these several members of the Austinese class of 2009, congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| We appreciate you coming and having the courage to speak and for being a part of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| We're grateful for all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| Oh, we have one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| Come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| We're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| I'll read off my paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| With the subject at hand, green-collar jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| I think that the city as a whole would be best to start creating jobs now while we have the funding coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| with the stimulus package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| It will make the environment cleaner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| I say this because catalytic converters have been mandatory for every car in the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2115)|
| 0:35:27| to reduce air toxins into the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| And this has gone from just one state requirement of California to all 50 states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2130)|
| 0:35:37| And I was wondering when is this going to pass to be required for the city rivers, lakes, streams, gutters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2137)|
| 0:35:44| fields, parking lots, and air and water quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| It's just a matter of when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| And when this does happen, there will be a mad rush to create jobs in need of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2151)|
| 0:36:00| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| By starting now, we can already be having our feet wet in the jobs we won't be just now taking it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2162)|
| 0:36:11| and turn Knoxville into one of the best places for people with asthmatic to live instead of one of the worst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2171)|
| 0:36:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| Thank you, Mr. Hale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| Thank you all for coming in, and we congratulate you on your graduation in just 11 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| Way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2192)|
| 0:36:39| Having heard all that testimony, you ready to vote on that resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| 11B is a resolution urging the legislature of the state of Tennessee to decline to adopt a number of proposed bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| which would threaten the quality of water in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| Requested by Council Member Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| I'm going to make a motion to approve, but I think Renee Hoyos is here from the Clean Water Network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2223)|
| 0:37:11| We're going to try to amend this so that the language is more appropriate to where things stand now in the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| Renee, if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| Renee, if you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| My name is Renee Hoyos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| I'm the Executive Director of the Tennessee Clean Water Network, and I live at 327 East Quincy Avenue in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2241)|
| 0:37:28| Thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| Again, I apologize for not being here at the last council meeting session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| I did send out an email to all the council members with a request that we amend this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| to take out the bill numbers that are listed because these bills change quite rapidly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| So I would hate to have the council be saying that these bills, these particular bill numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2265)|
| 0:37:51| shouldn't pass if they turn into something good, which actually did happen at the end of session last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2271)|
| 0:37:57| But the rest of it is fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| Any second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| Oh, yeah, there's a second from Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| Any Mr. Holquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| I want to make a motion now to amend Section 1 to remove references to all specific bills, the A through I bills that are listed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2286)|
| 0:38:16| Senate and House bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| There's a motion and a second to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| Related language, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| Any other discussion on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| Now we're back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| Are there any comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| Mr. Batley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| Mayor, I don't know about the other council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| I personally hadn't had a chance to really research and analyze these bills and or discuss it with our delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2324)|
| 0:38:56| and I really don't feel comfortable passing something along like this without really knowing the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2336)|
| 0:39:03| So I probably will not support it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| Just in response to your comment, Mr. Batley, I felt the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| I was concerned about the specifics of these bills and met with Ms. Oyas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| and feel comfortable that by deleting the specific bills it's generic enough for me to endorse that it really just says we're in support of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2358)|
| 0:39:27| clean water initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| I agree there might be specifics in certain bills that are not in the best interest of our constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2369)|
| 0:39:38| but, again, in meeting with Ms. Oyas, I felt like this was generic enough that I was comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2378)|
| 0:39:45| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| I think my comments would be that I concur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| and I think that what actually this gives us an opportunity to do is to recommend to our legislative body in the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2389)|
| 0:40:02| to seriously consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| I think taking out the specific references makes me much more comfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| because I certainly am not familiar enough to make those decisions or to be wanting to make a recommendation even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2409)|
| 0:40:16| But I do believe that letting them know that we as city council members are very interested in these bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2416)|
| 0:40:24| and hope that they will be in contact with us if they need to know more about our thoughts on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2424)|
| 0:40:31| and perhaps have a workshop or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| But I think, too, that this becomes generic enough that it's just simply a recommendation that they study this carefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2433)|
| 0:40:41| and be very considerate before they make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| Further clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| The amendment takes out the language at the end of the long sentence in Section 1 where it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2448)|
| 0:40:54| and in furtherance of this policy to defeat the following proposed legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2454)|
| 0:41:00| after the word state there should be a period and in the language beyond that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| the remainder of Section 1 has been deleted by the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| Councilman Bailey, if you or anybody else, I realize you haven't had a chance to fully review it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| but if you see any other language that you think is of concern that's not generic or general enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| I'd certainly like to know about it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| But I concur with Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| I believe that it's general enough to be acceptable, in my eyes at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| So I will, of course, support this and sponsor it as it's amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| This question is for Mr. Kang.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| Is the Department of Engineering or anyone from policy development within the city in touch with our state delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2499)|
| 0:41:47| regarding how any of these bills might hinder or assist our compliance with our NPDES permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2507)|
| 0:41:56| I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| Yes, we are in regular contact with Tony Thompson and Jane Alvis, the Big Four lobbyists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| and also receiving, as these bills change, reaction back from TML.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| But as these come, we share that with Mr. Kang and Brent and recommend, you know, as they advise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2528)|
| 0:42:16| and has been consistent with these bills as we see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| Because I would guess that some of these bills might assist in our compliance with that permit, depending on how they turn out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2547)|

| 0:42:50| So I think I'll support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2570)|

| 0:44:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| Quick question for Director Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| This is for an indefinite period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| This is adjustments to an interlocal agreement that we have with TML.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2680)|
| 0:44:47| And Gary is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| I'll ask Gary about the time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| I just saw it sound like an indefinite period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| so I was wondering if there would ever be some benefit in the future while we might want to drop out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2696)|
| 0:45:03| I think this is interlocal agreement that allows you to do certain things with the TML,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| and then each of those – well, go ahead, Gary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| This is not a contract to purchase the insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| This is just to join the interlocal agreement that gives us the ability to purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| And then each of those would come before council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| Any other questions for Gary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| Anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2726)|

| 0:45:30| 12A is an ordinance making and fixing the annual appropriations for the several departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2730)|

| 0:45:42| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| Yeah, I'd like to make a motion which I think will fit to approve this on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| and postpone it until the June 2nd meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| Does that – Mr. Swanson, is that a proper motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2750)|
| 0:45:56| Technically, you probably should approve it on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| and then ask the administration not to bring it back by a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| Like he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| So the motion is to approve this on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| The administration, we won't bring this back until the June 2nd meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2770)|
| 0:46:17| And so noted on that from the administration's behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| Any other questions or comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| Mr. Becker, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| For folks watching, there's an interesting dance always with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| By charter, on first reading, we are only allowed to pass the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| So we have our budget discussions coming up down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| So it's not like we just pass the budget without even thinking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| And the reason for the delay is so we can have the hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| which have already been announced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| Some smart mayor in the past set up to where you could only vote yes on the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2809)|
| 0:46:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2816)|

| 0:46:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2819)|

| 0:47:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2849)|

| 0:47:35| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| Let me make one quick comment just for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| Vice Mayor Becker always says everybody watching at home, everybody here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| The actual tax rate for next year won't be set until the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| Knox County property appraiser certifies the appraised value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| on everything that's reappraised in this four-year cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| That rate gets certified, sent to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| We send it to the state and they certify it and then come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| In simple math, the way it works is if the appraiser says overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2879)|
| 0:48:04| all the property as a whole in the city has gone up 15%, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2884)|
| 0:48:10| then the tax rate itself will go down 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| So we will approve a rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| but that rate will change once your next property tax bill comes into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2895)|
| 0:48:20| So hopefully that was clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| 12C is an ordinance to amend Sections 2-450, 458,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=2902)|

| 0:53:38| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| I want to take a moment and just contextualize this request within the context of the charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3219)|
| 0:53:46| that the City of Knoxville has given the 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| As you're well aware, the charge you've given us is simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| The charge is simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| The task is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| It's end chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| And the primary operating strategy that we're using to do this is a nationally proven strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3238)|
| 0:54:04| called Housing First, which simply defined can be described as the housing of chronically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3244)|
| 0:54:11| homeless individuals in permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| As you've heard me say in the past, we'll need to bring hundreds of new permanent supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| housing units online to accomplish the goal of ending chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3259)|
| 0:54:25| A Southeastern Housing Foundation's proposed project represents 48 units of permanent supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3265)|
| 0:54:32| housing that we desperately need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| David, in his comments, was too humble to announce to you that as of today, he successfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3275)|
| 0:54:42| anchored this proposed project with two significant funding sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| First, he has acquired a million-dollar grant from the Federal Home Loan Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3286)|
| 0:54:52| And secondly, today, the Tennessee Housing Development Agency announced that Flinigan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| Housing LP was the only applicant for the permanent supportive housing set aside in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| this year's 9% competitive tax credit application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| This means that this project, which Southeastern Housing Foundation is contemplating, has no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3307)|
| 0:55:13| competition for $5 million of tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3313)|
| 0:55:17| This, as you might imagine, represents a significant funding source for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3317)|
| 0:55:24| In conclusion, your vote to rezone this parcel to O1 is significant for several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3324)|
| 0:55:29| First, it's congruent with the action that MPC took in its April meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| Secondly, it's in line with the downzoning that the community has previously petitioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3334)|
| 0:55:38| for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| Thirdly, it's in line with an important precedent that was established on the adjacent property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3339)|
| 0:55:45| that Mr. Arning spoke about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| And finally, most importantly to me, it represents one more significant step forward in coupling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3347)|
| 0:55:54| significant funding with a worthwhile project so the Office of the Ten-Year Plan to End| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| Chronic Homelessness can successfully fulfill the charge that you have given us, the charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3359)|
| 0:56:05| of ending chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| I also am here to answer questions if you may have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3371)|
| 0:56:12| Vice Mayor, is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| Yeah, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| Mr. Lal, I want to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| I know this is a rezoning, but obviously the Ten-Year Plan is a piece of this, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3377)|
| 0:56:24| is why you're up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| And you talked a little bit about the significant fundraising that's happening to build this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| And I want to ask a good question that I'm hearing from a lot of residents about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3390)|
| 0:56:35| long-term sustainability of something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| And can you just talk to a minute to talk about what other steps we're taking, not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3398)|
| 0:56:44| to raise money to build this, but to make sure that down the road we can operate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| effectively, we can be providing the services that this is going to need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3412)|
| 0:56:53| It's something we wrestle with day in and day out, as you're well aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3413)|
| 0:56:59| Sustaining permanent supportive housing takes really two major initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| First, you have to have an operating plan for the property itself based upon acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| rents that allows the property to cash flow and pay its bills and stay in service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| Secondly, you have to have a funding source for the most critical services necessary for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| the success of the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| That's the case management services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| As of today, there are no federal, state, or local funds solely dedicated for case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3443)|
| 0:57:29| However, we have an organization in town, which is the Ten-Year Plan's, it's their designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3449)|
| 0:57:35| agency function to provide case management services, and that's Volunteer Ministry Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3455)|
| 0:57:41| That's the entity that will be contracted with to provide these services on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| It's an entity that has a long and well-established history, and it's an entity that has shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3465)|
| 0:57:50| itself able to raise money to provide the services it's been charged to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3470)|
| 0:57:57| We'll work diligently with them to acquire grants, but really, they have the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| and they will grow their capacity to raise the funds, to hire the case managers, to effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3481)|
| 0:58:09| provide case management services at this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3489)|
| 0:58:15| Mr. Hall, what similarities is there between this proposed project and MN Villa?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3495)|
| 0:58:23| They are identical projects except for the number of units contemplated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| MN Villa will be a combination of one bedroom and a fishing unit totaling 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| This project will be 48 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| The type of project it is is identical, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| It's permanent supportive housing, which is, again, the perfect product to serve the chronically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| homeless population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| I guess when it comes to funding from the city, I know MN Villa, which I think all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3525)|
| 0:58:52| us supported originally, which was before you, I think, you know, had one price tag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3532)|
| 0:58:59| and then it just seems like it just keeps growing and growing and growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| As far as cost, do you have any kind of projections as to what kind of cost that the city is liable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3544)|
| 0:59:10| to anticipate with this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3550)|
| 0:59:14| To answer your question, fortunately, MN Villa will not continue to grow in its cost because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| we have a guaranteed maximum price and so we're happy about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| But secondly, on this project, there are only rough estimates of what it will cost simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3561)|
| 0:59:27| because construction drawings have not been generated and, therefore, a good guaranteed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| maximum price has not been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| However, the acquisition of this 9%, the successful application for these 9% tax credits is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3574)|
| 0:59:44| Traditionally, these kind of tax credits can provide anywhere from 60 to 65% depending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| on the pricing of the project cost, whereas MN Villa use 4% and they're a lot less lucrative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3589)|
| 0:59:57| So with the million-dollar grant plus these 9% tax credits, Southeast Housing Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| is way down the road in successfully funding this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| Ms. Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| Mr. Lawler, one of the things that Vice Mayor Becker alluded to was concern about the long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3607)|
| 1:00:15| viability of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| And I guess the question I want to ask, I know for a community, once a building is built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| or renovated, it can be there for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| What is the commitment to use this property for permanent supportive housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| How many years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3631)|
| 1:00:32| And then I have a follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3632)|
| 1:00:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| I'll let Mr. Arning answer that because using the tax credits, you commit to a specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| duration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| But since he's the applicant, I'll let him answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| The short answer is 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| In 15 years, if our chronic homelessness problem has been reduced to the point that this structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3647)|
| 1:00:55| no longer needs to be used for that use, or if for some reason we decide to change where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3655)|
| 1:01:01| we're doing permanent supportive housing, explain to me how the renovations to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3661)|
| 1:01:07| former school would be any different from renovating it as individual apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| In other words, could it be converted to a regular apartment for rent use in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3672)|
| 1:01:19| Or are the renovations so specific that it really locks that structure into this use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3679)|
| 1:01:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| They could very easily be used for market rate rental units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| I think the distinction between what we're contemplating is slightly smaller units than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3688)|
| 1:01:33| you might construct, but not to the point that they wouldn't be attractive to, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3693)|
| 1:01:40| a younger professional or graduate student type clientele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| Mr. Alquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| Yeah, Mr. Arning, what is the anticipated square footage per unit that you're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3707)|
| 1:01:56| about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| Because that really does raise the question whether or not it's going to be marketable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| to the general market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| I don't think I have that information with me, but I would guess in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| of an average, I think an average for the efficiency units was maybe around 400, 450| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3727)|
| 1:02:16| square feet and a one-bedroom 500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| But I can get you that information based on very rough schematics of laying out a floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3740)|
| 1:02:27| plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| With the set-aside, I don't know how THDA handles the set-aside for chronic supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| housing for chronic homeless population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3754)|
| 1:02:41| You say that it can be converted if the demand is not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| Are there stipulations on the set-aside that say it has to be used for that purpose for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| 15 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3771)|
| 1:02:52| Only during the tax credit compliance period, which effectively ends up being 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3772)|
| 1:02:58| So essentially, not full 30 years, but for 15 years, it cannot be converted, is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3778)|
| 1:03:05| you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3785)|
| 1:03:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3786)|
| 1:03:07| It has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3787)|
| 1:03:08| And so what happens if there isn't a demand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3788)|
| 1:03:13| The units just sit, some of the units would be empty at that point, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3793)|
| 1:03:19| They would be, or the tax credits, the investor would be exposed that those tax credits could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| be recaptured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3805)|
| 1:03:26| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3807)|
| 1:03:28| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| John, one of my concerns, and I'm sure some of the folks in the audience, some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3809)|
| 1:03:37| surrounding neighbors have, are with the potential new residents and some of the safety concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3817)|
| 1:03:43| And, you know, what do you say in terms of, speak to the agreements and the contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3823)|
| 1:03:49| and the, with the residents that will be in the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3829)|
| 1:03:54| I know you've spoken to us before about sort of the oversight and the agreements, and could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| you speak to those neighbors and help them calm some of their concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| Well, you know, I probably could talk until I'm blue in the face about this one, but really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3843)|
| 1:04:10| the answer is the experience we already have in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| For instance, VMC has operated units on the 100 block at Gay Street, and no one ever hears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3854)|
| 1:04:19| any complaints about those residents and the negative effect or positive effect they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3859)|
| 1:04:25| may be having on that 100 block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| The truth is, they live there successfully, independently, and have stayed in housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3867)|
| 1:04:34| and have succeeded there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| There are other permanent supportive housing developments, one in the Magnolia area that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3876)|
| 1:04:41| most of us don't even know about, and again, because it houses 20 plus individuals and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3881)|
| 1:04:48| they live there successfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| So again and again, we are having more and more experience in Knoxville with this type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| of housing, but a lot of times there is fear associated with housing these individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3894)|
| 1:04:59| because by definition they're disabled individuals, and a lot of times that disability is associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3899)|
| 1:05:04| with their mental illness, and that creates some fear that we think is not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3904)|
| 1:05:10| What about the agreements and the contracts and so forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| Yeah, I mean, these individuals have a lease and they pay rent, like all of us if we went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3913)|
| 1:05:19| to rent an apartment somewhere, some other form of dwelling, then each, the manager will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3919)|
| 1:05:28| determine the terms of the lease, and when those terms are violated, then that individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| no longer enjoys the privilege of living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| So this would be unlike any other apartment unit you would rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3936)|
| 1:05:42| The terms of the lease terms are about the protecting that living environment and making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| a high quality environment for all that live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| What about folks within your program that live there and sort of the oversight and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3949)|
| 1:05:55| little bit more protection there, security that you wouldn't otherwise have in other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| parts of the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| Yeah, again, it's not, it wouldn't be right for me to speak to the actual programming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3961)|
| 1:06:08| associated with the support piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| Volunteer Ministry could speak to that, and I didn't know we'd go get into that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| They'd be ready and able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| But again, the goal here is, and what VMC has shown in there, the units they operate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3978)|
| 1:06:26| you're creating a quality living environment for those that are there and providing services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| to meet the individual needs of the residents to help them succeed in housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3990)|
| 1:06:35| But the goal is not just help them succeed in housing, but to be good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| So they're not only interested in the quality of life there, but how they contribute to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| the neighborhood that surrounds them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| Well, I'm sure if you were sitting in our seat up here, you wouldn't want to put anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| in next to your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| You wouldn't want to put anything next to their house that you wouldn't put next to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4011)|
| 1:06:54| your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4014)|
| 1:06:55| And that's sort of the way I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4015)|
| 1:06:56| And I'm comfortable with, from what I've heard, and we've heard a lot from you on how these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| folks are dealt with and how they interact with people in the program that, in my view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4022)|
| 1:07:10| have oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4030)|
| 1:07:11| And I'm comfortable with it, but I just wanted for others in the surrounding area to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4031)|
| 1:07:17| some of what I've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| And I hope, if they have any other questions, that they could talk to the folks at Volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4039)|
| 1:07:24| Ministry or you or whomever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| I should say that our office is in dialogue with not just South Knoxville Neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4047)|
| 1:07:33| we're talking about here, but all neighborhood groups about what it looks like to successfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| operate permanent supportive housing with an eye towards being a good neighbor to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| neighborhood, but neighbors serving as good neighbors to the residents of permanent supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| So that dialogue is important, because if we're going to solve this problem, it's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| to have to be a mutually beneficial relationship between the development and the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4071)|
| 1:07:56| And we understand that and are committed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| Can I follow up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4081)|
| 1:08:02| Councilman Frost is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4082)|
| 1:08:03| It's actually a follow-up to what he just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| Can you just, John, just amplify what you just said about the ongoing dialogue and mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4085)|
| 1:08:09| what's happening tomorrow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4089)|
| 1:08:10| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| I appreciate you bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| Tomorrow evening at 6 o'clock at the Public Defender's Office, which is off of Liberty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| we'll have our second discussion with neighborhood groups and other representatives from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4097)|
| 1:08:22| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| I don't know if you were there at our last one, where we began a series of conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4103)|
| 1:08:29| about how can we so design permanent supportive housing so as to be something that is an asset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4109)|
| 1:08:38| in communities, and how can communities interface with permanent supportive housing so as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| help it succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| And we began that discussion, and we see it as an ongoing discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| We'll kind of close the loop on one topic we addressed at the last meeting, and hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4127)|
| 1:08:54| we'll close that tomorrow night, but then we'll begin to entertain other topics the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| group wants to talk about, and we'll address those on an ongoing basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| So communication is key on something like this because, again, chronic homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4141)|
| 1:09:07| is a problem that affects our community, and so we as a community need to solve that problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| and we need to be dialoguing about how to do that in a way that's mutually beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| And we're committed to that in the Tenure Plan Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4158)|
| 1:09:19| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| This is for Mr. Arnie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| The tax credit issue, you talked about 15 years and you were locked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4163)|
| 1:09:27| Is there not a pro rata recapture of that if it's terminated early that you could do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4167)|
| 1:09:33| So it could be less than 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| Some money would have to be given back though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| The tax credit investor would forfeit the tax credits they had purchased to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4178)|
| 1:09:43| the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| It would be a pretty ugly situation with the partnership and the ownership interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4186)|
| 1:09:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| But I mean, you're not necessarily locked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| I mean, do they get the tax credit all in year one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| No, they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4196)|
| 1:09:57| The low income credit is taken over 10 years evenly, and it has to be taken that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| However, the compliance period is the full 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4205)|
| 1:10:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| So even after they've claimed their credits, they're still at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4209)|
| 1:10:10| I think there was another gentleman who got up who wanted to speak maybe, and we'll ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4210)|

| 1:10:15| Please state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| My name is Joe Minichiello, 311 Lindy Drive, and I'm speaking for the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| And behind me will be Mr. Perkins from the Downtown South Knoxville Business Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4224)|
| 1:10:31| It's always tough to follow Mr. Lawler and Mr. Arnie, as I've learned from many meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4231)|
| 1:10:37| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4237)|
| 1:10:38| For Mr. Hickman's benefit, I'd like to say that everybody in the audience is in opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| to his plan for Flanagan School, since there aren't many of us here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4243)|
| 1:10:50| That's why we're wearing these Dayglo stickers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4250)|
| 1:10:56| Before I forget, we did submit a petition which contains almost 250 names as a new petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4256)|
| 1:11:03| The petition Mr. Arnie referenced was done almost a year ago with over 200 signatures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4263)|
| 1:11:10| but the request for 01 was with the understanding that we would be allowed to put restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4270)|
| 1:11:16| on it in terms of residential housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4276)|
| 1:11:20| That turned out to not be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| So we've gotten together a new petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| We have almost 250 signatures on it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| We dropped it off for the record here tonight, and we are still in the process of collecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4287)|
| 1:11:32| more signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| Mayor Haslam, Vice Mayor Becker, and the members of the City Council, thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| We are here as the South Knoxville community, and as you can see, everyone behind me who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4301)|
| 1:11:47| wearing the sticker from the Vestal Neighborhood and other South Knoxville organizations are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4307)|
| 1:11:52| here against the zoning change to rezone the Flanagan School project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4312)|
| 1:11:58| We would like to recommend that you return to MPC the recommendation that the Flanagan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4318)|
| 1:12:04| School site be downzoned to 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| If the MPC's intent were to rationalize the different zonings on the site, we suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4328)|
| 1:12:14| that they consider changing the 01 parcel to C3, and thus making the entire site C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4334)|
| 1:12:22| With this change, we will then have more time to try and develop a concept for the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4342)|
| 1:12:27| that we as a community will find acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| We do not find the current plan for development acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4350)|
| 1:12:35| The Vestal Neighborhood, as you can see from the photos we submitted to you, is diverse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4355)|
| 1:12:41| fragile, and we maintain at a tipping point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| If our neighborhood were a hospital patient, it would be judged to be in critical condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4365)|
| 1:12:51| but it is not yet on life support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| The residents and businesses battle crime, drug dealing, abandoned houses, and garbage-filled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4374)|
| 1:13:02| lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| The burden of another federally subsidized housing project, we feel, will push the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4383)|
| 1:13:10| past the point of no return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| Remember, our neighborhood is home to Montgomery Village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4392)|
| 1:13:17| Once a neighborhood fails, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, expensive, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4397)|
| 1:13:23| time-consuming to restore it to viability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| To quote from the South Sector Plan, quote, neighborhoods are the most basic, physical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4407)|
| 1:13:33| and social units of the city and region, unquote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4413)|
| 1:13:38| Another excerpt, we should protect neighborhoods from intrusive uses, declining public facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4418)|
| 1:13:44| and other blighting influences, unquote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| Continuing from the South Sector Plan, avoid concentration of halfway houses, boarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4428)|
| 1:13:54| houses, and publicly assisted rental housing in any given neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| Finally, from another paragraph in the South Sector Plan, ensure that the context of new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4440)|
| 1:14:06| development, including scale and compatibility, does not impact existing neighborhoods and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4446)|
| 1:14:14| communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| Give us a chance to try to bring a positive vision to Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4455)|

| 1:14:39| War attraction, and the Chapman Highway Corridor Plan all point to a renewed Vestal neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4479)|
| 1:14:49| If the developer's project is approved, it will have to stay as a subsidized income facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4489)|
| 1:14:56| for, they say, 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| My understanding was 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| Let us not create something now that we will look back on with remorse, sometimes in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4501)|
| 1:15:07| future, realizing that we have made a terrible mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4507)|
| 1:15:12| Please do not give up on Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| Its residents and business owners still believe in it as a living neighborhood, a place to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4515)|
| 1:15:21| buy a home, raise a family, to conduct a business, or to live out senior years in safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4521)|
| 1:15:29| We do not fool ourselves into thinking it will be easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4529)|
| 1:15:34| If with hard work and vision, we can create a year-round farmer's market on the Flennican| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4534)|
| 1:15:39| site or an artist co-op showcasing the work of local artists or any number of positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4539)|
| 1:15:46| projects, we feel we deserve that chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4546)|

| 1:16:34| a poor, ignored neighborhood, and that the odds are against us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4594)|
| 1:16:40| Recall what happened Saturday at the Kentucky Derby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4600)|

| 1:17:15| My name is Jeff Perkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| I represent this evening the Downtown South Business Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4636)|
| 1:17:22| Just a few things about the person who stands before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| I've worked with several non-for-profits in the past decade, bringing housing, education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4645)|
| 1:17:34| and business opportunities to folks in third-world countries, as well as areas that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4654)|
| 1:17:39| hit by natural disasters, such as this country, Central America, and South America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4659)|
| 1:17:45| I've worked for several years as a mentor with neo-Nazi kids in Eastern Germany, pulling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4665)|
| 1:17:50| them out of the grips of difficult circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4670)|
| 1:17:55| Currently, I'm a businessman in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4675)|
| 1:18:01| Every day, I see the effects of a struggling economy, of a struggling neighborhood, of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4681)|
| 1:18:08| struggling people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| There's much hope in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| The people are hardworking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4695)|
| 1:18:19| The people who live in these communities and who do business in these communities are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4699)|
| 1:18:23| mostly honest, hardworking, well-intentioned folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4703)|
| 1:18:28| We do have our struggles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| We do have our hiccups, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4711)|
| 1:18:35| The business community has gathered together in an effort to boost the economy in South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4715)|

| 1:18:49| South Knoxville, West Knoxville, North Knoxville, East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4729)|
| 1:18:54| One thing that I have in common with my clients is they hesitate to come to my place of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4734)|
| 1:19:02| because they're fearful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| My own children and wife will not come to my place of business after dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4745)|
| 1:19:12| It's an issue of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4752)|
| 1:19:18| The Downtown Business Association has several ideas for building the business atmosphere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4758)|

| 1:19:32| Knoxville amongst our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4772)|
| 1:19:37| We've been districted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| We've been divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| We've been castigated, but we are one Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4782)|
| 1:19:49| As a businessman in South Knoxville, I realize that the health of our businesses, the viability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4789)|
| 1:19:58| of our people will result in vibrant, healthy, growing communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4798)|
| 1:20:07| There is a limit along the Chapman Highway corridor of property that can be purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4807)|
| 1:20:16| and developed for commercial purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4816)|
| 1:20:21| The few properties that are there for commercial purposes are literally unpurchasable at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4821)|
| 1:20:27| point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4827)|

| 1:20:35| a wonderful opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| With its C3 zoning, we have the opportunity to bring businesses in that will spark the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4839)|
| 1:20:44| imagination, the development, the economic viability of South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4844)|
| 1:20:53| This is a position of hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| This is a position of opportunity for our city and for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4856)|
| 1:21:06| I am supportive of the efforts to end chronic homelessness in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4866)|
| 1:21:17| I financially support Knoxville area rescue missions, Goodwill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4877)|

| 1:21:40| I support the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| I've fed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| I've taken them to the hospital when they've had needs, but I recognize that this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4904)|
| 1:21:52| on the Flinigan property will not be beneficial to the businesses and the communities of South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4912)|
| 1:22:01| Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4921)|
| 1:22:02| Therefore, I request that the city council refer back to the MPC, the zoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| for the Flinigan school property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| The MPC needs to conduct a comprehensive study of the entire area for the proper future zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| There's not been a recent study done to determine the most suited zoning for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4936)|
| 1:22:20| The location of this old school property is crucial to the long range planning of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| portion of South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| It is strategically located between Maryville Pike and Martin Mill Pike, an auxiliary access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4945)|
| 1:22:30| route to the cities of Alcoa and Maryville, the airport and John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4950)|
| 1:22:34| Therefore, special consideration needs to be applied when zoning this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4954)|
| 1:22:39| Any and all applications and requests to rezone any part of this property to 01 should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| submit details to what type of office use they propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| This location would not be satisfactory to just all types of office use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4968)|
| 1:22:55| I understand the challenge that the MPC has and also the challenge that you have and your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4975)|
| 1:23:00| responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| We are all temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| However, the decisions that we make have a permanence that outlasts our abilities to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4985)|
| 1:23:12| make those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| Therefore, I recommend that we go forth with wisdom, considering the general population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=4994)|
| 1:23:22| and our businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5004)|
| 1:23:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5005)|
| 1:23:26| Questions or comments from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5006)|
| 1:23:31| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| I guess this question is for Mr. Arning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5013)|
| 1:23:38| One of the points that Mr. Minichiello referenced was some policy recommendations in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5018)|
| 1:23:45| strong neighborhoods and neighborhood preservation and that buildings should be compatible in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5025)|
| 1:23:51| scale and design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| I guess I've made some assumptions in my head about what this might look like, but we haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5033)|
| 1:23:57| seen any construction drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| What is the intent in terms of the exterior of the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| Will there be wings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| I drove around that property several times and was back in the parking lot, and you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| tell the building's been added onto over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| Would any portions of the building be removed and rebuilt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5052)|
| 1:24:17| Will there be parking added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| Will there be parts of the property paved to accommodate vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| I would assume that most of these residents would not have private vehicles, but that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| might not be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| That makes a difference to me because I don't have a picture in my head of what the final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| product will look like, surrounded as it is by various other zoning uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5071)|
| 1:24:37| That's a great question, and I'm sorry I glossed over that or didn't address it up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5077)|
| 1:24:42| The Flinnegan School was built in three stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5082)|
| 1:24:45| The oldest central part that you see from Flinnegan Avenue dates to 1919, then the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5085)|
| 1:24:51| wings were added in the 1920s, and then the addition you were referencing that's newer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| is from the 50s, and that housed a cafeteria that goes back towards, in the general direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5095)|
| 1:25:01| of Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| Our plan right now would be to remove that section that was added in the 50s and preserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5103)|
| 1:25:09| the 20s and 1919 original section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| We would have units, double-loaded corridor within the historic parts of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| and then we would add a one-story addition where the cafeteria is currently that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5118)|
| 1:25:24| house between eight and ten efficiency units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| It would be connected, and then we'd have a central entrance that actually for the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| would be in the back of the property, and there would be some parking, although we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| probably need to seek a parking variance because I don't think we're going to have enough land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| to develop the parking the code would require, and as you mentioned, we don't anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5141)|
| 1:25:45| that any of the residents will have cars, but the access would be, and forgive me, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5145)|
| 1:25:51| going to get my roads mixed up, but I believe it's Marable Pike, which is the northern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5151)|
| 1:25:57| boundary of Flinken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| There is a curb cut there already, and that would be the driveway access for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5159)|
| 1:26:05| So in terms of the operations and the tenants coming and going, it would be through actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5165)|
| 1:26:10| the back of the school as you think of it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| And are there any historic designations on the building already, and are there any restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| in terms of how you proceed since you'll be renovating the areas that date to 1919?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5178)|
| 1:26:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5184)|
| 1:26:25| Actually, there is no historic designation, either national or local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| We've had some preliminary talks with Knox Heritage about the eligibility of whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5189)|
| 1:26:34| or not it would qualify as historic and whether or not we might pursue historic tax credits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5194)|
| 1:26:40| but the consensus seems to be that too much of the building, particularly the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5200)|
| 1:26:44| windows have been removed and what they refer to as the historic integrity has been compromised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5204)|
| 1:26:50| So the short answer to that is no, there are no current historic overlays and nothing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5210)|
| 1:26:56| that respect that would govern the design of the building, although it would be our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5216)|
| 1:27:00| intention to essentially restore it as it originally looked from the exterior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5220)|
| 1:27:06| And in terms of the design of the building, what kind of security concerns will you address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5226)|
| 1:27:14| I guess primarily for the residents, that they would have a secure place to live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| What will that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| Will there be key card entry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| I'm not sure that we have that level of detail, but we're contemplating something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| for Menvilla and I think it would be the same situation, but essentially a single access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5246)|
| 1:27:31| point where there's a management desk and office to see the comings and goings, who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5251)|
| 1:27:37| coming and going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5257)|
| 1:27:38| It would be manned 24 hours either by a case manager provided by Volunteer Ministry Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| or in the overnight hours by some sort of case manager support staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| So there would be 24-hour security on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5268)|
| 1:27:53| I suspect that the back portion of the land, it's got a pretty steep hill going up towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5273)|
| 1:27:59| Chapman Highway, but I suspect that that would be fenced in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5279)|
| 1:28:03| Certainly not our intention to cage the residents in or make it feel like they're trapped, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5283)|
| 1:28:07| I think there would be security in the sense that you've got a single access point and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| eyes on that entrance all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| And you did say that the facility would have 24-hour security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5295)|
| 1:28:19| I'm not sure I would call it security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5299)|
| 1:28:22| That's what I heard you say a minute ago, so rephrase that for me in terms of what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5302)|
| 1:28:25| thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5305)|
| 1:28:26| We anticipate a similar model, and again, this is more of a programming question, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5306)|
| 1:28:31| I really would like VMC to address because I think they're the proper folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5311)|
| 1:28:36| We just didn't anticipate that we'd be discussing some of the detail of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5316)|
| 1:28:39| But they would provide, we've talked generally about having three shifts of a case manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5319)|
| 1:28:44| who is assigned to that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| Generally speaking, one case manager can handle a caseload of about 24, 25 individuals, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5327)|
| 1:28:52| is one reason this is an efficient design, because we can get 48 units in there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| have two case managers assigned to that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| So if we had three shifts, say eight-hour shifts of case managers, there would be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5340)|
| 1:29:04| case manager on-site at the property for 24 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5344)|
| 1:29:08| Now that overnight shift is where it may not be a case manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5348)|
| 1:29:13| It might be one of VMC's support staff or someone without perhaps a master's in sociology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5353)|
| 1:29:23| I'm not sure what their specifications would be, but it's not in our intention to necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5363)|
| 1:29:27| put a uniformed officer or an off-duty cop or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5367)|
| 1:29:32| And what is the guest policy for the 10-year plan permanent supportive housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5372)|
| 1:29:38| I'm not familiar with one, if there's one existing, and again, I think that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5378)|
| 1:29:42| that there would probably be some uniformity between the projects, but I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5382)|
| 1:29:48| something we would need to work out with VMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| I would think that would be important, you know, if these units are small and designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5391)|
| 1:29:56| for one individual who's under the supervision of a caseworker, that, you know, you wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5396)|
| 1:30:03| want multiple other visitors or part-time residents in that building who were not enrolled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5403)|
| 1:30:10| in the supportive program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| And just generally speaking, I do want to point out that a lot of the issues and concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5413)|
| 1:30:17| that have been raised, we've had some public meetings to discuss them with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5417)|
| 1:30:22| but we certainly would expect to continue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| Again, specifically at the use on review application, but also going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5425)|
| 1:30:32| So this is, I don't want to give the impression that this is, or at least it wasn't my impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5432)|
| 1:30:38| that this meeting would be to determine all of the details of the operation of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5438)|
| 1:30:43| I do think a lot of the questions you're asking are excellent questions, and those are some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| of the details that need to be worked out, looking at best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5447)|
| 1:30:50| And one last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| Mr. Swanson, we obviously are just discussing the rezoning tonight, and a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5452)|
| 1:30:57| would be required to utilize Flanagan School as permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5457)|
| 1:31:03| That decision for the use on review would be made by the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| Is that then appealable to council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5469)|
| 1:31:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5470)|
| 1:31:11| I'll go to Ms. Peele, I don't think you've commented yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| I just could not hear your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5476)|
| 1:31:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5479)|
| 1:31:20| I asked Mr. Swanson, if this rezoning is approved tonight, then the usage for multifamily would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5480)|
| 1:31:27| require a use on review in the O1, and if MPC would make that decision, is that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5487)|
| 1:31:32| appealable to council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| And Mr. Swanson said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| Well, yes, and I was just reading from the minutes of the MPC meeting, which I did attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5496)|
| 1:31:42| so I had heard this discussion at that time, quoting Ms. Craig, Rachel Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5502)|
| 1:31:48| Her comment at the end, really the conclusion of the discussion was, we are considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5508)|
| 1:31:54| the rezoning today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| This property is half zoned office and half zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5516)|
| 1:31:59| The proposal is to put it all back into office, which is much better use for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5519)|
| 1:32:05| It is much less intensive and makes sense for the entire parcel to be zoned the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5525)|
| 1:32:10| way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5530)|
| 1:32:11| The use will be coming up for our discussing at the use on review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5531)|
| 1:32:16| I'm going to support this rezoning because that is what is before us today, and it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5536)|
| 1:32:21| simply rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5541)|
| 1:32:22| And I was sitting here thinking that this is incumbent upon us to realize tonight that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5542)|
| 1:32:28| we are really considering the rezoning and not the, as has been commented, all of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5548)|
| 1:32:35| specifics about the plan for the use of the property or the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5555)|
| 1:32:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5560)|
| 1:32:41| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5561)|
| 1:32:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5562)|
| 1:32:43| Mr. Perkins, a question for you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5563)|
| 1:32:46| There is a difference between commercial zoning and office zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5566)|
| 1:32:50| Office is a little less intensively used versus commercial and having a business, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5570)|
| 1:32:58| we've got a piece of property that as you travel northwest, if not just west, you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5578)|
| 1:33:07| into a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| If you were going to rezone to something, as you transition to a neighborhood, wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5589)|
| 1:33:15| the preference be to an office buffer versus a C3 commercial buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5595)|
| 1:33:22| If indeed the purposes for that rezoning were it to maintain an office standing, if it were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5602)|
| 1:33:31| to serve as offices, perhaps that would be legitimate, though maybe naive at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5611)|
| 1:33:38| Yes, I would agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5618)|
| 1:33:43| As Councilman Pelo pointed out, we've got the same parcel of property with two different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5623)|
| 1:33:51| zonings on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5631)|
| 1:33:52| I see your point, but if you go to a C3, all of a sudden you've got a C3 in a residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5632)|
| 1:33:58| area, and at least it's not a C4, but I have a little concern there about the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5638)|
| 1:34:10| And I think, if I recall the discussions at MPC and the recommendation of staff, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5650)|
| 1:34:18| this was a good transitional zoning for the very reason that you observed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5658)|
| 1:34:24| I missed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5666)|
| 1:34:27| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5667)|
| 1:34:28| You want to go to Vice Mayor Becker, and then I'll come back over to Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5670)|
| 1:34:31| I think this is actually a question that Mr. Holquist might know the answer to best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| There's a lot of talk, especially from Mr. Minichiello, about sort of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5674)|
| 1:34:39| of the area and the comeback of Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5679)|
| 1:34:44| And I know we have a Vestal plan now that's pretty detailed, and actually, over the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5684)|
| 1:34:48| 20 years, maybe a lot of planning in the Vestal area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5688)|
| 1:34:53| Are you familiar, Joe, with how much of that – I know it's a couple blocks from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| school down to downtown Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| Do you know, is there any in the current plans we've got for Vestal, any connection with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5699)|
| 1:35:04| Flennican that's worth talking about that you're aware of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5704)|
| 1:35:08| I don't picture any, but it seemed an interesting thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5708)|
| 1:35:12| Well, the current Vestal plan, there are two parts to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5712)|
| 1:35:17| First of all, the redevelopment plan that this council approved, which is an area that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5717)|
| 1:35:21| is larger than the targeted area, but does not extend this far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5721)|
| 1:35:28| It does not extend up Martin Mill Pike or Maryville Pike to the Flennican site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5728)|
| 1:35:33| It doesn't get that close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| Like you say, a couple of long blocks would be one way of describing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5735)|
| 1:35:40| I don't know – it's actually more than two blocks, because there are some sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5740)|
| 1:35:44| irregular intersections there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5744)|
| 1:35:47| That area, in turn, is larger than the targeted area, and it's larger than the current planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5747)|
| 1:35:53| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5753)|
| 1:35:54| So without going into a lot of detail, unless you feel like you need more detail – in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5754)|
| 1:36:00| fact, we restricted where the first $500,000 – the only money that was allocated so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5760)|
| 1:36:07| through empowerment zone funds, that funding process, we restricted that to the target| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5767)|
| 1:36:12| area, which is a sub-area within the overall redevelopment area, and that is, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5772)|
| 1:36:18| where the only planning has occurred so far – planning slash urban design slash engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5778)|
| 1:36:23| preliminary engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| So while it's close, it's not in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5785)|
| 1:36:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| Mr. Donaldson, there's been requests – we have a petition here with, I think, 232 signatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5795)|
| 1:36:45| is what the note on the face of it says – I haven't tried to count them – from folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5805)|
| 1:36:50| in the community asking that this be given another look because C3 – since it's kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5810)|
| 1:36:59| of odd in that the parcel was split, even the existing building was split with the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| line so that C3 is part of it and O1 is part of it and it splits a single parcel in a single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5824)|
| 1:37:12| building and what came from the planning commission was a recommendation to rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5832)|
| 1:37:21| that part that's now C3 to O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5841)|
| 1:37:25| The request from the community embodied in this petition is to look at and consider rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5845)|
| 1:37:34| the portion that's O1 to C3 as an alternative, and I can't tell from the record if that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5854)|
| 1:37:43| were ever formally considered by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5863)|
| 1:37:49| Since it's a single parcel, I don't know how that comes into play because it appears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5869)|
| 1:37:56| that MPC only considered the portion of the property that's currently zoned C3 in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5876)|
| 1:38:03| of rezoning and did not consider the entire parcel and did not discuss and therefore did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5883)|
| 1:38:09| not consider the option of C3 zoning for the entire parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| Would you say that's a correct assessment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5894)|
| 1:38:19| With this case, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| If you look back to 1998 when was the last time that the parcel was designated as public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5901)|
| 1:38:30| on the land use plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| There was a request from Brown and Brown Construction Company to change the plan designation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5912)|
| 1:38:38| zoning on the entire parcel, which at that time was four plus acres, to commercial and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5918)|
| 1:38:45| at that time the planning commission and the city council denied that request and instead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5925)|
| 1:38:50| put in place the office designation and the O1 zoning along Merrillville Pike as a buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5930)|
| 1:38:57| to that neighborhood to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5937)|
| 1:39:02| That has been considered in the recent past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5942)|
| 1:39:07| Since then there have been a plan amendment and rezoning on the east side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5947)|
| 1:39:14| On the east side of the property adjacent to Merrillville Pike, Martin Mill Pike, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5954)|
| 1:39:23| the current senior housing is, that was changed to O1 office in 2004 and then subsequently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5963)|
| 1:39:31| changed to R2 in 2005, which essentially stranded that C3 piece in the middle of what was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5971)|
| 1:39:40| old school parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| So the original request from public to something was for commercial on the entire parcel, city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5983)|
| 1:39:51| council put in place office on the west and commercial on the east at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=5991)|
| 1:40:03| Certainly the one year plan has indicated that for some time now, indicated office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6003)|
| 1:40:12| There is a discrepancy in that the sector plan, which is really supposed to be the broader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6012)|
| 1:40:21| plan that gives vision for the area, has indicated that that would be, indicates commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6021)|
| 1:40:29| for that entire area, everything between Martin Mill and Merrillville Pike and Flinnican.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6029)|
| 1:40:36| But the office zone districts are allowed uses within the sector plan designation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6036)|
| 1:40:40| commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6040)|
| 1:40:41| Sorry, say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| The office zone districts are allowed within the commercial sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6043)|
| 1:40:49| Yeah, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| I guess where I'm trying to get here is there seems to be significant interest in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6052)|
| 1:41:01| both the neighborhood folks, the individual residents, and the business community at taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6061)|
| 1:41:07| another look at this and considering, not necessarily, well, I think their request is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6067)|
| 1:41:14| to actually rezone according to the petition, but certainly at least considering the option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6074)|
| 1:41:21| of blocking out the entire property, again, with one zone, but rather than O1, looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6081)|
| 1:41:27| at making it C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6087)|
| 1:41:30| It appears that that has not been part of this current process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6090)|
| 1:41:35| It may have, in one sense or another, as you say, come up in the past through previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6095)|
| 1:41:43| rezonings, but that doesn't appear to have been considered by MPC and, therefore, legally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6103)|
| 1:41:52| or technically cannot be considered by this council in this rezoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| Would you say that's correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| That's correct with this case, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6123)|
| 1:42:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6124)|
| 1:42:04| Right now, there's no motion at all on the floor, just as a way of reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6124)|
| 1:42:10| I think I'm right, aren't I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| Vice Mayor, excuse me, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6134)|
| 1:42:15| I guess this question is for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6135)|
| 1:42:21| Back to the downtown Vestal Plan, which some money has been appropriated to, I'm having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6141)|
| 1:42:26| difficulty on my map locating where that intersection is, where Peace Furniture and all is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6146)|
| 1:42:33| Can you tell me what the cross streets are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6153)|
| 1:42:36| That is at Martin Mill, and I believe the cross street is Ogle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6156)|
| 1:42:41| It would be just off of the map on the bottom part where that NC is on the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6161)|
| 1:42:46| designation that's Neighborhood Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6166)|
| 1:42:51| I believe that is about where the intersection is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| So it's just off the map, on the map that we have in our packet to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6174)|
| 1:42:59| It's about 2,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6179)|
| 1:43:02| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6184)|
| 1:43:07| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| I was going to make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| There's a motion and a second to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| Is there further discussion on the motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6194)|
| 1:43:18| Just barely off the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6198)|
| 1:43:22| Okay, there's a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6202)|
| 1:43:25| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6205)|
| 1:43:26| You're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6206)|
| 1:43:27| Well, I'm not sure of the best way to proceed here, but I really feel like it would be good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6207)|
| 1:43:36| for this council to be able to consider the options that the citizenry has requested it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6216)|
| 1:43:42| to consider, and we can't do that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6222)|
| 1:43:46| So I'm going to make a substitute motion to remand this back to MPC to also consider the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6226)|
| 1:43:54| C3 zoning for the entire parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6236)|
| 1:43:57| Okay, there's a substitute motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6237)|
| 1:44:01| Is there further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6241)|
| 1:44:07| Am I allowed to speak to the timing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6247)|
| 1:44:10| Mr. Becker can call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6250)|
| 1:44:11| Let me ask Mr. Weining if he has an opinion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6251)|
| 1:44:14| Mr. Becker is asking for your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| I do have an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6256)|
| 1:44:17| Thank you for asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6257)|
| 1:44:18| Just a couple of quick points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| From a timing perspective, I would ask that you not delay it or not send it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6260)|
| 1:44:25| The funding sources that Mr. Lawler mentioned have time commitments that we're on a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6265)|
| 1:44:29| tight schedule to try to meet that include the proper zoning of the property, so we really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6269)|
| 1:44:35| do need to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6275)|
| 1:44:39| Generally speaking, if I can be rather blunt, I think many folks here would agree that multi-dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6279)|
| 1:44:46| use for that property may well be its highest and best use, and I think if we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6286)|
| 1:44:50| about anything other than the tenants that we're proposing for this property, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6290)|
| 1:44:55| think we're having this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| I think it's already been rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6296)|
| 1:44:59| As Councilmember Roddy has pointed out, there's a lot of details and a lot of concerns of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6299)|
| 1:45:03| the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| I want to say very clearly and publicly, we hear those concerns, but we also feel strongly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6304)|
| 1:45:10| that we can address and remedy and have a conversation that's going to make a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6310)|
| 1:45:16| development, and we would like that opportunity as we go forward at the appropriate point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6319)|
| 1:45:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6320)|
| 1:45:21| Vice Mayor, your light's still on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6321)|
| 1:45:24| I guess I don't think I'm going to support this amendment, and I think it actually has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| to go with more to what Councilman Frost said earlier about how zoning ought to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6327)|
| 1:45:33| At some level, a commercial zone directly next to a residential is more of a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6333)|
| 1:45:40| than an office zone, especially an office zone that's actually a residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6340)|
| 1:45:47| This feels like I would not support a commercial zone for this property, so I don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6347)|
| 1:45:56| talk about sending it back in this case, so I think I'm going to vote against the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6356)|
| 1:46:01| because I think that office or residential is a proper zone for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6361)|
| 1:46:10| I think Councilman Holquist's light was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| I appreciate the Vice Mayor's comments, and I think an argument can be made either way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6373)|
| 1:46:18| in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6378)|
| 1:46:19| I think the situation we have, as Mr. Minichiello has pointed out, is an area that has had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6379)|
| 1:46:26| lot of difficult pressures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| It's been subject to a lot of different conflicting demands, pressures, et cetera, and fragile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6388)|
| 1:46:36| is probably an apt description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6396)|
| 1:46:40| This piece of property is essentially within what's a commercial corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6400)|
| 1:46:45| I sort of saw to slightly, but it is a commercial corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6405)|
| 1:46:52| I would not be comfortable in saying I'm convinced that commercial is the best use at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6412)|
| 1:46:59| but neither am I comfortable in saying that a very intensive multifamily use is the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6419)|
| 1:47:05| appropriate at this point either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| My position is that I think we need to take a very clear look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6428)|
| 1:47:14| Concerning Mr. Arning's statement about the timeliness of this decision, I certainly understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6434)|
| 1:47:20| their position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| I think the other side of that coin is, and he's pointed out, that this decision is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6442)|
| 1:47:27| to lock everyone in for a long time if they proceed ahead with the use that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6447)|
| 1:47:32| in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| Most of that corridor, there's a lot of commercial property that's locked up with two families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6455)|
| 1:47:40| that don't like to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6460)|
| 1:47:41| They like to do ground leases, and it has been a detriment to vibrant commercial development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6461)|
| 1:47:50| and so we're constantly looking for opportunities and trying to encourage investors to invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6470)|
| 1:47:56| in commercial use within that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6476)|
| 1:48:01| If we're locking up this property for a minimum of 15 years, and as Mr. Minichiello pointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6481)|
| 1:48:05| out, there's also a 30-year component in there that I've heard about in the past with other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6485)|
| 1:48:10| projects using these tax credits, low-income housing tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6490)|
| 1:48:16| So I don't know exactly how that works, but I was told on another project that fortunately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| did not go through that it would have been locked up for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6499)|
| 1:48:23| So whether it's 15 years or 30 years, that's a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6503)|
| 1:48:27| So while time is maybe the essence in terms of moving the project forward in one sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6507)|
| 1:48:34| time can be our friend, time can be our enemy, I think if we don't take a very careful look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6514)|
| 1:48:41| and make sure that we know what our options are, what's the best thing for the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6521)|
| 1:48:46| community, which is what we're supposed to do when we do zoning and get more feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6526)|
| 1:48:50| I mean, we've got a petition with a whole lot of names on it, and that alone should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6530)|
| 1:48:55| tell us that they're asking for commercial zoning, and this is including the people right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6535)|
| 1:49:00| around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6540)|
| 1:49:01| I mean, look at the streets, Flinnegan, Martin Mill, I think, I know Maryville Pike, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6541)|
| 1:49:06| all on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6546)|
| 1:49:07| And so the question is if those people are asking for it, shouldn't that raise a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6547)|
| 1:49:12| in our minds as to whether or not we've really got all the information we need to make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| right decision here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| And while, again, while I appreciate Mr. Arning's position and his concern about timing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6559)|
| 1:49:25| and I don't want to create problems for them and their program, by zone admission, once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6565)|
| 1:49:34| we've moved forward, we're locked, and we're locked for a very long time with this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6574)|
| 1:49:39| use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6579)|
| 1:49:40| Whereas if we rezoned at office and otherwise and we saw transitional activity, we saw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6580)|
| 1:49:48| as we usually do, we would see somewhere down the road perhaps a different owner coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6588)|
| 1:49:53| in and petitioning for rezoning at some point to commercial or perhaps some mixed-use district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6593)|
| 1:49:59| that might be on the table at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6599)|
| 1:50:02| And that's the normal process, but I think these are extraordinary circumstances, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6602)|
| 1:50:07| we just need to take a higher degree of care and consideration perhaps than we normally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6607)|
| 1:50:14| would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6614)|
| 1:50:15| Thank you very much for making the motion to send it back to MPC to consider the option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6615)|
| 1:50:20| that they have not considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6620)|
| 1:50:22| We'll go back to Ms. Pelo, and then I'll go back to the Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6622)|
| 1:50:26| Well, I appreciate that because I wanted to respond in a sense to you, Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6626)|
| 1:50:32| You know, I realize it's one of those things where my trash is your treasure or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6632)|
| 1:50:38| and so we view things differently, but I guess I'm looking at the thought that locking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6638)|
| 1:50:46| it in for 15 years seems to you to be a negative, but in my thinking it's a very positive because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6646)|
| 1:50:55| it means that in looking at a 15-year use there and a commitment there, that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6655)|
| 1:51:02| been a lot of strong consideration about whether this is going to be truly a big commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6662)|
| 1:51:10| I think my concern would be if you come in there and do something and have no strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6670)|
| 1:51:16| commitment for a number of years, well, then this could become vacant property again, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6676)|
| 1:51:22| to me is very negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6682)|
| 1:51:25| And you know I have a real personal interest in South Knoxville because my family invested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6685)|
| 1:51:33| so heavily there a number of years ago, and it was a good thing for us for a while, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6693)|
| 1:51:39| you know that building that meant so much to me and meant so much to my family is sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6699)|
| 1:51:43| vacant, and I've watched it deteriorate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6703)|
| 1:51:47| And I think one thing that troubles me so much about why areas deteriorate and lose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6707)|
| 1:51:53| their value is because we begin to see vacancies and we begin to see things, you know, move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6713)|
| 1:51:59| out with nothing that wants to come in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6719)|
| 1:52:03| And so the value is lost for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6723)|
| 1:52:06| And I think that's the reason that the lock-in, as you all are calling it, is to me just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6726)|
| 1:52:13| opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6733)|
| 1:52:14| It's a very positive thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6734)|
| 1:52:15| It means that we have a program, we have an opportunity where people have committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6735)|
| 1:52:23| themselves to a period of time to being a part of the building block of that part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6743)|
| 1:52:28| South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6748)|
| 1:52:30| So I see that as a very strong point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6750)|
| 1:52:34| And I was so impressed with Ms. Craig's comments at MPC and how I think she viewed it in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6754)|
| 1:52:40| way too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6760)|
| 1:52:42| So always two sides to the coin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6762)|
| 1:52:46| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6766)|
| 1:52:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6767)|
| 1:52:48| I mean, it just, again, next to the senior apartments, the idea of somebody putting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6768)|
| 1:52:56| you know, ineffective McDonald's in there seems a horrible use for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6776)|
| 1:53:01| And that's what a C-3 would allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6781)|
| 1:53:02| I mean, I don't see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6782)|
| 1:53:04| This feels like the use of this is residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6784)|
| 1:53:10| I mean, actually, I think there's a great question of why nobody applied for residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| for this, because that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6793)|
| 1:53:14| But I think clearly it's because part of it was already zoned office and you could get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6794)|
| 1:53:19| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6799)|
| 1:53:20| This is a zoning decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| And there's a use on review later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6802)|
| 1:53:25| There's no commercial adjacent to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6805)|
| 1:53:26| And I don't see this being commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6806)|
| 1:53:30| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6810)|
| 1:53:33| Well, just to respond to Councilman Pelos' comments, I guess I would have to take exception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6813)|
| 1:53:42| to those comments, because by saying that it's a good thing to lock in to low-income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6822)|
| 1:53:50| housing for 15 years implies that that's the best we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6830)|
| 1:53:57| And I think there's much evidence to the contrary, and it's certainly my hope, and I'm sure the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6837)|
| 1:54:02| hope of pretty much everybody here that resides in South Knoxville, and probably everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6842)|
| 1:54:10| that resides in South Knoxville, I would think, pretty much everybody, that we are seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6850)|
| 1:54:16| changes that are going to be transformative, waterfront redevelopment, vestal redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6856)|
| 1:54:24| and hopefully what we'll see come out of eventually the embryonic efforts to begin to plan for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6864)|
| 1:54:30| Chapman Highway redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6870)|
| 1:54:33| As we look as a city over the next decade and two decades, we anticipate seeing tremendous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6873)|
| 1:54:42| transition and change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6882)|
| 1:54:44| This administration is focusing on South Waterfront, Cumberland Avenue, Downtown North slash Central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6884)|
| 1:54:51| Avenue, that area, and beginning to focus some on the Magnolia Corridor as areas, these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6891)|
| 1:55:00| core city areas that can be targeted for redevelopment, and we expect to see over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6900)|
| 1:55:06| a tremendous amount of growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6906)|
| 1:55:07| I would say that the next administration will probably, hopefully, expand that vision, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6907)|
| 1:55:13| I certainly would like to see that vision include building on what's already been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6913)|
| 1:55:18| with the South Waterfront, with vestal, and the beginnings of the effort with Chapman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| Highway Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| And so I would say that if we believe that locking in for 15 years or more with low-income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6924)|
| 1:55:33| housing in an area that's within essentially the boundary or that corridor is the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6933)|
| 1:55:43| we can do, then I think we've set our expectations very low, and I, for one, have much, much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6943)|
| 1:55:49| higher expectations and a vision, I believe, for where we can go as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6949)|
| 1:55:54| And I think there are many of us that share that vision and think that we can accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6954)|
| 1:55:59| a great deal, and we would like to see this council share in our hope, at least, if not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6959)|
| 1:56:08| in the vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6968)|
| 1:56:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6969)|
| 1:56:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6970)|
| 1:56:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6971)|
| 1:56:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6973)|
| 1:56:14| Ready about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6974)|
| 1:56:15| The motion on the floor is a substitute motion that Mr. Holquist made, and there was a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6975)|
| 1:56:21| to that, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6981)|
| 1:56:22| So we're ready to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6982)|
| 1:56:23| All those in favor of the substitute motion, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6983)|
| 1:56:27| I heard Holquist, Booker, and Hall as ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6987)|
| 1:56:31| All those opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6991)|
| 1:56:33| I heard the other six as no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=6993)|

| 1:57:22| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7042)|
| 1:57:23| Yeah, I have a question, I guess, for Mr. Lyons on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7043)|
| 1:57:29| And this is something, I know this is only first reading, and you might want to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7049)|
| 1:57:33| about this over the weeks, but sort of the Blackstock area is part of the downtown north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7053)|
| 1:57:37| redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7057)|
| 1:57:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7058)|

| 1:57:43| And whether we need to do some more planning and not just sort of do a mixed use, parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7063)|
| 1:57:47| by parcel, but a more generic one, I don't know if you have any thoughts on that now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7067)|
| 1:57:52| but I'd sort of like to think about that one before second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7072)|
| 1:57:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7077)|

| 1:59:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7161)|
| 1:59:22| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7162)|
| 1:59:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7163)|
| 1:59:24| Mr. Donaldson, this proposal is to go to R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7164)|
| 1:59:29| Why wouldn't you go to R1 considering most of these lots are so small anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7169)|
| 1:59:34| They're less than 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7174)|
| 1:59:37| The essential effect is that they are R1, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7177)|
| 1:59:42| Within that proposed area there are some multi-dwelling structures existing and we're a little uncomfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7182)|
| 1:59:49| making those non-conforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7189)|
| 1:59:50| But they'd be pre-existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7190)|
| 1:59:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7191)|
| 1:59:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7192)|
| 1:59:53| I was just wondering, considering I'm pretty familiar with the area and there's very few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7193)|
| 2:00:02| lots that would really, truly be R1A, I was just wondering why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7202)|
| 2:00:10| Yeah, most of the lots wouldn't meet the current R1 standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7210)|
| 2:00:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7216)|
| 2:00:17| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7217)|
| 2:00:19| Yeah, again, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7219)|
| 2:00:21| It's actually sort of a related question on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7221)|
| 2:00:25| If the R1HK were actually a zone, if we'd finish that, my sense is this would be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7225)|
| 2:00:31| ideal use for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7231)|
| 2:00:36| I'm a little frustrated because my neighborhood's decided to wait on the R1HK rather than downzone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7236)|
| 2:00:41| to R1 or R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7241)|
| 2:00:44| I'm wondering why, well, one, why it's taking so long, but also just why not wait and rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7244)|
| 2:00:51| this R1HK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7251)|
| 2:00:52| And I know that's kind of a broad question for 9 o'clock at night, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7252)|
| 2:00:58| The request came from council by way of resolution a couple months ago at the request of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7258)|
| 2:01:04| neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7264)|
| 2:01:05| Traditionally, when property has been rezoned from R2, we have used that interim R1A zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7265)|
| 2:01:13| district rather than going all the way to R1, because there may have been some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7273)|
| 2:01:18| who made some investment decisions based on the R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7278)|
| 2:01:23| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7283)|
| 2:01:24| Yeah, Vice Mayor Becker, I'm wondering if perhaps it would make sense to pass this or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7284)|
| 2:01:31| approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7291)|
| 2:01:32| But keep in mind, of course, some of us may not be here when it happens, but keep in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7292)|
| 2:01:37| that we may want to revisit it when that option is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7297)|
| 2:01:43| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7303)|
| 2:01:44| This is all frustration from waiting on R1HK since about my election day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7304)|
| 2:01:51| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7311)|
| 2:01:52| Like I say, some of us may not be here when it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| I think R1HK predated EMCs, if that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7314)|
| 2:01:58| Ask Councilman Hall about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7318)|
| 2:02:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7322)|

| 2:05:26| But please keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7526)|
| 2:05:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7528)|
| 2:05:29| Well, whereas our taxpayer dollars should be spent to maximize the creation of American| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7529)|
| 2:05:33| jobs and restoring the economy and the vitality of the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7533)|

| 2:05:42| I didn't even know that was going to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7542)|

| 2:05:53| Well, this resolution is not about, as you explained in your email, more litigation or more government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7553)|

| 2:06:16| from the government in our communities should be spent on American-made products and American jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7576)|
| 2:06:27| And this proposal, as you can review it here, whereas any domestic products produced that are purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7587)|
| 2:06:38| with economic recovery plan monies will immediately help struggling American families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7598)|
| 2:06:43| and will help stabilize our greater Knoxville economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7603)|
| 2:06:48| Now, what I'm asking here is for you guys to sign this resolution that will help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7608)|
| 2:06:55| in recognizing that American products and American services should be first and foremost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7615)|
| 2:07:07| The pencils you buy for your desk, the computers you buy, anything that you purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7627)|
| 2:07:14| or any services that you have should come right from our own communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7634)|
| 2:07:21| not foreign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7641)|
| 2:07:26| They should be domestic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7646)|

| 2:07:33| to rebuilding what we have lost in jobs and services right here in our own community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7653)|

| 2:07:48| and this comes from my heart, and I work with other laborers in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090505?start=7668)|
