| 0:02:43| Hopefully you'll still be here, but may be departing and just to kind of talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=163)|
| 0:02:49| Different traditions and also cultures that get created and as you move forward in the years to come you may choose to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=169)|
| 0:02:58| Continue some of those traditions or or change them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| Since I've been on council, we've added a few but generally kept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=182)|
| 0:03:07| most of the traditions intact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| But in a few minutes, I'll get back to more about the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| And so we can go ahead and start with the city departments. And again, thank you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=194)|

| 0:04:17| Do that or not? That's their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| Decision but just kind of traditionally how they work with your department and a quick quick overview of what you handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=259)|

| 0:06:13| I don't know whether it'll be the same or similar or totally different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| but you know, we'll we'll roll with things as as our mayor-elect comes in and and gives his instructions, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=378)|

| 0:06:39| Serve as the director of Public Works. There is no Public Works Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=399)|
| 0:06:45| Public Works is a I guess a compilation of those three departments and that's that's how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=405)|
| 0:06:52| it was organized and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| And it has it has functioned pretty well as those of you have been here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| No, but let me just give you a brief summary of each of those and then we'll move on if there's no questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=420)|

| 0:07:47| We typically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| We hope to run that section from a revenue neutral standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=469)|
| 0:07:55| We have not been able to do that in since the downturn in economy at one point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=475)|
| 0:08:01| We were making just a little bit of money. Not not a great deal him, but just just a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=481)|
| 0:08:08| You know right now. We we probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| You know probably cost us something like 2.4 million to run the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| office and we are probably only going to bring in a little over a million in permit fees and that's just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=496)|

| 0:12:20| and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| Steve's already described his area. Jim will will talk about finance. I think what is the the good news?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=742)|

| 0:12:48| and cat which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| Out of necessity over the the past year particularly with cat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=770)|
| 0:12:55| Bill lines and I have split responsibility for that. My primary focus was on the operation side of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=775)|
| 0:13:03| Bills was as there are policy matters in involving cats, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=783)|
| 0:13:09| And community development you're pretty familiar with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=789)|

| 0:17:38| To prepare the budget and the budget really sets the framework for everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| We do as part of the city and and we'll be starting that probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| The process sometime around the end of January first part of February I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1068)|

| 0:18:05| to set the stage for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| The budget preparation and so we'll be meeting with all of you at that point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1087)|

| 0:18:15| Mr. King indicated we're always welcome. You're always welcome to come and and talk to us and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1095)|
| 0:18:23| Ask us questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| And we'll try and and answer those questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| If you have any more, like I said, I like to keep it short. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1110)|
| 0:18:40| Dr. Lines is with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| Policy and communications and dr. Lines has been here since for eight years now and is going to continue on so that's a good thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1123)|
| 0:18:51| And have you been interacting with the council? What how do you like to work with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| Well, I've been in interacting with the council in a variety any way that one can interact with the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| I think we both proactively and reactively that is we answer questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| Policy and communications is pretty wide-reaching in its scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| And I I think one thing I'll say before I continue on that mode is we're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| Restructured somewhat not sure exactly who's going to report to whom so I don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| Have the new council folks get used to for the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| Entirety of a week the present structure and then come in and confuse you by changing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| So I'll try to stay away from our structural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| Definitions right now, but in terms of interaction as vice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| Mayor Bailey asked we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| Very active in promoting what the city is doing what's coming up projects are coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1176)|
| 0:19:42| If something is of interest to one's district one in one's district or projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1182)|
| 0:19:47| You know that people are very interested in we're proactive and getting that information to folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| We also answer a lot of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| I think it's a two-way streets probably more traffic on the street coming to us in terms of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| directly between and among among council folks of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| We like not to have you surprised by things seeing by you're seeing things in the paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| So we would try to get in what we think are things you need to know about to you first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| And then you can see and read about them in the media. Sometimes this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| Something we don't totally succeed on partially because we're not sure exactly when things are going to come out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| We it's that is always difficult and and unfortunately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| If you don't have all that take place in a compact period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| Sometimes the the flow of information gets out too early and then the newspaper article isn't what it ought to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1229)|
| 0:20:35| So that's always a challenge that will continue to be a challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| To segue briefly and I'm going to try to be as succinct as I can here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| We're going to have a new structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| I'm going to be involved in many of the things I'm that I'm involved in now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| The reporting arrangements in the org chart will look a little different, but communications is obviously key| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| we're going to have a new senior director of communications along with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| Person who's Jesse May sharks because you saw is going to be replacing Randy Kenner is the communications manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| that that will be the department that that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| Both responding to media requests will often call counsel or when there's something that affects you that you need to know about in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1268)|
| 0:21:15| These media requests and we'll be getting out the all the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| Probably more so to you than for me personally as it's been in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| We also have the sustainability office, which will be very important and that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1283)|
| 0:21:29| Susanna Sutherland heads that up along with with Jake Tysinger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1289)|

| 0:21:44| But also a lot of energy weatherization and other sorts of programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| I think if you have any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| she will continue to be the one to speak to on that and she's also active in applying for grants the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1310)|

| 0:22:08| the biggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| Relative to amount of time we spend and scope and public attention is the redevelopment area and Bob| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| Wetzel is here and he's the director of redevelopment because under our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1336)|

| 0:22:48| Internal as much as as spreading out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| I think you all know that that we've seen some major changes because of that emphasis but anything with downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1370)|
| 0:22:56| Questions about town concerns the thing we hear the most about I'm as y'all probably do is parking challenges with parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1376)|
| 0:23:02| but but many other things the whole TIF program and pilot program and incentives for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| Redevelopment of these structures comes through our department and and Bob is the lead person on that as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| So that will that includes Cumberland downtown North| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| Magnolia Warehouse District and now South Waterfront in all four directions around the core of downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| Which we're hoping to grow into the old city and connectivity is sort of the key word in all of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| so any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| concerns questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1407)|

| 0:24:45| The attorneys are Allison Everting Doug Gordon Lisa Hatfield Angela Halbert and Jim Johnson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1485)|
| 0:24:52| We have what I feel is a very experienced staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| over the past eight years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| We've had one staff position turnover amongst the amongst the attorneys and that was by retirement of an attorney Sharon voice who retired after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1497)|
| 0:25:04| 30 some odd years with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| So we're very proud that we've we've been very stable in terms of our in terms of the lawyers in our office except for the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1506)|
| 0:25:12| director position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| In that same period we've only had one attorney added and that was essentially in anticipation of Sharon's retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1513)|
| 0:25:20| so we're we're very stable as far as that goes and we're looking forward to the to the newbie coming on in the next few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1520)|
| 0:25:27| Weeks and and we'll have some some fun with him as well. I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| We also have a support staff of four and we generally have one law clerk at a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| So we have some assistance there as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| In terms of our day-to-day operations. We have a number of different duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| We provide legal advice to the mayor and to all the city departments that ranges from top-level advice like issues on policy questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1544)|
| 0:25:52| Down to day-to-day operations. It's it's not at all unusual for us say to get questions on the phone from police officers in the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1552)|
| 0:26:00| You know, we we have those questions just about all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| We also provide legal advice to various city boards and committees that are charged with enforcing the city code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| And these boards usually have a city attorney directly tasked to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| So that if the attorney is not there at the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| They're at least available by phone to answer questions from from those boards and those areas of concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1576)|
| 0:26:22| Covers everybody that you see here in the room. I mean basically codes enforcement animal control housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| the housing discrimination stormwater regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| zoning tax collection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| Basically everything the city is operating in that the law department is going to be involved in it in one way or another and our assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1593)|
| 0:26:40| Arranges from simply providing advice to drafting and reviewing documents and and regulations proposed regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1600)|
| 0:26:46| assisting with compliance in federal and state statutes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| and other other regulatory issues and bringing enforcement actions when necessary at the request of the individual department we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1610)|
| 0:26:59| Seldom are able to make the decision as to whether to bring an enforcement action that wrote that requires input from the department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1619)|
| 0:27:06| But whenever that decision is made within consultation with a law department. We were able to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1626)|
| 0:27:12| We also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| With the area where you're going to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| Most of our interaction and work most closely with us is in preparation of the City Council agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| I mean we manage the agenda preparation process from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| From beginning to end basically whenever the request for an agenda item comes in we will prepare the contract that goes with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| We will prepare the the resolution or ordinance that goes along with that. We will put the agenda together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1654)|
| 0:27:41| We'll work with the individual departments in terms of any tweaks or relationships with the contractors that are involved there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1661)|
| 0:27:49| And this goes all the way up to the City Council meeting as those of you who've been on council before have watched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| Know we're we're there one of the law director primarily is there but on occasion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| I'm there as well to offer advice during the course of the council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| Except for this legislative function. We are not unlike the corporate law department for a for a mid-sized corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1682)|
| 0:28:12| As you've probably seen as a governmental entity the city's subject to public scrutiny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| Sometimes things get ratcheted up to a degree that they might not if we were a private business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| We provide advice on media relations on on occasion what we can't say what we shouldn't say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1705)|
| 0:28:32| We will provide advice and requests for information on Open Records Act requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1712)|
| 0:28:39| My strong hope is that if any of you decide that you're going to run for governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| You let us know as early as possible because we need to talk about some open records issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| If there's a question that generates public interest within any of the departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| Chances are we're we're going to be involved in in that question at some point whether it's questions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1732)|
| 0:28:59| insurance issues that might threaten to cancel the the Christmas parade or boomsday to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| issues about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| protesters on Market Square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| To issues about critical incidents with the police department or fire department chances are where they're off to the side providing advice in those situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1747)|
| 0:29:14| There is a possibility we're going to hear about the Snoop Dogg concert before the night's over so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| We're involved in a number of different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| That's sometimes not a bad idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| We also occasionally take recommendations from city departments and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| and and the administration regarding state legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| we sometimes assist in drafting state legislations and working with lobbyists whether they're for the city directly or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1775)|
| 0:29:42| For other advocacy groups that we work with such as the Tennessee Association of Chiefs of Police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| the Tennessee Municipal League that type of thing as far as shepherding that litigate or that legislation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| And and getting that through the process to the best we can and then finally the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| Being lawyers that you would expect the most of and that's the litigation process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| We we do handle litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| That's one of the things that we're unlike a lot of a lot of corporate law departments. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| We defend and prosecute all lawsuits in which the city is involved and these range from contact claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1810)|
| 0:30:16| Contract claims rather to codes enforcement to zoning to employment claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| condemnation civil rights violations tort issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| We go from city court to a chancery court to circuit court to federal court to all the courts of appeals and other related bodies in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1826)|
| 0:30:33| Between so we're we handle that as far as litigation goes as well now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| One thing that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| Spent a number of years in private practice, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| It's it's really a nice change to be able to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| in a situation where you're you're tasked and you're you're called in from the beginning on issues where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1849)|
| 0:30:56| Departments will contact you and work with you in advance say hey, we need some help on this particular issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| Can you can you help us steer through a minefield if there is one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| It's a whole lot easier and a whole lot more pleasant to put the work in on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| From the legal standpoint than have to have to be called in on the back end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| Councilman de la Volpe, I'm sure you're familiar with that situation. It's much nicer to be in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| In that context there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| In terms of interaction with council and and constituent services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1880)|
| 0:31:29| But I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| Suppose I've been here long enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| In terms of constituent services one thing to remember is a lot of what we do as I've as I pointed out is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1894)|
| 0:31:41| Derivative of what goes on with the other departments, so it may be circumstances when you're dealing with questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| Other than litigation or questions other than the agenda process or specific legislative issues our response may be well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1907)|
| 0:31:54| Let me get with Department X and get back with you on that because oftentimes. It's going to be involving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1914)|
| 0:32:01| Working with that department and find out what the situation is, but you call us. We will get your response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1921)|

| 0:32:09| But we will get your response on those whether it's an individual request or a request on behalf of a constituent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1929)|
| 0:32:16| You call us we we answer the phone, and if you have any questions for me now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| I'll be glad to take those where I can defer those to mr.. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1940)|

| 0:32:31| You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| It's tough to follow a lawyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1955)|
| 0:32:41| Yeah happens quite often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| Obviously we handle the safety and security of the city and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| We we do have the largest department in the city. We have 558 employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1970)|
| 0:32:56| 416 of those our police officers are sworn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| police officers so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| Our budgets about 48 million dollars, which is about 28% of the city's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1982)|
| 0:33:09| So we we obviously understand our role and how how vital it is and and what we cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1989)|
| 0:33:17| the city and and we try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| Be very good stewards of that and we also try to keep our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| Outline cost we don't want to have Ron working too much or mr.. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2005)|
| 0:33:31| Working too much, so we we try to control that as well as far as what happens with our actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| And so we a lot of training and it goes into that so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| As far as our interaction with council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2021)|

| 0:34:00| but generally it is the sky is falling and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| And of course after we have vetted it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| Many times the sky is not falling and it's not as horrible as they've made it sound initially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| and and a lot of that has to do with perceptions and so when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| When we bore out all that and get down to the facts we can usually find out. What really is going on so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2058)|

| 0:35:01| Folks claim I don't sleep, but but I do get a couple hours, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2101)|

| 0:35:32| with that and and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| We get a lot of insight and give and take with those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| And so we and and it's not always perfect as we have found out recently and we're still kind of hammering out a couple of details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2137)|
| 0:35:45| on a recent one so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2145)|

| 0:42:49| Along with the fire inspectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2569)|

| 0:45:05| The more we do and the better we do it the more they expect us to continue doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| So that's that's one of our challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| some of the facts and figures about parks recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| Our current budget operating budget is a little more than six point eight million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| Which is approximately four percent of the city's operating budget. We've got 61 permanent employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2717)|
| 0:45:24| Who work in parks recreation the majority of those are people that work in our recreation centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| We have 13 community centers throughout the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| We've got literally hundreds of part-time employees that work for our department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2731)|

| 0:48:45| One of the challenges is is to fund and build new greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| Building a greenway is a long drawn-out process. It could take several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| We're fortunate to have has to have Steve King and Brent Johnson and and the civil engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2932)|
| 0:48:58| They've been really instrumental in helping us proceed building those new greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| But but greenways have gotten more expensive and more difficult to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| So I think the expectations from the population is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2945)|
| 0:49:08| We just need to step up and be able to fund and start the process to build those build those new facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2948)|
| 0:49:16| Think that's pretty much it just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| Interaction as far as where I interact a lot with council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| Emailing is the best way to reach me, but I'm also available at the office or on my cell phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| Phone calls dealing with issues like loose loose dogs in parks or dirty restrooms or issues regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2966)|
| 0:49:33| Referees somebody will call and they didn't care for the calls that were made last night's baseball game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2973)|
| 0:49:38| So we have to sit there and smile and listen for 30 minutes as they explain why why it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| Why the game was stolen from there from the transit? I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| Will thank Russ Jensen and 3-1-1 for screening some of those calls, but but still we do we do get our fair share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| But anyway, just it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| It's been it's been great of course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| We do have our publications our greenways map and our parks map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| And we were always constantly trying to interact with a public to let them aware it make them aware of what our our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3000)|
| 0:50:06| services are because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| As much as we tried oftentimes we'll have people say well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| I didn't know you had that recreation center just two blocks from my house, or I didn't know about that greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| I didn't know about that dog park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| So that's one of the biggest challenges is getting the word out and making sure that that people are aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3016)|
| 0:50:21| The facilities that are made available to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| And never saying questions. I'll take those if not. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| Thank You Joe Vicki Hatfield civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3028)|
| 0:50:36| They always saved me for last because you guys won't see me very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| I'm probably the department that you guys will have the least interaction with I am the civil service director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3039)|
| 0:50:45| And we're essentially the HR department for the city we do pretty much everything personnel related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3045)|
| 0:50:51| for city employees and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| Basically for those of you that don't know we are a civil service merit system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| And essentially what that means beyond just that we have a lot of rules and regulations that govern everything we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3058)|
| 0:51:05| Essentially if you want to boil it down it primarily means we have a merit-based hiring system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| So anyone who wants to come to work for the city almost every position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| We have is governed by that merit-based hiring they have to come in they have to meet certain qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| They have to take an examination they have to score in the top five those five people get referred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3078)|
| 0:51:23| Those are the ones that can be considered for the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| So it is it's a fairly rigid system, and we we monitor and maintain that system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| It also gives employees certain rights they have grievance and appeal rights that a lot of employees don't have in other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3090)|
| 0:51:36| That's sort of the heart of what civil service is piggyback to that we do all of the basically everything related to personnel for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3096)|
| 0:51:44| My involvement with you will primarily be isolated to the classification and compensation plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| You'll typically see me once a year at the conclusion of our salary survey process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| We are charged with doing a salary survey each year and at the end of that process in the spring will work with finance and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3121)|
| 0:52:02| To make any recommended changes to the classification and compensation structure bring that to you in the spring and that usually piggybacks the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3122)|
| 0:52:10| So typically that's the only time you're going to see me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| When we're making a change to that class comp structure in the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| But beyond that you know where you might use us more or or be able to use us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3137)|
| 0:52:23| From time to time I know the employee groups and various employees will contact you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| With concerns or issues things they'd like you to to hear and I'm always available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3147)|
| 0:52:33| To help you understand what our policies are I know I've had council members come down and say help me understand the compensation plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3153)|
| 0:52:40| How does this work or explain this policy to me so I can understand what this employees issue is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3160)|
| 0:52:46| We're always happy to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| Pull information for you. We maintain a lot of employment data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| So anytime you want, you know compensation information employee demographics, maybe you want to know what our turnover rates are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3172)|
| 0:53:00| Anything like that. We're happy to pull for you at any time. So beyond the required involvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3180)|
| 0:53:05| We're always available if you need information about employees or about some of our rules or policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| But beyond that our involvement will probably be pretty minimal and I'll I'll see you in May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3190)|
| 0:53:15| any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| Okay, thank you Vicki I took your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| you did and it was really great because it answered a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| Multitude of questions that have come before council and in other venues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| About the whole system and how it works and why some things are the way they are and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| Maybe that's not the way we want them to be but that is the way they are and there's a reason for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3215)|
| 0:53:40| So I would encourage other council members if you if they offer that class again, you have the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| It's a good three hours. Well spent we do that. We do that at least once a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3225)|
| 0:53:51| Yeah, it it's become a little more frequent than that. We actually did it twice in the last few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| Just and and we'll probably offer it early in the year simply because there will be so many new folks coming on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3237)|
| 0:54:04| Basically what that we do all of the training for the city with the exception of uniform. So all general government employees we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3244)|
| 0:54:11| Create and deliver all training in-house here at the city and we do that for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| This particular class that she's talking about is just it's civil service procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| So it's a pretty brief morning class usually about an hour and a half to two hours where I literally just go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3260)|
| 0:54:26| What is civil service and it's typically for supervisors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| New supervisors to help them understand the rules and regulations and policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| But it's a really good general overview of our employment system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| And how it works and why it works the way that it does so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| We'll probably be shooting that out and I think you guys get those notifications, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| That'll probably I'm thinking we'll probably be offering that in the early part of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| So if anyone's interested in that you're definitely welcome to come to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| Thank you. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| Last but not least Mark Donaldson MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3297)|
| 0:55:03| Well, I see that dinner has arrived and the only thing between you and dinner is me as Charles says don't blow it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3303)|
| 0:55:14| Want to thank Joe for for inviting us to a seat at the table that it happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| Not often enough and and both Larry Martin and Bill Lyons have been great about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3319)|
| 0:55:25| Including us in discussions as well. We are a bit of the redheaded stepchild of your family here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3325)|
| 0:55:31| We're independent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| Except that we work for you and we rely on your your funds to support our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3333)|

| 0:56:00| actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| Empowered by the state legislature as a regional planning Commission, but we certainly have these strong relationships with the Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3362)|
| 0:56:10| We have 36 employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3370)|

| 0:56:38| Our managers are all very experienced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| The one who's been around here the shortest time is probably Mike Carberry who's been here 25 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3402)|
| 0:56:47| Buzz Johnson's the deputy director Dan Kelly is director of the development services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111208?start=3407)|
