| 0:04:30| Any discussion? All in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=270)|

| 0:04:51| And have we already waived the second reading of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| We need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=294)|
| 0:04:56| Do we need to make a motion to do that? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| Okay, I move that we approve this on the first reading of the, or the first vote of the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=298)|
| 0:05:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| So, the wording on the agenda is specifically to approve it, not first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| So, I think a vote should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| You all have done what you needed to do. I mean, Ms. Babb, you've added the language that needs to be added. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=316)|
| 0:05:23| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| Okay, so we are, essentially we are approving this policy and it will be approved today so that our schools can go forward, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=324)|
| 0:05:33| So everybody understands. Okay, any other, Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| Could we clarify that by saying that we are going to waive second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| Yes, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| We are waiving second reading. If we approve this policy now, it will be policy. Is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| Okay, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| 6G, approve first reading of new Knox County Board of Education Policy D233, Technology Purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=354)|
| 0:06:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| We have a motion by Ms. Christie, a second by Ms. Owen. Discussion? Okay, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=362)|
| 0:06:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| 6H, discussion and possible action on Knox County Board of Education Policy C240, Face Coverings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=373)|
| 0:06:19| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| Do we have a second? I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=380)|
| 0:06:27| So we have, so essentially if I could just provide some background on the reason for adding this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=387)|
| 0:06:36| and then I believe, Ms. Babb, we have some public speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| So just so that everybody is aware, there's been a lot of rumors that we were looking at not having a face coverings policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=399)|
| 0:06:49| and that's not the case. As your email from Ms. Coatney stated last Friday, it just became evident that we needed to add this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=409)|
| 0:06:57| as an agenda item so that the board could weigh in on this issue regarding, with specific regard to how it's being implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=417)|
| 0:07:05| for the arts students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| So what I would like to see us add is basically on line 27, it says, or let me just read the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=429)|
| 0:07:19| Students, this is number three, line 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| Students, employees, and visitors may remove masks or face coverings on a case-by-case basis for specific instructional needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=442)|
| 0:07:31| and other activities such as, I would like to add in there, while performing an extracurricular activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=451)|
| 0:07:40| and then in parentheses, athletics, band, theater, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| And the reason for that is luckily our students in the fall and currently who are involved in football, cheer, basketball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=465)|
| 0:07:57| have been able to participate in their sport without a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| We've had very few issues with COVID spread from those and so I feel like we need to discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=481)|
| 0:08:09| I've heard from a lot of parents who feel like the same courtesy should be extended to their students who are in band and theater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=489)|
| 0:08:16| and so I would like to discuss extending the same to those students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=496)|
| 0:08:22| And so that was the purpose and the reason it wasn't added a couple weeks ago was I've been hoping that the policy that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=502)|
| 0:08:29| was appropriate to cover it but we still continue to have questions so I think we need clarifying language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=509)|
| 0:08:37| So I apologize that I didn't add it two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| I just thought that we could do what we needed to with this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=520)|
| 0:08:45| So that's the reason for the addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=525)|
| 0:08:48| And so Ms. Babb, if you want to go ahead and let's hear public forum, would that be okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=528)|
| 0:08:54| First could you sort of tell us again the wording that you would like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| And I'm open to other wording but what I had thought was on line 27 where it says such as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=539)|
| 0:09:07| that we would add while performing an extracurricular activity or we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=547)|
| 0:09:13| I don't really like the word extracurricular but something to that effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| and then have in parentheses band, athletics, theater, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=557)|
| 0:09:28| So thank you for letting me just kind of set the stage on why we've added it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=568)|
| 0:09:34| And it's difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| I know a lot of times when we have something on the agenda that we're not able to tell the public what the thought is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=575)|
| 0:09:44| and it's just added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| So anyway, that's the reason and now would be our time to be able to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| So if we can go ahead and do our public forum and then we'll discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| Yes, I'd like to call Rebecca Reeves for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=594)|
| 0:10:09| If you'll just come up there and then if you will state your name and county of residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| and then you'll have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| My name is Rebecca Reeves and I live at Pine Springs address in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=615)|
| 0:10:21| And I'm just going to go ahead and jump in and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| So I have four children, two in school and two in preschool daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| My younger two do not wear masks or go through any of the contact tracing or quarantining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| And amazingly, both of the schools that they have been to in the last year have done great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| No outbreaks, no death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| It's been smooth sailing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| However, my kindergartner and first grader who are in masks all day long, they keep the distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=640)|
| 0:10:45| They follow all the protocols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| But Knox County still seems to have more of an issue with contact tracing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| and quarantining problems more than we have a COVID problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| On February 4th, the news reported that there were 188 cases in the Knox County school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| between students and staff, but there were 2,163 in quarantine and isolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| Where are the private school and preschool numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| I have been talking to the parents of children in private school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| and they feel guilty for how we, Knox County parents, have been suffering while they've been faring so well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=673)|
| 0:11:19| And most of them don't wear masks and I have been verifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| The first few days, weeks and months of school, my kids came home complaining of dry mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| sore throat and chronic coughs that did not stop until Christmas break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| when they were home with me for three weeks not wearing a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| As soon as school started back and they were wearing masks again, the coughing began back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| My five-year-old now has panic attacks every single day when she has to put her mask on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| because she's tired of being sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| I have bought her every mask under the sun, but I don't need any more recommendations on masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| I need her sweet little face to be free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| She needs to smile and to be smiled at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| It has been proven over and over that children are not mass spreaders of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| Their body only takes in a fraction of the particle and our children are actually superheroes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| Years ago, a friend of mine had a child who was sick constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| She told the pediatrician, but she didn't understand why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| She used hand sanitizer several times a day, disinfected every surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| She kept her kid away from other children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| Sounds familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| The doctor looked at my friend and said, stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| You are the reason she is so sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| Her immune system has never had a chance to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| She needs germs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| She needs exposure or she will stay with the immune system of an infant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| I refuse to let my children go back to the immune system of an infant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| I'm making sure their immune system has muscles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| Just like Rocky or Mike Tyson wouldn't get in the ring without working out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=756)|
| 0:12:39| Me and my kids will not face COVID in the ring without a strong immune system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| So why do doctors and surgeons wear masks and why can't our kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| Well, medical professionals are fit tested for masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| They work with OSHA certified specialists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| All hospitals and medical facilities have optimal air quality control filtration systems built in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| by special OSHA certified people that go in to make sure that they have optimum air control in these buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=777)|
| 0:13:03| to help them breathe better in a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| So our children are in these non-certified and non-tested masks all day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| with no quality air control systems to help their much smaller bodies receive the extra oxygen that's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| As they fiddle with their masks, sneeze in them, scratch their rear ends and touch toilet seats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| pick up objects off the floor and then touch their mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| So we're not talking about the same kind of mask wearing as a surgeon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| The cross-contamination issue is even worse than if they have no mask at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| My kids' masks come home soaking wet, covered in dirt and food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| And this is not the same thing as building an immune system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| These wet masks are making the perfect breeding ground for bacteria colonies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| that get re-inhaled over and over into my kids' lungs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| Many of all of our friends and families who have had friends and family members with COVID pneumonia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=824)|
| 0:13:50| is a direct result of incorrect mask wearing from the bacteria infections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| No wonder my kids have had headaches, sore throats and coughs for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| I talked to their pediatrician about the masks and she said for the first few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| when she had to wear a mask all day every day, she had the same symptoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| Headaches, nausea, overall sense of not feeling well, but her body adapted to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=846)|
| 0:14:13| Your body can adapt to abuse and that doesn't make it okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| Just like a smoker who has adapted to cigarette smoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| a non-smoker will cough and get a dried out throat in a smoky room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| Like a frog in a pot of boiling water, your body can adapt to abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| Wearing a mask one time might not be harmful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| Just like drinking one glass of water in Flint, Michigan is probably not harmful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| But ask the residents there how their health is faring after drinking or bathing in it for a long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| So no, it's not just a mask, it's not just a drink of water and it's not just one cigarette.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| Masks have become our security blanket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| We didn't need them before and we don't need them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| But many have a hard time letting them go because of a false sense of security that they bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| I want them off of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| Sometimes collectively as a nation, we embrace something that is not healthy for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| like some of the crazy diet or exercise fads we've adopted over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| Later we realized that we had good intentions, but it's time for us to move on in a different direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| And just like the good intention we had to mask and quarantine our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| these are causing more harm than good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| The great news? We live in Tennessee, East Tennessee for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| And why I love this place is because we are volunteers and we can do what's right for our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| And I don't want to pull my kids out of Knox County, but I will if this doesn't stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| Hillary Godfrey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=929)|
| 0:15:45| Is Hillary Godfrey here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=945)|
| 0:15:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| Yes, if you will state your name and county of residence and you'll have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| Okay. My name is Hillary Godfrey and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| I want to first just thank you all for your work that you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| I don't want to take that away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| I know that the time and energy that you put in is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| And so I just want to thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| Moving forward, I'm here because I am concerned also about the use of masks in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| We didn't know much back in February and March of 2020, but we do know a lot more as time has gone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| It's been almost a year now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| One of the things I wanted to bring up was the Great Barrington Declaration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| It was something that was signed back in October 4th of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| It was written by three professors, one from Harvard, Oxford and Stanford University, all epidemiologists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=997)|
| 0:16:44| Some excerpts from this say, fortunately, our understanding of the virus is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| We know that vulnerability to death from COVID-19 is more than a thousandfold higher in the old and a firm than the young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1008)|
| 0:16:54| Indeed, for children, COVID-19 is less dangerous than many other harms, including influenza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1014)|
| 0:17:01| The most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits of reaching herd immunity is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1021)|
| 0:17:10| to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at the highest risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1030)|
| 0:17:16| We call this focus protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| Those who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| Simple hygiene measures, such as hand washing, staying at home when sick, should be practiced by everyone to reduce the herd immunity threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1042)|
| 0:17:29| Schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching, which I applaud you all for moving forward and doing in September of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1049)|
| 0:17:37| But in order to reach that normal life for our kids, they need to be going to school without masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| They need to go back to normal activities to see their teachers' faces and the kids around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| Some studies that have been done in accordance to masks was a study of cloth and medical masks in New Zealand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| And this is something that you can look up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| The conclusion came to the results caution against the use of cloth masks, which is across the board what our teachers and most of you have on in here right now, even our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1077)|
| 0:18:07| This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks, and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1091)|
| 0:18:17| Another study done by the Cancer Discovery, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research, says the nose and the mouth were designed to take in oxygen without strain, uninhibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1097)|
| 0:18:29| Prolonged mask use creates a moist environment that cultivates microbes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1109)|
| 0:18:34| That toxic environment not only forces the person to regurgitate their own waste, but also inudates the lungs with microbes that cause a toxic environment that feeds lung cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1114)|
| 0:18:44| So essentially, we don't know the long-term effects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| Are we willing to risk our kids wearing these masks for hours upon hours a day, cloth masks that hold the moisture and potentially get the microbes into their lungs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1127)|
| 0:18:59| My main point is that we're harming the kids with our current system, and I would like for there to be discussion on how we can change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1139)|
| 0:19:05| If the masks work, then why do we need contact tracing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| If everyone has a mask on, nobody else should be quarantined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| Healthy children should not have to stay at home and miss out on things happening in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| If the masks work, parents should be allowed in the school to partake in different things going on, be able to have lunch with their kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1158)|
| 0:19:26| But if the masks don't work, then why do we have them on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| I appreciate your time, and I hope that you'll consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| Bradley Pruitt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1177)|
| 0:19:49| Is Bradley Pruitt here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1189)|
| 0:19:59| Tanya Coates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1199)|
| 0:20:12| Tanya Coates, Knox County, president of the Knox County Education Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1212)|
| 0:20:19| The discussion, I appreciate the added language that you want to add to about wearing masks at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1219)|
| 0:20:27| And I do understand parents' concerns about students wearing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| Many of us educators don't want to wear masks either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| But, however, there are some educated people that say the CDC and the health department say in order for us to flatten the curve, that we keep the mask on in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1236)|
| 0:20:50| The challenge for us is not so much that we're trying to eliminate kids of not seeing their lovely smiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1250)|
| 0:20:58| We are one of the only districts in the state of Tennessee that went back to school face-to-face as of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1258)|
| 0:21:07| And so most of the districts that are metropolitan areas across this state have not gone back to school because of masks, not having mask mandates from the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1267)|
| 0:21:19| You have taken a great step of saying that we want kids to be in school, yes, and we also want them to be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1279)|
| 0:21:26| The masks are not only meant for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| They're meant for adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| So I know that most parents believe that kids cannot be carriers of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1290)|
| 0:21:37| But let me tell you, that's a false, that's a false, that's just false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| Because my whole family from a 2-year-old, a 3-year-old, a 10-year-old, a 70-year-old and a 72-year-old had COVID along with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1302)|
| 0:21:52| I'm the one that had it the worst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| But these masks actually help us prevent from the spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| It actually helps our kids not getting it from adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| Now, if you think kids can't get it, why don't you go and check about some of the kids that have been in a hospital, a children's hospital, that are having breathing challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1323)|
| 0:22:11| It's great that we know that cheerleaders can't cheer with these masks on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| You can't even hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| But if I were to take this mask off, which I'm not because there are a lot of parents that are still going around being asymptomatic and carrying this around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1339)|
| 0:22:26| We're just asking as educators, yes, we will enforce this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| We will make sure that your kid is safe of not getting a COVID from an adult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1350)|
| 0:22:36| We just want to make sure that we're flattening the curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| And if they really wanted to help us, they would help try to get us get a vaccine in school for adults and for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1359)|
| 0:22:46| This is not acceptable to think that we don't need masks in schools and we don't need to keep people safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1366)|
| 0:22:53| Just like the NFL, they just had the Super Bowl this past weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| You saw that it was a mandate for coaches and everyone else to wear a mask, even though there were only 7,500 people in the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1377)|
| 0:23:04| They must keep that on because, again, they're trying to flatten the curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| We are just trying to make sure that students are safe in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| And we appreciate your forefront, at least the superintendent's initiative, because he can tell you that we have not agreed that we should be in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1391)|
| 0:23:21| Educators would prefer to be at home instead of being out around the masses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| There are close to 40,000 students that are out in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| We have had more kids that had COVID than there has been educators because of improper use of masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1411)|
| 0:23:39| I understand it's a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| Educators understand it's a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| But we've got to do our jobs to make sure that we're keeping the safety of not only the students, the other students in the school, but the families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1425)|
| 0:23:53| We, as educators, have families, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| And luckily, by some of the things that we have done in this district, not one educator has actually passed away from COVID, from getting COVID in the school system because of some of the things that we have put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1436)|
| 0:24:11| I am grateful for the initiatives that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| Keep this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| This is what we are hoping for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| And we are hoping that the community get behind this vaccine and helping educators get vaccinated, along with students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1457)|
| 0:24:25| Again, we thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| We thank you for looking out for the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| They want to get back to some normalcy, but it can't be normal if we have 450,000 people that to this day have passed away, and we just can't take one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1469)|
| 0:24:39| And so, again, we thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| And we know it's going to be, whatever we've been doing at this point, it's worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| And we ask that you continue that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| I appreciate everybody coming to speak on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| And now, move ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| Thank you, Ms. Fab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| So, basically, I'll open the discussion up if anybody has comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1500)|
| 0:25:07| I would just say, which I'm assuming people do, I would just say that, you know, one of my, I don't think I said this earlier, but one of my concerns is that we're sending a message to the students of the arts that it's okay if sports don't wear their masks, but we think they should have to wear masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1507)|
| 0:25:27| And so, that concerns me that that's not fair to those students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| And so, that's one of the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| And also, the, granted, the, most of the activities right now are indoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1533)|
| 0:25:40| Some of them may be outdoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| So, of course, that could factor in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| But with our teams that have been practicing, we haven't, we've had a few teams over this past school, over the school year that have had situations, but they've really been minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1544)|
| 0:25:53| So, it hasn't been, I don't think we've seen wide outbreaks of COVID from students who are maskless and playing a sport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1553)|
| 0:26:03| So, and I think that probably for things such as band, you know, it's probably easier to stay six feet apart rather than on the basketball court or volleyball court or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1563)|
| 0:26:14| So, anyway, I will go to Ms. Owen first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| Madam Chair, it was my understanding that there were some other people who were speaking on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| So, if we could double check that before we move into our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| And I don't know how to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| Ms. Coatney asked people when they called in, and we've got Mark, the people that talked about masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| So, maybe we should check in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| Do you want me to go out and find out if there's other people that only want to talk on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| Renee, do you mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| Here, do you want the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| Yeah, it has to be somebody on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| I just want to make sure we get everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1609)|
| 0:26:58| And it may be that they said something different, that they were speaking on this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| I believe there were several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| There are a lot of speakers, but they didn't specify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1627)|
| 0:27:18| There might be others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1638)|
| 0:27:26| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| It would certainly be helpful to hear from everybody if we have others who intend to speak about that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| There's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| You can use his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| If you will just state your name and county of residence, and then you have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| Okay, I'm Bradley Pruitt, and I reside in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1665)|
| 0:27:52| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| Thank you for allowing me to speak on behalf of parents and children of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| I graduated from University of Tennessee, Knoxville with a bachelor's degree in biology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| with a concentration in ecology and evolutionary biology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| Some relevant courses I completed were microbiology, ecology, organic chemistry, comparative vertebrate biology, among others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1689)|
| 0:28:19| And I will say that I also was a research assistant in two different labs as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1699)|
| 0:28:25| Throughout the course of my biology studies, the idea of species diversity was stressed as a key function of healthy ecosystems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1705)|
| 0:28:34| We also frequently studied and discussed viruses and how they were here long before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1714)|
| 0:28:42| and will likely be here long after we're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| There is little known about viruses relative to the amount of possible information that viruses contain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1725)|
| 0:28:53| It is debatable whether a virus is a living organism, but there is consensus that they comprise 1-8% of the human genome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1733)|
| 0:29:03| That's our DNA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1743)|
| 0:29:09| That is to say that they were and are a part of our evolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| My point being that viruses, whatever they are, come from nature and their main purposes are seemingly to reproduce and spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1754)|
| 0:29:22| Regarding the effectiveness of masks, in the Danish study titled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| Effectiveness of Adding a Mask Recommendation to Other Public Health Measures to Prevent SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Danish Mask Wearers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1767)|
| 0:29:37| of which 4,862 participants completed the study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| concluded that the recommendation to wear surgical masks to supplement other public health measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1781)|
| 0:29:47| did not reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among wearers by more than 50% in a community with modest infection rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1787)|
| 0:29:56| some degree of social distancing, and uncommon general mask use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1796)|
| 0:30:02| Regarding the effects of masks on children, in the German study titled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1802)|
| 0:30:08| Corona Children's Studies, First Results of a German-wide Registry on Mouth and Nose Covering in Children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1808)|
| 0:30:16| 363 doctors were asked to make entries and inform parents and teachers of existence of the registry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1816)|
| 0:30:24| Children's complaints were reported across 24 distinct symptoms including headaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| concentration difficulties, impairment of learning, drowsiness, shortness of breath, nausea, feeling of weakness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1829)|
| 0:30:38| loss of appetite, tachycardia, ringing ears, fainting, and vomiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1838)|
| 0:30:44| If you want to improve the health of children in our public schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1844)|
| 0:30:51| first you should improve the food served to them by serving organic, locally grown, seasonal foods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1851)|
| 0:30:58| adhering to a balanced diet that are not highly processed foods and do not contain vegetable oils| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1858)|
| 0:31:05| and excessive amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| You should also make masks and contact tracing a parental or guardian choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1869)|
| 0:31:16| You don't protect children by inhibiting their ability to properly and naturally inhale and exhale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1876)|
| 0:31:23| and as I've stated above, you are potentially harming them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| Also, the psychological effects of not being able to see the lower half of the faces of their peers is unknown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1887)|
| 0:31:36| I believe that masks should be voluntary, and contact tracing should only be done to the extent that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1896)|
| 0:31:42| someone is willing to answer questions about their private affairs and personal medical information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| Tennessee is a volunteer state, not a voluntold state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1914)|
| 0:32:12| You were correct, Ms. Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1932)|
| 0:32:23| Okay, Lisa Fontanarosa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1943)|
| 0:32:41| If you'll please state your name and county of residence, and you'll have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| My name is Lisa Fontanarosa, and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| My son is a junior and is in band at Central High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| First, I would like to address the inequitable rules that have been forced upon the arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| You created disparities for students in the arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| Your strategic plan specifically states you will provide students every opportunity to reach their highest potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1980)|
| 0:33:06| Your number two goal is eliminating disparities, and specifically mentions maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1986)|

| 0:33:15| This past summer slash fall, you did not allow wind players, who are the majority of the band, to rehearse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=1995)|
| 0:33:22| band students to perform indoors, our concerts and competitions were canceled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2002)|

| 0:33:32| and they were exiled to the end zone, out on the field, away from everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| You denied our kids so much, and it broke my heart as a mom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| It was unjust, and these kids did not deserve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| We watched our kids watch their peers in football, cheer, and dance participate in very activities they were forbidden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2025)|
| 0:33:53| Our kids were treated as if they were inferior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| They are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| The arts are as important as academics and athletics, and our students also compete for scholarships and some major in music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2038)|
| 0:34:06| You have a duty to ensure that all students have access to a reasonable and fair education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2046)|
| 0:34:12| Excellence for every child requires all students are given opportunities and not denied them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2052)|
| 0:34:19| You cheated our kids, you cheated our parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| Second, I'm going to, well, let me say that it's February, we're still waiting on you to do what's right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2063)|
| 0:34:29| so please do it now so they can salvage some of the spring semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| These kids should have never been treated that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| And now I'll move on to implore you to please look at science and data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| It's there, it's been there before you ever went back to school in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| Stop allowing the Knox County Health Department and the Board of Health to determine what you're doing in our schools with our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2084)|
| 0:34:51| Dr. Buchanan is a family physician who hasn't practiced in quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| Our current health board has no pediatricians, epidemiologists, or infectious disease doctors on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2096)|
| 0:35:03| In June, a local practicing pediatrician, Dr. Rob Scherer, wrote Superintendent Thomas a letter containing solid local and worldwide data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2103)|
| 0:35:13| concerning COVID and the pediatric population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| He stated cloth masks and distancing were completely ridiculous for the pediatric population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2117)|
| 0:35:23| There was no convincing science that cloth masks slow or block the spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| There was zero doubt that inappropriately wearing them increased the risk 100% for children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2127)|
| 0:35:33| He urged you to seek counsel of other area providers and health officials qualified to discuss disease burden in children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2133)|
| 0:35:43| In November, Dr. Joe Childs, Chief Medical Officer for Children's Hospital, stated only 14 children have been hospitalized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2143)|
| 0:35:51| and the majority of those came in for other concerns but were just found to be COVID positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| Only three were admitted because of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| No one under 17 in our county had died from COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| In December, Dr. Childs came back and said children are struggling and have doctors worried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2162)|
| 0:36:07| Emergency room and pediatric providers have seen an uptick of children who need mental or emotional support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| Some have depression, have experienced substance abuse, or suicide attempts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| He stated it was approaching disastrous proportions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| Why haven't you consulted local pediatricians, epidemiologists, and infectious disease physicians?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2182)|
| 0:36:30| Have you talked to providers whose opinions differ from those of Dr. Buchanan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| If not, why? Because you owe our kids that. You owe us parents that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| Kids aren't spreading COVID. We've seen studies from all over the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| Zero deaths in our county under age 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| You still aren't allowing our children to breathe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| You aren't allowing them to live their lives as normal kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| The collateral damage is frightening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| You're robbing them of memories, milestones, valuable time with their peers, and once-in-a-lifetime opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2216)|
| 0:37:02| And it's your job to look out for the children and do what is right by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| And stop this madness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| Wearing masks and social distancing isn't normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| Our kids deserve normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| Our kids deserve in-person education, and they deserve to be treated fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| Thank you. Chad Fontenarosa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2241)|
| 0:37:34| Chad Fontenarosa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2254)|
| 0:37:50| If you'll please state your name, county of residence, and then you'll have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| My name is Chad Fontenarosa. I'm from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| And this fall, the Knox County school system forced my wife and I to make the hardest decision that we've had to make as parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2278)|
| 0:38:07| There was much heartache and sleepless nights as we struggled to decide what to do about our son's education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2287)|
| 0:38:13| In the end, we reluctantly agreed to let our son go back to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| This decision tormented us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| We did not want him wearing a mask all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| We know that's not good for his physical health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| To my knowledge, there's still no direct evidence from studies on COVID-19 that universal masking of healthy people prevents infection from respiratory viruses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2307)|
| 0:38:39| But we do know that there are potential harms and disadvantages, such as self-containment risk from touching one's face mask and then touching one's eyes with contaminated hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2319)|
| 0:38:53| Self-contamination that can occur if non-medical masks are not changed when wet or soiled, as it can create favorable conditions for microorganisms to amplify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2333)|
| 0:39:06| Potential headache or breathing difficulties, difficulty with communicating clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| We also know that being home isolated all day, month after month, was also not good for our son's mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| Our son, who enjoys his home time, begged us to go back to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| He told us he wanted to be with his friends and bandmates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| He said that he didn't want to be home alone all day long doing school on a computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2365)|
| 0:39:32| He said that he was willing to wear the mask if he had to, which was heartbreaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2372)|
| 0:39:41| But we agreed to let him do it because we also know the importance of in-person learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2381)|
| 0:39:47| We know that isolation isn't good for teens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| Suicide is the second leading cause of death and rising among our youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2389)|
| 0:39:55| A recent published study of almost 26,000 kids in Germany revealed that 68% of the parents reported impairments due to their children's cause of wearing a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2395)|
| 0:40:07| Headaches, irritability, nausea, fatigue, loss of concentration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| We believe this because our son has suffered from many of these since returning to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2411)|
| 0:40:18| Next, I would like to say that virtual school is a joke, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2418)|
| 0:40:25| The teachers aren't teaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| They're giving the assignments and calling it a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| The kids are on their own for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| Is this what my tax dollars are paying for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| If so, can I get them back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| Never mind, I already know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2441)|
| 0:40:47| You all know that there are negative impacts on kids when school is closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| Many of the kids come from less than ideal home environments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| For those kids, school is their safe place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| They're a guaranteed meal, a place to feel worthy and loved, and a place where they have peer support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2457)|
| 0:41:03| Our son goes to school with many kids who fit the description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| Last, I would like to address the negative attitudes of many teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2467)|
| 0:41:14| Parents should not have to hear teachers say that they shouldn't have to die to teach our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| And it's been said, and you've seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| Parents shouldn't have to feel guilty because they want their kids to have an in-person education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2483)|
| 0:41:29| It has been very disappointing as a parent to see these attitudes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| We're thankful for those who do not view their jobs this way, but are saddened by those who do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2493)|
| 0:41:41| Teachers with more conservative views are probably, most likely, definitely scared to speak out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2501)|
| 0:41:48| And that's concerning also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| I've been an essential worker this entire time, working in hospitals in three different states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2512)|
| 0:41:59| And speaking with staff, off the record, I've been told that this has been so blown out of proportion, it's crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2519)|
| 0:42:09| Some of us are not paralyzed with the fear of catching COVID, yet we are being forced to conform to those who are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2529)|
| 0:42:16| However, we are frightened by what is happening to our children and by what our school system is doing to our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2536)|
| 0:42:26| You're doing it with our tax dollars and claiming it's in the best interest of the kids. It isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| Quite frankly, in the beginning, we hoped and prayed that all this nonsense would be over in a short time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| But as the time drags on, and our heartbreak has turned to anger with KCS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| because you guys are allowing unelected people who have zero accountability to the residents of this county to call the shots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2563)|
| 0:42:52| And that's not okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| Amber Burns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2577)|
| 0:43:10| Is Amber Burns here? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| If you'll just state your name and county of residence, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| Okay, thank you. I'm Amber Burns. I live here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| Thank you for your time. Thank you for letting us come and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| I just quickly wanted to address a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| I know specifically we're talking about masks for extracurricular activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| There is something called discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| And if we allow one group of people to do something and not another group of people, it's discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| If you look throughout the country, there's actually lawsuits centered around certain discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2617)|
| 0:43:42| And I do feel, I mean, I've seen on social media, band directors talking about it, parents talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2622)|
| 0:43:49| We have to allow these other extracurriculars like band chorus to have the same options as the athletes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2629)|
| 0:43:57| If we don't, I feel like we're going to be in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| And it is always an option to allow certain kids to wear masks if that is what they prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2639)|
| 0:44:06| There's also an option that those kids who feel like for their family they need to wear a mask or distance, they can sit further away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2646)|
| 0:44:13| There are other options. It's not an all or none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| But the point is, we have to treat all kids the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| It has to be in the policy the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| And then there are other options for those families who feel as though it's important for their kids to continue to wear a mask in those extracurricular activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2661)|
| 0:44:28| So that should be open to the families and the parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| Also, just quickly wanted to address, we were discussing earlier, it was discussed earlier about kids having COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2671)|
| 0:44:38| That is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| There's lots of studies that show, which I have shared with you guys, and it's up to you whether you read them or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2680)|
| 0:44:45| There's also lots of studies that show kids are getting COVID from community spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| There is lots of evidence that shows in school with safety protocols, distancing, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| in small cohorts of kids all together that are staying together, very low spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2697)|
| 0:45:03| There was a study that was out of North Carolina in Charleston, which I emailed everyone a while back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2703)|
| 0:45:13| There was no case spread found from a child to a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| And I would also say this, there is an option for our teachers for extra safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2717)|
| 0:45:23| It was brought up in November to Dr. Buchanan, the possibility of wearing N95 masks, and she said that it wasn't feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2723)|
| 0:45:29| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| There are a lot of personnel who are wearing N95 masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| Our older population, they're wearing N95 masks if they feel it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| That is the only mask that has proven to be effective for reducing transmission of COVID, and that's across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2739)|
| 0:45:48| Our teachers have that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| They can wear N95 masks, and that would be their protection, regardless of what we do moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| Also, it was talked about with kids in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| Lisa has already addressed, or kids in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| Lisa has already mentioned this earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| There are 23 cases right now of kids who have been in the hospital in ages 0 through 17 who have tested positive for COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2763)|
| 0:46:11| Most of those did not go in for COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| They were tested positive while they were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| It was also mentioned that educators would prefer not to be in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| I find that that's very untrue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| I have lots of educators that are reaching out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| They're concerned about our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| They want to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| They want to be in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| I would also mention, talk to your pharmacists, your nurses, your policemen, your mailman, your OB providers, your ultrasound techs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2790)|
| 0:46:38| Those people are doing their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| Can you imagine a woman who's pregnant calling the OB and saying, I want to get an ultrasound to look at my child, and they're saying, I'm sorry, we don't prefer to be there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2800)|
| 0:46:48| We're worried about COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| Can you imagine if your mailman was worried about COVID exposure, and he said, I'm not delivering any more mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2810)|
| 0:46:56| I don't care that it's Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| I don't care that it's packages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| Can you imagine if all the policemen said, look, I'm not going to work today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| I'm worried about COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| All the medical professionals, all the nurses, you couldn't go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| If you were sick, there would be no one to treat you because they were all worried about COVID, and they all decided to stay home that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| They didn't want to do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| Guys, this is essential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| I'm begging that we look past where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| Look past the fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| Look past everything that's being bombarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| We have to look to the future for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| If we don't look forward, we're going to miss it, and we're going to look back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| Hindsight, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| Please, let's not get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| We don't want to look back and go, oh, gosh, we could have done something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| Our kids have to have things change for them to move forward in their futures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2856)|
| 0:47:42| People are dying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| People are dying all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| People are dying from lots of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| People are dying from COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| Our kids are not dying from COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| We've had at least a couple of cases of suicide, and they are saying nationwide that's related to lockdown and school closures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2871)|
| 0:47:59| We've had some in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| Please, let's look forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| Let's make changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| COVID is not going away quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| Vaccines are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| It's not going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| We have to make a difference, or two years down the road, we're going to look back and go, gosh, I wish we had changed some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2889)|
| 0:48:15| Thanks for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| Angie Goethert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2899)|
| 0:48:45| Angie Goethert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| Angie, could you please state your name and county of residence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| Yes, my name is Angie Goethert, and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2928)|
| 0:48:54| Thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| When I plan to e-mail, call, or speak to you, I work hard to include data and studies to allow you to make an informed decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2937)|
| 0:49:04| Renee has a packet for each of you that she's going to give you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2944)|
| 0:49:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| Yeah, they can take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2951)|
| 0:49:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| There will be very little of the data and studies tonight, as this will be a much more personal after the day our family had yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2959)|
| 0:49:27| At around 935 a.m. yesterday, I got a text from our daughter saying that she felt funny and that she wasn't sure what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2967)|
| 0:49:36| I tried to get her to answer some questions, but she was having real trouble doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2976)|
| 0:49:41| I gave her a couple of minutes to try to calm down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| The next text said, Mom, I'm scared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| For any parent, that is the one thing that when any of our children say that, we drop whatever we're doing and we get to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2987)|
| 0:49:54| So I headed to HVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| Once I was in the car, I called the front desk and asked them to get Christina to the nurse and that I was on my way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=2996)|
| 0:50:02| Of course, they assured me they would do just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| I knew that they would, and I was not prepared for what I would see when I got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| I was in the office, and the woman at the front desk called the nurse and let them know I was there to pick her up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| Christina was being carried to the office by the nurse and her first block teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3014)|
| 0:50:19| Her color was not good, and she was moving very slowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| They both offered to help me get her to the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| When we got outside, I thanked them for making sure she was okay and told them we would let them know how things were going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3025)|
| 0:50:31| The tears fell from my eyes, and I'm not sure when they stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| We made it to Children's to the ER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| She was having a lot of trouble breathing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| Even though she was having real shortness of breath, there was no real hurry to get her back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3040)|
| 0:50:45| We sat in the lobby waiting room for an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| All the while, our 16-year-old girl was holding onto me so tightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| I was able to get her to slow her breathing, and she fell asleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| I took a deep breath for the first time in two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| Christina and I went back to the room where they ran a number of tests, x-rays, and ultrasounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| A respiratory therapist came in and gave her a breathing treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| She was still so weak, and it was so hard to see her that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| After a few hours, they brought her a steroid, and about a half an hour after that, her color started to return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3069)|
| 0:51:15| Again, I took a deep breath, and I knew she would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| With her breathing under control and our sweet girl really starting to come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| the nurse practitioner walked in and told us that they would like to test her for COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| I watched as our girl started to sob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| The tears began to flow for me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| In talking to the nurse practitioner, Christina told her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| if I test positive, my friends and teachers will have to quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| I can't do that to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| If they miss school, they will fall farther behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| They will miss seeing their friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| They'll be stuck at home alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| Our girl was so concerned for what the cost of a positive test would be to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| She didn't want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| I was heartbroken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| What are we doing to our children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| Our children are so worried what a positive result of a medical test will do to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| They are afraid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| Her test was negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| We have to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| The good news is that Christina went back to school today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| She's been instructed to use her new inhaler every four hours and to drink as much water as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| She also was told to take a break from wearing her mask whenever she can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3137)|
| 0:52:22| She was also instructed to never wear a mask when doing any physical activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3142)|
| 0:52:28| Do we think she'll do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| She does not want anyone to yell at her, so here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| 3-21-2020 is the day that we started 15 days to slow the spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| The last day of school last year was 3-12-2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| Stay home to save the health care system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| July was the start of the eight-week mask mandate of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3166)|
| 0:52:51| to fall over restrictions and mandates that are too numerous to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3171)|
| 0:52:56| Yet everyone that has been tried, the virus has gone up and down during respiratory season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3176)|
| 0:53:01| no matter what has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| Our health department has admitted they do not track the statistics of schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| yet they put their opinion everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| We have to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| We elected you to stand for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| Many of us never gave a second thought to who we voted for or what they stood for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3195)|
| 0:53:20| Now we know it matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| Ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| Do not sit back waiting to be told what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| You have the power to make change happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| This is what we elected you to do, and we have to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| I want to leave you with a story that many of you may have heard growing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| Noah built the ark as God instructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| He loaded it as God also instructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| As those people that did not get on the ark, they began to walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| and they held their children on their hips as they walked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| As the water rose, they put their children on their shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| I'm sorry, I'm going to have to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| I know, but I passed out my packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| I have five more words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| Five more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| Okay, just stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| As the water rose, they put their children on their shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| The water got higher and higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| At that point, the people put the children under their feet to try to save themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| Please hold our children higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| We have Deaver Shattuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3254)|
| 0:54:38| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3278)|
| 0:54:39| Please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| My name is Deaver Shattuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3280)|
| 0:54:41| I'm a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| I have to say I'd rather be anywhere in Knox County tonight but here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| I don't like to speak publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| I get stage fright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| My voice will break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| I'm calm in front of patients, but not in front of a group like this, so I apologize ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| But my wife told me that there was a group coming to advocate against masking in our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| and I just felt I should bring some science to the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| I know there is a motion that is very, very high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| I share it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| I'm fearful of COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| I'm fearful for my kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3312)|
| 0:55:13| I have school-age kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| I have a daughter who teaches at Vine Middle School, so I understand the fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| I came a little bit late today because I am a practicing physician and came here straight from the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3321)|
| 0:55:27| I work as a hospital physician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| I'm on my hospital's COVID task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| In my community, I'm recognized as a COVID expert in prevention and treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| I have taken care of scores, if not hundreds, of COVID patients at my hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| and have been with many of them as they've died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| This is life and death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| It's not a hoax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| It's real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| So, y'all, first of all, have done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3349)|
| 0:55:54| Y'all kept our schools open safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| As has been said here correctly, we've not had an explosion of COVID cases amongst our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3356)|
| 0:56:02| That's because y'all keep them masked in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| That is a fantastic job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| Keeping our kids safe, which is your first responsibility, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| I hope y'all have the courage to follow the science and not the emotion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| and keep our kids masked and safe in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| That's how we're going to keep our schools open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| If you pull back on the masking, especially in events like singing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3382)|
| 0:56:27| singing is one of our most dangerous events to spread the disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| So it's critical that we mask or don't sing at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| That's a super spreader event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| I've heard some speakers say here that masking has not been proven to be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| That's patently false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| Masking is our most effective means of preventing this disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3404)|
| 0:56:50| If you doubt it, just ask yourself, what happened to flu season this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3410)|
| 0:56:56| We didn't have flu season this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| We didn't have flu season this year because we were masked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| COVID is much more contagious, much more transmissible than the flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3422)|
| 0:57:07| So with masking, no flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| Masking works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| The science is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| The CDC is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| Follow the science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| Please do not follow emotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| Keep our kids safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| Joy Eubanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3445)|
| 0:57:45| Yes, if you could please state your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| then you'll have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| My name is Joy Eubanks and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| I will be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| I would love to say I would love to see the mask mandate in schools go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| But if we were to continue with the mask mandates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| then is there another way that we can adjust the school schedules to create a staggered weekly schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3482)|
| 0:58:08| to allow distancing in the classrooms so that our children will not be required to wear masks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3488)|
| 0:58:14| At the very least, could there be some way that we could survey the parents to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| would you like your child to wear a mask or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| And then separate the classrooms to accommodate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| Wear the masks in the hallways, but not in the classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| to give the children the freedom they need to breathe and to be social.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3505)|
| 0:58:30| Our children are wearing masks in gym class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| They're running around with masks on in gym class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| My son would rather not wear a mask, but he does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| and he doesn't complain because he's not a troublemaker and he doesn't want to complain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| But I want to be his voice because it's not okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| It's not okay to have our children running around in gym class with their face and their nose covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3527)|
| 0:58:53| It's hard enough to breathe in these masks and they have to wear them seven hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| And then they go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| I mean, why even have gym?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3538)|
| 0:58:59| Maybe just have them sit and do a test or do something other than running around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| My children need activity and all my children are athletes and my children play sports and they play sports without masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3544)|
| 0:59:11| But yet they are required to wear them in gym class at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| It doesn't make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| Last June, the WHO, the World Health Organization, did state that it was very rare to track the transmission of asymptomatic people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3557)|
| 0:59:27| But yet we continue to say that everybody is sick all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3567)|
| 0:59:34| And studies have shown that the virus droplets are not contained in the cloth masks because the droplets are much smaller than the holes in the masks and therefore ineffective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3574)|
| 0:59:43| If the mask works and we are just trying to flatten the curve, like everyone says, then why have we not achieved this by now with these masks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3583)|
| 0:59:50| Everywhere I look, everybody wears a mask all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| You never see emotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| You never see a smile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3594)|
| 0:59:55| You never can walk by anybody in the grocery store anymore because everybody is afraid to talk to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3595)|
| 1:00:01| It's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| It's too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| Now Fauci is saying we should be wearing two or three masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| Is that because the masks don't work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| It's ridiculous and it's too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| Our children need to see faces and they need to not feel alone in a room full of people because they are told to social distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3616)|
| 1:00:24| We have elementary school children who need to see their teacher's faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| They need to see other children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| They need to be affirmed and smiled at and touched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| I have an eight-year-old who needs affirmation, not just from six feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3631)|
| 1:00:38| He needs to be able to play with his friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| I really feel like there can be, if there are people, I don't feel like that we're going to be able to come together and agree on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3641)|
| 1:00:49| But if there was some way that we could come to a compromise and say, look, this group of people, your parents want you to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| You're going to have to go in that room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| And then people whose parents don't care if they wear a mask, if they're not afraid for their children, then they can be in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3657)|
| 1:01:05| And then you can separate them like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| And then those people can be in the room with the mask on and with the teacher who feels like she needs to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3667)|
| 1:01:13| And then this room could maybe have a teacher who is six feet away and we could social distance everyone, but yet they don't have to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3673)|
| 1:01:20| So I just feel like there should be some type of thoughtful compromise with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| And then if we have to wear a mask in the hallway, then so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| But I don't feel like across the board that everybody has the highest concerns that everyone else does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3688)|
| 1:01:33| And I do not know why, as a society and a community, that everybody has to bow down to everyone else who feels like they are just so afraid of something that has been shown that our fatalities have immensely decreased, even though the cases continue to rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3693)|
| 1:01:48| So that's just how I feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| Sarah Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3715)|
| 1:02:09| Is Sarah Wilson here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3729)|
| 1:02:17| Hi, if you'll just state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3737)|
| 1:02:21| Who's talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| My name is Sarah Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| I'm from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| I'm going to speak really fast because I know we have five minutes and I've got a lot to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3747)|
| 1:02:32| I come before you, a mother of two children, one daughter that is a sophomore and a son that is in second grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3752)|
| 1:02:39| I want to take this opportunity to say that we're failing our children in their education needs right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3759)|
| 1:02:46| The restrictions that are being imposed on our schools right now are making it near impossible for our children to learn effectively and for our teachers to teach efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3766)|
| 1:02:54| I'd like to give you the very personal perspectives of both of my children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| First off, my son is eight years old in second grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| He has auditory processing disorder, which is when the brain has trouble processing and deciphering speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3780)|
| 1:03:08| As you can imagine, for a child that is already incredibly challenged with understanding speech and speech sounds, how much more this is exacerbated by a teacher that has to teach through a mask all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3788)|
| 1:03:17| We're failing our special needs kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3797)|
| 1:03:21| As of this year, my son every single day tells me he hates school emphatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3801)|
| 1:03:27| We asked him why he hates school so much this year and his answer is because there are so many rules now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| Don't touch the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3812)|
| 1:03:33| Stay six feet apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3813)|
| 1:03:34| Pull your mask up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3814)|
| 1:03:35| Don't touch your friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| We have taken every single fun thing out of school and it is now eerily similar to a detention center based on the way he describes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3817)|
| 1:03:44| The early years of education are crucial and it's important that our kids fall in love with learning, yet we are taking away everything that they actually love about school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3824)|
| 1:03:54| I recently read a publication by Dr. Mark McDonald, a board certified psychiatric in both child and adolescent and adult psychiatry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3834)|
| 1:04:06| Here are some excerpts from his publication in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| The true public health crisis lies in the widespread fear which morphed and evolved into a form of mass delusional psychosis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3849)|
| 1:04:16| In simpler words, the American public is suffering from mass insanity due to their delusional fear of COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3856)|
| 1:04:23| Even when the statistics point to extremely low fatality rate among children and young adults, measuring .002% at age 10 and .01% at age 25,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3863)|
| 1:04:33| the young and the healthy are still terrorized by the chokehold of irrational fear when faced with the coronavirus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3873)|
| 1:04:40| He goes on to say, perhaps the most important point is the lasting effect this mass paranoia will have on our future generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3880)|
| 1:04:47| I have witnessed the highest increase ever of psychiatric issues among my young patients since the lockdowns and closures started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3887)|
| 1:04:54| They've suffered more than in my entire career in private practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| This generation is basically not only being traumatized, but also being taught to accept the feeling of unjustified guilt about themselves just for being children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3898)|
| 1:05:08| I ask you, with study after study showing that children are very unlikely to catch or spread COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3908)|
| 1:05:14| why are we punishing them for breathing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| Why are we punishing them for being kids and wanting to play with their friends, for wanting to hug their teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| Why are they not going on field trips and class parties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| Their childhood is slipping away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| We don't get second grade back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| We don't get any of these grades back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| We're failing our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| Both of my children are greatly emotionally and physically affected by wearing a mask every day for hours on end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| There are zero studies showing there are zero studies to show that long term mask usage is OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3938)|
| 1:05:43| Zero studies showing it is not detrimental to our health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3946)|
| 1:05:47| So why are our children the lab rats?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| Why are we experimenting on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| In December, just two months ago, the World Health Organization published published guidance on mask usage in the context of COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3951)|
| 1:05:59| And I would encourage the physician that spoke earlier to read this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| This is from the World Health Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| He said there's no evidence, but based on them, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3964)|
| 1:06:08| I would like to read for you verbatim the exact words from this guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| At present, there is only limited and inconsistent scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of masking healthy people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3972)|
| 1:06:20| in the community to prevent infection with respiratory virus, including the SARS-CoV-2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3980)|
| 1:06:24| a large, randomized, community-based trial in which 4,862 healthy participants were divided into a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3984)|
| 1:06:30| wearing surgical masks, and a control group found no difference in infection with SARS-CoV-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3990)|
| 1:06:36| I would be happy to share the link of this study with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| As for my daughter, she is 16 and a sophomore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| As I was preparing to come before you, I sat down and had an honest conversation with her about struggles she has had this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4003)|
| 1:06:48| She is a very bright, honored student who literally lives and breathes for music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| Her dream is to attend Juilliard when she graduates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| She signed up this year for every musical class available to her, band, ensemble, music theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4014)|
| 1:06:59| Music is her outlet, her brain break, her release from anxiety and stress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| which we all know has been in great abundance this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| However, the precautions put in place not once in the school year has she been able to touch her instrument in band.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4025)|
| 1:07:14| Her teacher feels it isn't safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| Since it's gotten cold, not once has she been able to sing in ensemble because they can't go outside to sing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4036)|
| 1:07:21| They're not allowed to sing indoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4041)|
| 1:07:22| Not once this school year has she been able to be a part in a musical theater play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| I have a lot more to say about contact tracing, but I'll sum it up as in the masking for our healthy children, this is ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4047)|
| 1:07:36| I didn't even get to the contact tracing part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| She just recently had an experience with contact tracing, and it was absolutely ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| When she was quarantined, she was ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| It's totally ineffective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4067)|
| 1:07:55| Let me just double check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| Yes, we have. I believe we have gotten everyone that wanted to speak on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| Oh, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4087)|
| 1:08:35| If you're here to talk about masks, then go ahead and talk now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| OK, there's just been a little bit confusion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| So is she on the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| Did she sign up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| Yes, she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| She has signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| I just didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4128)|
| 1:08:49| If you're speaking directly to our mask policy that we're going to talk about, then go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| Hi, my name is Laura Branson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| First, before I start, I wanted to address what the gentleman said earlier about not using emotion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4136)|
| 1:09:03| Is emotion not part of our mental health, and is mental health not something we are responsible as teachers and administrators and parents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4143)|
| 1:09:11| So don't tell me not to have emotion about what we as parents and our kids are going through at school right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4151)|
| 1:09:18| God sent us here with three very important things, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| That is life, liberty, and common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| With the rise of tech so readily available to us all the time, 24-7, we've got our phones and our computers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4166)|
| 1:09:32| our TV, we have information blaring at us all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4172)|
| 1:09:36| We have statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4176)|
| 1:09:37| Right now we have science that is contradicting itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| One of us is going to tell you that we've seen science and we've heard doctors and professionals tell us that masks don't work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4181)|
| 1:09:48| that they make things worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| Then we have people telling us that they do work and that they do have proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| However, there is one thing that is very, very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| These masks are stripping us of our common sense and our liberty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4198)|
| 1:10:03| When COVID first became headline news, I really and truly thought it was just going to blow over like every other health scare we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4203)|
| 1:10:10| But it didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4210)|
| 1:10:11| We were forced to close our schools, told we could not go and worship in our churches, that we had to close non-essential businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4211)|
| 1:10:19| I'm not quite sure why they thought that Home Depot was so dang essential versus someone's business that keeps their family eating and alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4219)|
| 1:10:28| And we were forced to start wearing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4228)|
| 1:10:33| We have given up our common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| We are losing our liberties when we give up our common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| And if we don't start using our common sense right now and teaching our children to use their common sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4240)|
| 1:10:45| they're very quickly not even going to understand what liberty is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4245)|
| 1:10:50| We're coming up on a year since all of this started, an entire year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| And we, since we began feeling the impact of this over-politicized event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| Very early on, we found out that there is a 99.7% chance of survival from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4259)|
| 1:11:08| And I believe it even goes up higher from there for children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| We also know now that there are medical remedies and medicines that help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4271)|
| 1:11:18| And doctors who tried to present these facts to us months ago were told to be quiet and they were quickly removed from public sight because of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4278)|
| 1:11:27| I think it should become, it has become obvious to everyone that it's not dangerous to be living our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4287)|
| 1:11:36| We have got to get back to normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| We have to be able to go out and function again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| Where's the end game?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| Where is the end game?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| I've known many people who've had COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| Guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| They got better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| I also know people who have lost someone from COVID-19, but it's because they had an underlying health condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4313)|
| 1:12:01| This isn't uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| My mother passed away from contracting pneumonia in the hospital when she was there for knee surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4323)|
| 1:12:10| I didn't feel entitled to go around telling everyone to stay home and mask up and stay six feet away from me because I was afraid of dying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4330)|
| 1:12:18| This happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| There is nothing different about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| And we know that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4342)|
| 1:12:26| I received a phone call last week that my son had potentially been exposed to someone with COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4346)|
| 1:12:33| That phone call came five days after I was told that he came in contact with someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4353)|
| 1:12:40| I also received a second call the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4360)|
| 1:12:44| So five plus one, that's six days later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| What is the point of him being quarantined, therefore, until the 9th, which was yesterday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4367)|
| 1:12:54| What was the point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| If he had been in contact, if we are so worried that he was going to spread this or make other people sick or that he even had it, why was I not called right away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4375)|
| 1:13:05| It doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| I mean, is common sense being used in this contact tracing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4387)|
| 1:13:11| It doesn't seem like it is to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| My son never got sick, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| He should have been in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| I can use common sense and know that I need to keep my child at home if he is sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4397)|
| 1:13:22| I checked today, and it looks like we had 170 total cases of COVID in the county between students and teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4402)|
| 1:13:29| It was the combined number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| 1,663 students and teachers weren't at school today because of 170.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4411)|
| 1:13:40| What kind of a ratio is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| It doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4422)|
| 1:13:43| Again, it doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| My point is, overall, we've survived all these years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| Just as another gentleman spoke earlier, viruses have been around a lot longer than we have, and they're going to be around forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4428)|
| 1:13:54| We get sick all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| People get sick, but people get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4436)|
| 1:13:58| We have got to start using our common sense, take the masks off the kids, and keep them in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4438)|
| 1:14:04| Thank you for coming to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| Thank you very much for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| Now, I believe we can have our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| Thank you, Ms. Babb, for managing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| So, anyone have any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4456)|
| 1:14:22| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| In recent meetings, I have not had a lot to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4466)|
| 1:14:34| But I have a whole lot to say tonight, so I'll apologize in advance for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4474)|
| 1:14:40| The last-minute additions that we've had, those create problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4480)|
| 1:14:44| They create problems with transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| They create problems with trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| When the public can't tell what our intent is, they have to make something up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4489)|
| 1:14:55| They have to assume what our intent is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| They have to guess at what we plan to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| Sometimes they guess wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| Sometimes they guess correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| But the bottom line is, if we are putting things on the agenda without clarity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4506)|
| 1:15:12| so that the public knows what to expect in this meeting, that's our fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4512)|
| 1:15:18| It's not the public's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4518)|
| 1:15:24| Making major policy decisions that impact our curriculum as our year is going on is concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4524)|
| 1:15:33| Doing so in the middle of the second semester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| I don't even understand why we would consider making a major policy change that impacts curriculum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4538)|
| 1:15:45| that impacts everything going on in our schools, in the middle of the second semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4545)|
| 1:15:51| Decisions have been made about whether to go back to in-person or not based on those policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4551)|
| 1:15:59| Whether we agree or disagree with what we've heard tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4559)|
| 1:16:05| something that is especially concerning to me is that this policy that directly impacts our arts curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4565)|
| 1:16:15| came to our agenda very, very late and with no input from our arts teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4575)|
| 1:16:23| The fact that our arts teachers have not had an opportunity to tell us whether they even want to see a change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4583)|
| 1:16:34| that's incredibly concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4594)|
| 1:16:38| I can't imagine why a board would make changes to specific curriculum expectations without even talking to those teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4598)|
| 1:16:51| So today, I was able to contact a range of teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4611)|
| 1:16:58| They are band teachers, orchestra teachers, chorus teachers, general music teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4618)|
| 1:17:04| It's a random sampling and comes out to almost 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4624)|
| 1:17:10| And of these 10% of our teachers that I talked to, none of them want a change to the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4630)|
| 1:17:18| They feel that the policy is working well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| They feel that the policy has enough flexibility to allow their administration to make changes when those are necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4641)|
| 1:17:33| They believe that the policy is working in their classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| And as I talked to these folks, I also gathered some of the things that they were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4657)|
| 1:17:44| One was very concerned that we haven't looked at what UT or the Knoxville Symphony are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4664)|
| 1:17:52| Those are professional musicians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| They are professional musicians who are masking when they are not playing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4675)|
| 1:18:00| unless they are playing a non-wind instrument, in which case they are masked the whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| If they are playing a wind instrument, they have bell covers so that as they blow through their instrument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4685)|
| 1:18:10| all of that aerosol is caught at the end and not spread throughout the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4690)|
| 1:18:15| So it's basically a mask for the end of their instrument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4695)|
| 1:18:19| This is the same thing our bands have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| One of our band directors asked me, if we are going to change this policy now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4704)|
| 1:18:28| why did I spend thousands of dollars on bell covers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| We've also heard some information tonight that is directly wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| It is not true that wind players were not allowed to play in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4716)|
| 1:18:42| They played.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| They played at games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4724)|
| 1:18:45| They played at many events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| They were very carefully distanced, and they were masked when they were not playing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4727)|
| 1:18:55| And I also double-checked that with the principal of the school during this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4735)|
| 1:18:59| and he says, yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| They were playing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| One of our band and orchestra teachers said, I can't believe this is even up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4744)|
| 1:19:09| There is no way I would consider having one of my bands play unmasked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4749)|
| 1:19:14| This isn't safe for students, staff, or audience members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4754)|
| 1:19:18| At this point, I wouldn't even consider doing a performance with an audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4758)|
| 1:19:22| unless we were outside, physically distanced, and wearing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4762)|
| 1:19:28| Another band director said masks are necessary for maintaining the health and safety of the students and the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4768)|
| 1:19:35| Band directors have invested thousands of dollars in bell covers for student instruments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| and they want them to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| A chorus director said, I currently have two separate classes of 44 students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| each that can only space out about two feet apart due to the dimensions of my room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| The Colorado aerosol study states that masks are important to be worn while singing or playing instruments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4792)|
| 1:19:59| to reduce the spread of droplets that could contain COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4799)|
| 1:20:03| We need to be able to keep ourselves and students safe by continuing to wear masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4803)|
| 1:20:08| until vaccines have been provided to the majority of the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4808)|
| 1:20:13| Another chorus director said, there are anywhere between 25 and 70 students in the room at any time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4813)|
| 1:20:19| six classes per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| During rehearsal, students are performing deep breathing exercises as well as singing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4821)|
| 1:20:26| for large amounts of time in rather close proximity to each other in an enclosed space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| Although the mask is inconvenient and sometimes uncomfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4830)|
| 1:20:34| it is a necessity, and that's in all capital letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| For the current pandemic in which we operate and teach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| students cannot safely and responsibly participate in choral or instrumental rehearsal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| and performance without masks until we reach such a time that the pandemic is more under control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4845)|
| 1:20:51| and COVID-19 is no longer as pervasive and risky as in its current state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4851)|
| 1:20:57| A general music elementary teacher said, there is an abundance of evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4857)|
| 1:21:02| showing how COVID spreads through aerosol particles projected during singing and playing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4862)|
| 1:21:07| If the kids aren't wearing masks, they and their teachers will be incredibly vulnerable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4867)|
| 1:21:14| We have been flexible and innovative this year in finding safe ways to play and sing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4874)|
| 1:21:19| We are making it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| Please leave the mask mandate in place through May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| And this is a compilation from one school, the chorus, and two band directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4885)|
| 1:21:31| We believe that masks should absolutely be worn while singing and playing instruments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4891)|
| 1:21:36| We firmly believe that masking and bell covers are the sole precaution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4896)|
| 1:21:40| that has protected us from contracting COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| We feel that many more students would have tested positive without masking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| Today, because of extra care taken to follow precautionary guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| we have not had any outbreaks of large or large quarantine groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| related directly to the performing arts in our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| We are concerned about the health of our students and their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| It would very much be a mistake to remove masking and bell cover requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4923)|
| 1:22:07| for the performing arts at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| Two other band directors at one of our high schools said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| for them, no masks equal no band.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4935)|
| 1:22:19| They do not want to perform without a mask requirement in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| They do not want that change at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| This is just 10%, and a very random 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4949)|
| 1:22:35| It's just people I could get to just today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| I know that there has been a larger survey taken by our music supervisor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4960)|
| 1:22:48| that has not yet been presented to us, unless it may be in our email right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4968)|
| 1:22:53| In that survey, I also know that they don't want this changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4973)|
| 1:22:59| Why are we bringing a change to our classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4979)|
| 1:23:04| that our teachers not only haven't asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4984)|
| 1:23:09| but are opposed to, adamantly opposed to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4989)|
| 1:23:14| There is no reason to make these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| There is no reason to make them in the middle of the second semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=4997)|
| 1:23:29| I also want to point out some incorrect factual information that we've heard tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5009)|
| 1:23:36| Yes, the World Health Organization at one point did say that there was no reason to have masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5016)|
| 1:23:43| That information has completely changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| As we've heard tonight, information changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| The science changes as we learn more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| If you go to the World Health Organization website right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| you are not going to find the recommendation to not mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5036)|
| 1:24:01| It's the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5041)|
| 1:24:08| It's been pointed out that kids are getting COVID in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| because mask requirements aren't being followed in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5052)|
| 1:24:16| They're following them in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| And spread is low in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| It's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| Masking is doing exactly what it is supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5064)|
| 1:24:28| Why would we change something that is working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5068)|
| 1:24:37| One of the studies we heard tonight was from October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5077)|
| 1:24:41| And again, information changes over time as more research is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5081)|
| 1:24:46| And we know that by the time research is published, it's already old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| That research we heard about children not contracting it and spreading it as often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5090)|
| 1:24:56| that was from October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| This one is from November 12th, one month later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5098)|
| 1:25:03| Re-evaluating the children's role in the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5103)|
| 1:25:08| A large study from Austria shows that SARS-CoV-2 affects just as many school children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5108)|
| 1:25:14| as it does teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| While young children may show no symptoms, they are quite efficient at spreading the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5117)|
| 1:25:27| Researchers and epidemiologists have long underestimated the role played by children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| in the spread of the novel coronavirus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| One reason is that they rarely display any symptoms and are thus tested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5135)|
| 1:25:40| much less often than adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| The last thing I want to leave you with is that one of the studies we heard tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5143)|
| 1:25:52| it's very important that you look at all of the words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| The study we heard tonight said that adding masks did not reduce incidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5157)|
| 1:26:03| by more than 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| It didn't say masks did not reduce the incidence of coronavirus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5165)|
| 1:26:12| It said they didn't reduce by more than 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5172)|
| 1:26:19| That's significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| If we are reducing by any percent at all, the possibility that we are going to have families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5181)|
| 1:26:31| in our community suffering death, why on earth would we change what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5191)|
| 1:26:39| I know I said that was the last thing, but that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5199)|
| 1:26:43| We also keep hearing that one percent, it's just one percent, it's less than one percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5203)|
| 1:26:49| Okay, first, any death is terrible and reducing it to a one percent is just sickening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5209)|
| 1:26:59| But it's not even one percent, it's three percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5219)|
| 1:27:03| Of those who have had outcome, that means they have either recovered or died,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5223)|
| 1:27:09| three percent have died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| We are currently approaching half a million people in the U.S. who have died of coronavirus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5232)|
| 1:27:19| We are at nearly 11,000 in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5239)|
| 1:27:24| If we can prevent one, why wouldn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5244)|
| 1:27:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| I am, too, a little frustrated at the late notice in which this policy was added for review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5255)|
| 1:27:40| especially given that the communication that we received about this policy was different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5260)|
| 1:27:45| than what was quoted in one of our local news publications in terms of why it was being brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5265)|
| 1:27:50| from a school board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| I hate that I even have to bring this up publicly, but it's the only forum we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5272)|
| 1:27:55| And so there was some differences in terms, it was slight, but it was important in terms of the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5275)|
| 1:28:02| that was quoted in that news source related to why we were receiving this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5282)|
| 1:28:08| I cannot wait until the time that I have a bonfire in the back of my field with every mask I've ever bought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5288)|
| 1:28:16| I mean, I am down with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| We can come and we can party, and we don't have to distance, and we can do the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5298)|
| 1:28:23| I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5303)|
| 1:28:24| It is old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5304)|
| 1:28:25| It is tiresome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5305)|
| 1:28:26| I have a fairly small staff at the organization that I work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| We just have eight people on our team, and we're typically in one wing of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| but we are spread out across the whole building, and we are masked when we're with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5313)|
| 1:28:38| And I hate that for now a year I've not gotten to see their faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5318)|
| 1:28:42| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5322)|
| 1:28:43| And so I decided it was important to take a little tour of Knoxville, too, this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| So I started my day talking with Dr. Joe Childs at 730 this morning, the chief medical officer at Children's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5327)|
| 1:28:54| So I'm going to just run through some of the things that I heard as I talked to lots of different people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5334)|
| 1:28:58| out in the community, and then I want to also read something to you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5338)|
| 1:29:01| So I don't know what emails I got in the last two hours, but starting last night about 7 o'clock, I got 37 emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5341)|
| 1:29:09| Most of them were from parents and educators, 35 of them were against any change in this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5349)|
| 1:29:16| Two of them were for and actually felt like we should strip masks completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5356)|
| 1:29:21| So I started my morning at 730 talking to Dr. Childs from Children's, who was also referenced tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5361)|
| 1:29:30| Here's some of the things that he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5370)|
| 1:29:31| He said, look, and also approached it this way with everybody that I talked to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| I said, I'm not going to tell you what I'm thinking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| I want to tell you the situation and tell me how you would respond, given your context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5377)|
| 1:29:41| He said, one, we have a lot to be hopeful about, and that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5381)|
| 1:29:44| You know, we have vaccines that are on the way, and we have, especially in Knox County schools, he referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5384)|
| 1:29:51| He said, you all have done a very good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| He said, you've been able to do some things in education that nobody else in the state has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5393)|
| 1:29:58| because of the precautions that we've taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| He also lifted up his concern around some variant strains out of Brazil, South Africa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5400)|
| 1:30:05| which he felt both those were the scarier ones, that those might be four times as infectious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5405)|
| 1:30:10| and he also talked about the U.K. strain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| He said, all three of those strains are present in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| Some of them are in surrounding states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| We know that the U.K. strain is already in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5417)|
| 1:30:20| He spoke specifically about fine arts and the sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5420)|
| 1:30:26| He talked about the practicality of being able to wear a mask while you're playing basketball and or football,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5426)|
| 1:30:32| and maybe that's one of the reasons that that has not happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| But he also said that specifically in the fine arts, when there's forced air,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5437)|
| 1:30:42| he said, you have to understand that six feet of distance is really like in normal everyday living situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5442)|
| 1:30:48| like when we're just in a room having a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5448)|
| 1:30:50| He said, really, with forced air, it should be more like 10 or 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5450)|
| 1:30:54| He said that this is not the time to reduce our mitigation measures against risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5454)|
| 1:31:02| He said, right now, although, yes, it's been looking good here recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5462)|
| 1:31:09| he said, right now, this week, we have more kids and children with COVID than we've had at any other time right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5469)|
| 1:31:16| So I also spoke with Catherine at the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5476)|
| 1:31:19| I also think it isn't, I think it's because of the limited amount of time we had to prepare for this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5479)|
| 1:31:25| I appreciate everybody that came from public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| but the fact that we have no medical professionals that we invited to advise the board is also concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5488)|
| 1:31:33| So I talked to Catherine at the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| She said that there is no data that shows kids locally do not contract COVID on the court or on the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5496)|
| 1:31:42| The reason that she brought that up is because, obviously, there is some unfairness and there is discrepancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5502)|
| 1:31:48| And I think it's ridiculous when I watch the UT basketball game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| which I really hope I can do at eight o'clock tonight because they're playing pretty well right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| is that when they're on the court and they're playing, obviously, they're all over each other, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5515)|
| 1:32:00| But as soon as they get off the court, they put a mask on and they sit 15 feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5520)|
| 1:32:03| If any of those players had COVID and they're playing on that court, we know that it's going to happen there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5523)|
| 1:32:08| So there's a little bit of absurdity to the way we do that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5528)|
| 1:32:12| So she also said, though, that reality is if we reduce the instances in which we use masks, we will see cases go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5532)|
| 1:32:23| I also talked to the local head of a university's nursing department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5543)|
| 1:32:29| She was very concerned that this was something that was up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5549)|
| 1:32:34| She talked a lot anecdotally about just different situations that she's seen and observed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5554)|
| 1:32:39| I talked about the professor. I talked with a professor of nursing who's also an active nurse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5559)|
| 1:32:44| I thought her response was very honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| So she said, well, yeah, I think fine arts and basketball players and others should have the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5568)|
| 1:32:54| And since basketball players aren't wearing masks, then maybe our fine arts people shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5574)|
| 1:32:59| And I said, OK. I said, but do you think that's the right thing from a public health standpoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5579)|
| 1:33:04| She said, no, the way you really fix the fairness is you make the basketball player wear the mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| You don't go the other direction. And so I appreciated her honesty in that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5588)|
| 1:33:13| Also talked to three school administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| They one of the things that they lifted up as a side note is too many of our teachers are having to travel to other counties to get tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5596)|
| 1:33:22| And they would like to figure out how we can fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| All three of those administrators, which are all high school and middle school administrators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| said that they would not change anything related to the way we're doing masks in the arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5607)|
| 1:33:33| I also talked to the head of the Department of Fine Arts within the high school and all the people that report in that in terms of band and choir and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5613)|
| 1:33:45| Every single one of them said it is completely not fair, but we would not feel comfortable changing the policy related to the practices that we have with our students right now in fine arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5625)|
| 1:33:55| Also talked to the head of a large youth serving organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| I thought her response was fairly interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| She said, this seems to be a conversation that only people in West Knoxville are having because people in East Knoxville aren't having this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5641)|
| 1:34:08| I thought that was an interesting commentary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| I also talked to my daughter because my daughter is in choir as a freshman at West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| I will tell you, it was pretty amazing a few months ago when I got to go to see their concert on the football field, distanced and masked, on a nice fall evening, sitting on the football field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5656)|
| 1:34:28| I really appreciated the work that people were doing to make that possible and to keep my daughter safe and others safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5668)|
| 1:34:37| I also spoke with our own central office through an email exchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5677)|
| 1:34:41| I asked them a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| One of the questions that I asked them is, do we have any data that shows the difference in terms of impact with our sports versus our fine arts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5683)|
| 1:34:52| I just received this, so I haven't been able to have dialogue with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5692)|
| 1:34:58| But they said, we've had several middle school and high school basketball teams and cheer squads shut down at various times due to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5698)|
| 1:35:04| Cases on team and or quarantines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| Middle school basketball played about half of their actual schedule this year due to teams or schools being shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5706)|
| 1:35:12| And then with fine arts, they said, fine arts happens in all of our schools all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5712)|
| 1:35:17| And there have been no super spreader events in our performing arts classes or indoor or outdoor performances because our teachers have put into practice safety protocols based on the Colorado Aerosol Study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5717)|
| 1:35:28| So they were saying, yes, we haven't experienced it there because we're doing the things we're supposed to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5728)|
| 1:35:33| I also asked, how were these protocols developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5733)|
| 1:35:37| Because we have this policy, but I want the public to know there's also guidelines on our website about how this policy is implemented within the context of sports and also within the context of our fine arts programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5737)|
| 1:35:47| And so I asked the question, how were those developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| And there was a lot of reference to the Colorado Aerosol Study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5751)|
| 1:35:55| There was reference to different people on our team who have helped put that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5755)|
| 1:35:59| And they did talk about that a lot of what we do in sports has been through the guidance of TWSA and the governor's executive orders that were put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5759)|
| 1:36:09| And then also this fine arts department that I talked to, they sent me a few studies that they've actually consulted with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5769)|
| 1:36:17| And this one particular study, I want to read a couple things out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| So this is from the National Federation of State High School Associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| This was done just on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| Well, it wasn't done, but this was published on December 16th, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5787)|
| 1:36:32| So they said, in its ongoing task of identifying ways to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 in performing arts activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5792)|
| 1:36:41| a third set of preliminary results has been released in the unprecedented aerosol study commissioned by the National Federation of State High School Associations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5801)|
| 1:36:50| the College Band Directors National Association, and a coalition of more than 125 performing arts organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5810)|
| 1:36:57| So this is what they found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| Among the key findings in the most recent results, which focused on the distribution of respiratory aerosol generated while playing wind instruments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5819)|
| 1:37:06| singing, acting, speaking, and dancing, was that if music participants wear surgical style masks, is what the study references,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5826)|
| 1:37:15| with a slit for the mouthpiece and use an appropriate bell cover, that aerosol emission is reduced by 60 to 90 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5835)|
| 1:37:25| They also said, in quote, many high school music programs have been able to continue with their programs from earlier information released through this study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5845)|
| 1:37:35| We anticipate that this latest information will enable even more schools to feel confident in continuing these programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5855)|
| 1:37:43| because the scientific data has become more refined through each state of this process, if all the mitigation steps are followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5863)|
| 1:37:51| We believe students can continue to be engaged performing arts activities this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5871)|
| 1:37:56| And I also want to point out the fact that, although yes, we have a large number, I'm sure, of parents and students across our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5876)|
| 1:38:05| who feel like there's an issue, a fairness issue, I completely agree that it is unfair, but I think in a public health situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5885)|
| 1:38:16| you don't fix the unfairness by reducing restrictions on those that are having tighter restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5896)|
| 1:38:23| You make sure you have the right restrictions in place across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5903)|
| 1:38:27| I'm fine with looking at this and seeing how we can bring more clarity to this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5907)|
| 1:38:31| I don't think we have the time or the people at the table to do that well tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5911)|
| 1:38:36| but I think simply adding that our fine arts participants do not need to wear masks while they perform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5916)|
| 1:38:45| has not been vetted well enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| And I think just from the limited input that Ms. Owens and I have already provided tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5928)|
| 1:38:53| that it doesn't seem like that's the overwhelming consensus from people in our fine arts departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5933)|
| 1:39:01| that that's the direction they want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5943)|
| 1:39:04| Mrs. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5944)|
| 1:39:05| Yeah, I'll keep it brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| I know Daniel isn't the only one wanting to watch that basketball game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5947)|
| 1:39:11| I'm looking at this corner back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5951)|
| 1:39:15| And I'm not going to repeat what's already been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5955)|
| 1:39:18| I do have concerns about transparency and not giving the people who are most affected by this policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5958)|
| 1:39:27| enough time or opportunity to reach out and share their concerns, their opinions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5967)|
| 1:39:34| or maybe even possible ideas as to how we can fix some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5974)|
| 1:39:39| My personal preference would be to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5979)|
| 1:39:43| I don't feel the urgency to change it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| My personal preference would be to see it come up in the March policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5985)|
| 1:39:50| or back up maybe at the March board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5990)|
| 1:39:53| But I just don't feel comfortable changing a policy that affects so many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5993)|
| 1:39:59| without giving them the time and opportunity to voice their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=5999)|
| 1:40:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6005)|
| 1:40:06| Ms. Christie, Ms. Madden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| Yes, and I kind of agree with some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| You know, I do feel like a lot, I think I responded to 45 to 47 emails that people got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6011)|
| 1:40:18| and there was a lot of misunderstanding about what we were going to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6018)|
| 1:40:22| And, you know, the one thing I hated was people misunderstanding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| But I do also think that there is nothing wrong with us having these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6025)|
| 1:40:29| I think this is actually very healthy for us to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6029)|
| 1:40:32| I do think maybe having a little bit more time and a little bit more, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| room to get some of the kind of experts in our community in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| or some of the teachers and stuff like that would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| But I do think the public needs to understand that just because we're talking about something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6041)|
| 1:40:46| it is not this horrible thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| We can talk and discuss, and it doesn't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6048)|
| 1:40:51| I think that's very healthy for us as a school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| And I kind of will disagree a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| I mean, I liked hearing a lot of what Ms. Owens said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| but I will disagree with the fact that how in the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| could we change something halfway through the semester?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| I'll tell you, this virus and what we know about it has changed all year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6065)|
| 1:41:09| And if tomorrow the health department told us we did not have to contact trace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6069)|
| 1:41:13| and have to do math, I would support us changing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6073)|
| 1:41:16| But right now, I support us following the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6076)|
| 1:41:20| We already have seen one change that affected us, and I loved it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| the fact that contact tracing period got to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| So in that way, I do think we do have to look at the data that is coming out from the experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6086)|
| 1:41:31| And right now, I'm looking at the experts as the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6091)|
| 1:41:35| And if their guidance changes, I think we need to be willing to change too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6095)|
| 1:41:40| One of the problems I have, and I do like us talking about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6100)|
| 1:41:44| although kind of at the last minute, is I do sort of hate the unfairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6104)|
| 1:41:48| I mean, I hear a lot about that with the fine arts and the sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6108)|
| 1:41:50| and I think that's what we're all grappling with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6110)|
| 1:41:53| And we all hate what – this is not the year any adult, child, anybody in our community wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6113)|
| 1:41:58| But, you know, I mean, I have seen the fact that we had wrestling and basketball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6118)|
| 1:42:03| and they didn't wear masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| And while I do know some of those contact tracing, I will be honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6125)|
| 1:42:08| I know a lot of the people that have gotten contact traced through sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| and usually it has not been through the playing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| It's kind of the social activity afterwards or the riding in the cars together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6134)|
| 1:42:18| or that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6138)|
| 1:42:19| So that's more what I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6139)|
| 1:42:22| I would love for us to look with the fine arts, and it maybe is even on a case-by-case situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6142)|
| 1:42:28| And I will give an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6148)|
| 1:42:29| I went to the performance that Daniel is referring to at West High School in the fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6149)|
| 1:42:33| and I think a lot of high schools did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| And it was in the football stand, but once again, it was back in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6155)|
| 1:42:39| And it was in the football stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6159)|
| 1:42:41| The kids were so spread out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| They wore masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| And in my mind, I do think, wow, we had wrestlers wrestling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| And we can't have singers 20 feet apart in the stands doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6170)|
| 1:42:55| but maybe it needs to be on a case-by-case situation on what are the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6175)|
| 1:43:00| Is it outside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6180)|
| 1:43:01| And so I think there needs to be some more robust conversation around this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6181)|
| 1:43:04| I 100% think that we need to keep mask-wearing in the schools during the day in all of our classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6184)|
| 1:43:12| But I would like to maybe have some continued discussion, and, you know, I'd love to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6192)|
| 1:43:17| I actually did reach out to some of the performing arts teachers also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6197)|
| 1:43:20| and I actually got some different opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| I mean, some that would like to be able to have some flexibility on not wearing masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6202)|
| 1:43:27| if it can be very social distance, perhaps performances outside, that type of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6207)|
| 1:43:33| So I would like this conversation to continue probably tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6213)|
| 1:43:37| I don't see us coming to any conclusion on it, but that's all I want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6217)|
| 1:43:41| Thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6221)|
| 1:43:42| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6222)|
| 1:43:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6223)|
| 1:43:44| Thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6224)|
| 1:43:45| I do agree with what was said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| I do think that it's about the fundamental fairness about how sports and the fine arts are being treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6227)|
| 1:43:53| My own children have been playing sports since the fall, contact sports, and have not been wearing masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6233)|
| 1:44:00| and I agree the numbers are very low for those sports, and it's just about treating the fine arts just as fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6240)|
| 1:44:07| And I would love to, you know, the data is always changing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6247)|
| 1:44:10| and so we always have to be looking at this, reexamining these facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6250)|
| 1:44:14| and putting in that language will give a little bit more flexibility to the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6254)|
| 1:44:18| And, you know, these are extracurricular activities, and so I think having that flexibility is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6258)|
| 1:44:24| And, you know, I'd also love to have the opportunity for discussion, not tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6264)|
| 1:44:28| but to help those kids that are in quarantine because of all the contact tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6268)|
| 1:44:32| If we do continue to do the contact tracing like we do, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6272)|
| 1:44:35| we have so many children who are quarantined that are falling behind, failing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6275)|
| 1:44:40| and instead of being reactive, I think we need to be proactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| We need to talk about what services we can provide for these children who are being quarantined four or five times in a semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6283)|
| 1:44:50| These children are failing, and if we don't get them the services they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6290)|
| 1:44:54| that's the alternative is having these children that are falling behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6294)|
| 1:44:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6299)|
| 1:45:00| Thank you, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6300)|
| 1:45:01| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6301)|
| 1:45:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6302)|
| 1:45:05| I agree that it might be good to continue the discussion and respect all the board members and their opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6305)|
| 1:45:13| I will say that it's been suggested that we hear from the experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6313)|
| 1:45:18| It's been suggested that we hear from the teachers, and both of those opinions are very valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6318)|
| 1:45:25| But if there's some way in our system where we can do a survey of parents of children that are in the fine arts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6325)|
| 1:45:32| I think we need to hear from them as well, and we need to hear from the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6332)|
| 1:45:37| because those are the ones that are being most directly impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6337)|
| 1:45:41| So while I think it's very important that we get all the experts in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6341)|
| 1:45:45| and we get all the, you know, people that are in charge of the music programs in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6345)|
| 1:45:50| I think we also need to hear from the parents and the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6350)|
| 1:45:53| And I don't know how much work that would put on the staff or if it can even be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6353)|
| 1:45:58| I will say personally that we solved our family problem by, at the change of the semester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6358)|
| 1:46:04| getting out of band and moving to a different subject, but not everybody can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6364)|
| 1:46:10| And, you know, we found when my grandson was quarantined, band was not real effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6370)|
| 1:46:17| Or when his school went on red, there's something missing there in the band experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6377)|
| 1:46:24| when you're sitting in your room by yourself with or without an instrument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6384)|
| 1:46:29| and the educator is playing his instrument, not to mention the fact that he just complained every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6389)|
| 1:46:36| about all he had to do to be able to play a horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6396)|
| 1:46:40| So, you know, we solved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| He's no longer in band, and I was told he was the best there was in that band,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6402)|
| 1:46:48| which is really sad because he's missing an opportunity, but he hated every minute of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6408)|
| 1:46:53| So, anyway, I think we need to hear from the parents and the students as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6413)|
| 1:46:58| Thank you, Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| Oh, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| Yes, I'll just say quickly, I don't oppose changing it to making it for band students and art students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6422)|
| 1:47:10| My personal opinion, again, I have not seen any data or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| I just don't think this is the right timing to make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6433)|
| 1:47:17| Actually, not at all this semester when it comes to masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6437)|
| 1:47:20| I think this should be something we evaluate and put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6440)|
| 1:47:23| But if we do make the change, put it in place for the school year 2021-2022| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6443)|
| 1:47:28| because parents have made decisions regarding policies that we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| And I do know that if things come out new that we have an area to change and we can move that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6452)|
| 1:47:38| but no new data has come out that showed that we should be lifting masks at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6458)|
| 1:47:44| Thank you, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6464)|
| 1:47:46| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6466)|
| 1:47:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6467)|
| 1:47:48| I'm not opposed to changing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6468)|
| 1:47:51| I kind of share Ms. Satterfield's opinion at some point in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6471)|
| 1:47:59| I do, and I don't mean to be derogatory or hurt anybody's feelings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6479)|
| 1:48:07| but my guess would be we talk about the so-called experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6487)|
| 1:48:15| When it comes to this virus, I'm not sure that we have anybody that is an expert, a bona fide expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6495)|
| 1:48:29| I would say that if you wanted to go find, if one expert says one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6509)|
| 1:48:41| if you take the time to go find somebody to counter that with a high-powered doctor or psychologist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6521)|
| 1:48:53| whoever it might be, and all of them have a certain amount, a certain degree of credibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6533)|
| 1:49:03| Now, I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6543)|
| 1:49:06| When somebody mentioned the World Health Organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6546)|
| 1:49:12| I wouldn't put any confidence whatsoever in that organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6552)|
| 1:49:19| because it's highly controlled by the, there are a number of countries that belong to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6559)|
| 1:49:29| but it is paid for and controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6569)|
| 1:49:39| That's a prudent fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6579)|
| 1:49:42| But that aside, that's about all I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6582)|
| 1:49:49| I'd be glad to look at it, but I think we probably should continue as we are temporarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6589)|
| 1:49:59| particularly if Ms. Owens read those comments to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6599)|
| 1:50:11| if that's an indication of how the majority of Maryland high school folks feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6611)|
| 1:50:18| But, you know, again, there's nothing wrong with hearing from the parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6618)|
| 1:50:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6623)|
| 1:50:24| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6624)|
| 1:50:25| Mr. Thomas, did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6625)|
| 1:50:27| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6627)|
| 1:50:28| I appreciate the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6628)|
| 1:50:30| So let me just say, too, you know, the policy, in terms of the policy, I appreciate the discussion and conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6630)|
| 1:50:38| and agree maybe there needs to be more conversation about it because I'm frustrated as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6638)|
| 1:50:45| You know, we've got a policy, we've tried to implement it with fidelity, and I think we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6645)|
| 1:50:50| And I think it's really a good policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6650)|
| 1:50:52| So I did a little bit of research on my own as well, about my personal opinions, what I'm sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6652)|
| 1:50:57| I won't share my personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| I'll share the opinion that I need to have in terms of protect the health, safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6659)|
| 1:51:04| and welfare of 8,000, 10,000 employees and 58,000, 59,000 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6664)|
| 1:51:12| And, hey, believe me, I'm tired of wearing a mask, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| I shared Daniel's sentiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6675)|
| 1:51:17| I'd like to burn them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| So we'll do it together when that time comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6679)|
| 1:51:22| But, again, the medical experts have told us what they have told us, that the masks are effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6682)|
| 1:51:29| I think, you know, we were able to stay in school 70 of 75 days in fall semester with this current policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6689)|
| 1:51:35| We've been able to stay in school, knock on wood, 24 out of 26 days this semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6695)|
| 1:51:40| And the two days we haven't been in were inclement weather days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6700)|
| 1:51:43| which we didn't really have a whole lot of inclement weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6703)|
| 1:51:45| But nonetheless, we stayed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6705)|
| 1:51:48| And the hope is to finish this semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| And I looked at the most recent information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6711)|
| 1:51:54| Now, whether you agree with the Center for Disease Control or not, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6714)|
| 1:51:59| Again, I'm not a medical expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6719)|
| 1:52:01| I have to rely on the information that I can research myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6721)|
| 1:52:05| It's amazing when I looked at the most recent CDC guidelines today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6725)|
| 1:52:10| and they came out December, I believe, 18th of 2020, so just a couple of months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6730)|
| 1:52:16| Amazingly, mirror what our policy is, I mean, even to the extent of talking about performances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6736)|
| 1:52:25| And if you can social distance, it does say, you know, if we wanted zero risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6745)|
| 1:52:29| the way to get zero risk is have no school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6749)|
| 1:52:32| But that's not the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| The way to get low risk is by doing the things that we talked about doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6754)|
| 1:52:39| what we have implemented here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6759)|
| 1:52:41| And again, you know, you all set the policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| and Dr. George, we'll implement whatever, you know, the policy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| But I also talked to Dr. Childs at East Tennessee Children's Hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6767)|
| 1:52:52| the chief medical officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6772)|
| 1:52:54| He subscribes to what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6774)|
| 1:52:56| He said, now is not the time to let your guard down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6776)|
| 1:53:00| Keep doing what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6780)|
| 1:53:02| Things are improving, but don't do anything different at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6782)|
| 1:53:07| I talked to Dr. Rasnick today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| He is the epidemiologist at UT Medical Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6789)|
| 1:53:12| Basically the same conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| Hey, what you're doing, and by the way, he shared with me he has a child in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6794)|
| 1:53:19| and certainly applauded the principal and the staff at that school for the work that they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6799)|
| 1:53:26| So, again, same kind of conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6806)|
| 1:53:28| Hey, this is not the time to let your guard down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6808)|
| 1:53:32| Continue to do what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6812)|
| 1:53:34| And, you know, so, again, those are two of the local medical experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6814)|
| 1:53:41| CDC is, of course, more national, regional, whatever, out of Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6821)|
| 1:53:45| So, and the policy does allow for individual schools to do what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6825)|
| 1:53:52| When you read the policy, it's if instructional needs call for not to wear a mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6832)|
| 1:53:58| and you can physically distance between the teacher and the principal, that decision can be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6838)|
| 1:54:04| So I think it does provide for some individual kinds of things that, you know, at our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6844)|
| 1:54:11| So, and I don't mind, we'll do a survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6851)|
| 1:54:14| I know before we came out with the indoor performance protocols, we did a little bit of surveying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6854)|
| 1:54:20| and I think it was about 80 percent of our choral directors, music teachers said no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6860)|
| 1:54:25| in terms of would you want your students performing without a mask on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6865)|
| 1:54:30| So, and again, but the pressure, you know, for me is, hey, let kids have these opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6870)|
| 1:54:35| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6875)|
| 1:54:36| I mean, I know our students need to have an opportunity to do the things that we can let them do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6876)|
| 1:54:40| And I want to do that, but I also want to do it safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6880)|
| 1:54:42| And I just have to say, yeah, it is about the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6882)|
| 1:54:45| It's all about the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| But you know what, it takes the adults to be in the facility with the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6887)|
| 1:54:51| so the students can have those opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6891)|
| 1:54:53| And I appreciate Tonya and our teachers and our principals and our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6893)|
| 1:54:58| They have done an incredible job this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| Incredible. Phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6901)|
| 1:55:04| I can't think of all the adjectives to describe how hard our teachers and our principals have worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6904)|
| 1:55:10| to make this year as much as normal as they could make for, you know, for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6910)|
| 1:55:15| And yes, it's not normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6915)|
| 1:55:16| I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| So I think we have to certainly be concerned about our teachers who some have underlying health conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6918)|
| 1:55:27| Some live in households where family members have underlying health conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6927)|
| 1:55:31| So I think we have to be, we have to think about the adults as well here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6931)|
| 1:55:37| So anyway, I do appreciate the conversation, the discussion, and whatever decision you all make, we'll implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6937)|
| 1:55:44| But it's hard to argue with success, in my opinion, than the success we've had this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6944)|
| 1:55:52| We may want to go back and revisit for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| Next fall, hopefully it's going to look entirely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6954)|
| 1:55:57| The vaccine, people take the vaccine and maybe herd immunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6957)|
| 1:56:01| And I'm hopeful that next year, you know, I've probably got less time around here than a lot of other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6961)|
| 1:56:07| I want to experience normal in what time I've got left around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6967)|
| 1:56:12| So I want it just as bad as everybody else does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6972)|
| 1:56:16| I want to be able to go to restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6976)|
| 1:56:17| I want to be able to sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6977)|
| 1:56:18| I want to not wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6978)|
| 1:56:20| I want to talk to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6980)|
| 1:56:21| I want to be able to shake people's hands, just do the things that we've all done, hug the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6981)|
| 1:56:26| So believe me, you know, that's my feeling about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6986)|
| 1:56:30| And, you know, you all have done an incredible job with this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6990)|
| 1:56:34| You've done an incredible job this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6994)|
| 1:56:37| So I applaud you for all the work you've done and the concern and so forth that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=6997)|
| 1:56:42| And I've rambled on far enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| So thank you for the opportunity, Madam Chair and board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7004)|
| 1:56:47| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7007)|
| 1:56:49| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7009)|
| 1:56:50| Madam Chair, I just have a request of Superintendent Thomas, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7010)|
| 1:56:54| Could we at some point have Heather Castile present to us that Colorado aerosol study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7014)|
| 1:57:00| I know that she is very, very well versed in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7020)|
| 1:57:02| And I think it would be very helpful for us to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7022)|
| 1:57:05| I know the staff has heard it, but I think this board should hear it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7025)|
| 1:57:09| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7029)|
| 1:57:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7031)|
| 1:57:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7032)|
| 1:57:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7033)|
| 1:57:15| So I appreciate Ms. Babb's comments about discussing this in an open forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7035)|
| 1:57:21| I think that when we hear, you know, testimony from different entities, it's up to us to take that and create policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7041)|
| 1:57:32| But I think that we have to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| We have to have those conversations to make sure that we're making good decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7054)|
| 1:57:38| And so I apologize that this was added at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7058)|
| 1:57:43| I'm not trying to pull anything over on anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7063)|
| 1:57:46| This is a situation that just kept popping up, and I felt like perhaps adding clarifying language would help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7066)|
| 1:57:54| because I continue to hound Superintendent Thomas about this every time I hear from parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7074)|
| 1:58:01| And I've heard from parents of at least three different high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7081)|
| 1:58:05| And so anyway, I just felt like that we needed to talk about it, and we really couldn't wait to talk about it for another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7085)|
| 1:58:13| And so that's ‑‑ I mean, that's ‑‑ I try to be straightforward and honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7093)|
| 1:58:20| That's what happened Friday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7100)|
| 1:58:22| I said to Renee and Bob, I was like, okay, I think the board just needs to talk about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7102)|
| 1:58:27| because we just needed to have some conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7107)|
| 1:58:30| So that's the honesty of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7110)|
| 1:58:34| I think we also ‑‑ obviously our conversations are public, and that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7114)|
| 1:58:39| But we have to remember, this is our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7119)|
| 1:58:42| The reason that we meet is to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7122)|
| 1:58:45| So I appreciate you guys being flexible and talking about this when I added it on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7125)|
| 1:58:53| And Superintendent Thomas and I discussed that and decided to add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7133)|
| 1:58:58| So I appreciate you guys accommodating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| I agree, it's not ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| And I know some people didn't have a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7143)|
| 1:59:06| I had no idea that all these people were going to speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7146)|
| 1:59:09| They didn't even know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| I don't know how they found out that this was added unless it was just the Facebook post last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7151)|
| 1:59:15| I never even told anybody that it was being added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7155)|
| 1:59:18| So anyway, I apologize that it was added late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7158)|
| 1:59:25| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7165)|
| 1:59:27| Thank you, Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7167)|
| 1:59:29| I just want to say I think your intent was good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7169)|
| 1:59:32| I don't think there's any maliciousness in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7172)|
| 1:59:35| I just ‑‑ as somebody who always wants to be really prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7175)|
| 1:59:40| and be able to have the dialogue that needs to be had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7180)|
| 1:59:44| I think we all know that this is the type of issue in our community right now that's emotionally charged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7184)|
| 1:59:49| I mean, we saw that because we did have this many people come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7189)|
| 1:59:52| And so, again, I don't think there's any maliciousness or ill intent by adding it at the time that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7192)|
| 1:59:58| But I would like a little more deference with that type of issue to be able to both give the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7198)|
| 2:00:05| and the community and also us time to do our work to be able to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7205)|
| 2:00:09| And I think the discussion has to be had, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7209)|
| 2:00:12| I mean, what are we doing up here if we're not willing to have the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| So all that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7214)|
| 2:00:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7216)|
| 2:00:17| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7217)|
| 2:00:18| And I appreciate your sentiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7218)|
| 2:00:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7219)|
| 2:00:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7221)|
| 2:00:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7222)|
| 2:00:23| I think we have a couple of action points, so we'll move on, Ms. Coatney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7223)|
| 2:00:29| 7A, approve memorandum of understanding with Knox Education Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7229)|
| 2:00:33| approving grant funding for the Elevate program in the amount of $154,365.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7233)|
| 2:00:39| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7239)|
| 2:00:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7240)|
| 2:00:41| We have a motion by Ms. Christie, a second by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7241)|
| 2:00:44| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7244)|
| 2:00:45| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7245)|

| 2:03:05| Mr. Bolton, I apologize for forgetting to ask this earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7385)|
| 2:03:09| I understand that we need to digitize our documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7389)|
| 2:03:13| Is there a reason that we are storing them with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7393)|
| 2:03:16| instead of in our own data center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7396)|
| 2:03:20| Madam Chair, the rest of the board, thank you for this opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7400)|
| 2:03:23| We're actually looking at actually thinking about storing them internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7403)|
| 2:03:28| The contract allows for us to scan those documents with their support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7408)|
| 2:03:34| It provides, I think there's 10 commercial scanners that will also be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7414)|
| 2:03:39| so that we can scan those documents and image them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7419)|
| 2:03:42| And as far as the location of those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7422)|
| 2:03:46| we've got the opportunity to either go in that direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7426)|
| 2:03:50| because that's what was on the contract with Clarksville-Montgomery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7430)|
| 2:03:55| but we also have the capacity to do it internally as well, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7435)|
| 2:03:58| I'd have to defer to Freddie on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7438)|
| 2:04:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7440)|
| 2:04:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7441)|
| 2:04:02| When you discuss that, and I'm just thinking of this as we go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7442)|
| 2:04:07| maybe that would be a good backup location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7447)|
| 2:04:10| but I would be concerned about having that as our only location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7450)|
| 2:04:13| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7453)|

| 2:06:23| I mean, and this is just procedurally, when something like this comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7583)|
| 2:06:27| does it have to go through the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7587)|
| 2:06:29| I mean, since it's sort of a budgeting item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7589)|
| 2:06:31| or is it under our control to make this decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7591)|

| 2:06:38| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7598)|
| 2:06:40| This is an item that should go through both bodies, is my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7600)|

| 2:09:47| I'd first like to call Jonathan Dunham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7787)|

| 2:10:21| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7821)|
| 2:10:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7822)|
| 2:10:23| If you could just say your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7823)|
| 2:10:25| and then you've got five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7825)|
| 2:10:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7827)|
| 2:10:28| My name is Suzanne Graves, and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7828)|
| 2:10:30| I want to start by telling you a little about my children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7830)|
| 2:10:33| Both are athletes in high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| My daughter was able to make it through volleyball season with minimal harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7835)|
| 2:10:38| My son, however, had to miss his baseball season last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7838)|
| 2:10:41| in which he started varsity as a freshman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7841)|
| 2:10:44| As a sophomore, he has already had multiple offers from college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7844)|
| 2:10:47| I mention this as he is so afraid of being quarantined during baseball season due to contact tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7847)|
| 2:10:53| He's confident that he would fail if he had to do virtual school for any length of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7853)|
| 2:10:59| My son has ADHD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| School doesn't come easy for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| He realizes he must be in class with teachers to be at his best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7863)|
| 2:11:09| Baseball is his passion, and God has gifted him with this talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7869)|
| 2:11:12| He knows if his grades aren't good, his baseball future is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7872)|
| 2:11:16| It infuriates me that my 15-year-old son is concerned about getting a call from the nurse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7876)|
| 2:11:22| that he'll be quarantined when all he should be worried about is if his curveball is breaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7882)|
| 2:11:28| I would like to ask the board for a show of hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7888)|
| 2:11:31| Have any of you had the opportunity to sit and listen in on a virtual or remote learning class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7891)|
| 2:11:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7899)|
| 2:11:40| I have, numerous times with both of my children, with many different teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7900)|
| 2:11:45| I'd like to give you a few examples of what I saw and heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7905)|
| 2:11:49| In one instance, a teacher who was at home on quarantine with COVID gave instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7909)|
| 2:11:54| and designated one student who sat in the middle of the class to be logged in to the computer with the microphone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7914)|
| 2:12:01| All others were to sit, COVID distanced, and try to hear her teach a geometry class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7921)|
| 2:12:07| Needless to say, 80% of the class failed this module test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7927)|
| 2:12:11| In another class, the teacher had her computer and camera on, but had it turned toward the wall while she was teaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7931)|
| 2:12:18| This class is a hands-on and instructional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7938)|
| 2:12:21| Tell me how that worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7941)|
| 2:12:23| Teachers start their class by taking attendance, give the kids an assignment, tell them when it's due, and log off without instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7943)|
| 2:12:30| Then they're appalled by the fact that kids look on the internet for guidance and assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7950)|
| 2:12:35| I've had many friends whose kids have been quarantined more than once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7955)|
| 2:12:38| They've missed out on a ton of valuable in-person instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7958)|
| 2:12:42| Virtual school is not effective in what our children need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7962)|
| 2:12:46| We are quarantining healthy students and teachers at an alarming rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7966)|
| 2:12:51| Many of these people never become ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7971)|
| 2:12:53| It's insane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7973)|
| 2:12:54| Students who are not vulnerable should be living their lives as normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7974)|
| 2:12:57| They should be in school, enjoying extracurricular activities, including sports, music, arts, without restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7977)|
| 2:13:04| Our kids need the social interaction with their peers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7984)|
| 2:13:08| For many, kids' school is their lifeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7988)|
| 2:13:11| Seeing an increase in numbers is not necessarily a bad thing and needs to stop being treated this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7991)|
| 2:13:16| Many who have tested positive have been false positive due to faulty testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=7996)|
| 2:13:20| Many who have tested positive have never been sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8000)|
| 2:13:23| And in many cases, some that have tested positive in your own household, everyone else is tested positive without being tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8003)|
| 2:13:31| How does it make sense to send a child home for contact tracing four full days after they were around someone that tested positive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8011)|
| 2:13:39| Have we thrown all common sense out the door, and are we unable to think for ourselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8019)|
| 2:13:44| The answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8024)|
| 2:13:45| The CDC and Board of Health have issued guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8025)|
| 2:13:49| I would say that's just what they are, guidelines, not laws, not written in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8029)|
| 2:13:54| And you have the authority to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8034)|
| 2:13:57| At this point, I don't believe the guidelines are working as well as they should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8037)|
| 2:14:01| I am not asking you to place people at risk, but to examine the policies and the numbers provided and meet the communities you serve halfway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8041)|
| 2:14:11| A long time ago, we left Middle Ages and we live in a democracy where together we fight for answers that benefit everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8051)|
| 2:14:17| This is no different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| And right now, we are not being successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8059)|
| 2:14:21| Our country is made up of courageous people that dare to be different while making educated decisions and starting national trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8061)|
| 2:14:28| Let's not follow the herd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8068)|
| 2:14:30| Let's be the herd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8070)|
| 2:14:32| Families are suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8072)|
| 2:14:33| Children are suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8073)|
| 2:14:34| Many parents are being forced to become part-time teachers, and not very good ones, while praying not to lose their full-time jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8074)|
| 2:14:41| We've seen increased stress, anxiety, depression, economic hardship, hopelessness, drug and alcohol use, child abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8081)|
| 2:14:47| The list goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8087)|
| 2:14:49| But it's only as if COVID matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8089)|
| 2:14:51| If you care about the health of the community, then you care about the health of all people and what's happening to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8091)|
| 2:14:57| It's time to end contact tracing, quarantining of healthy children and teachers in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8097)|
| 2:15:03| Remember, to do nothing is to be part of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8103)|
| 2:15:07| To at least do something gives us hope that we are truly partnering together to solve the issues together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8107)|
| 2:15:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8113)|
| 2:15:14| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8114)|
| 2:15:18| Brooke Chester?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8118)|
| 2:15:27| Hi, if you'll just state your name and county of residence, and then you have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8127)|
| 2:15:31| Brooke Chester, I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8131)|
| 2:15:34| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8134)|
| 2:15:36| I come here today humbly and respectfully to ask that you will hear and consider these thoughts as you make decisions for our children and families of the Knox County school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8136)|
| 2:15:49| In choosing to utilize this zoning procedure to determine if a school is to be open or closed, as adopted in other states and other parts of the country, I feel the Knox County School Board has dismissed three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8149)|
| 2:16:04| First, our location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8164)|
| 2:16:06| We reside in Knoxville, Tennessee, which is located in Appalachia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8166)|
| 2:16:12| In a good year without COVID or a pandemic, many students will not stay in school or graduate from a local high school in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8172)|
| 2:16:22| An example that is close to home for me is my own great grandmother who lived in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8182)|
| 2:16:28| I knew her very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8188)|
| 2:16:31| She didn't pass away until I was in my 20s, and she received a sixth grade education because her family pulled her out of school after sixth grade to stay home and work on their farm in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8191)|
| 2:16:45| I also have an example of several cousins my own age that did not graduate from high school in Knox County, though they lived there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8205)|
| 2:16:54| May I remind you that East Tennessee, as well as the state, has been infiltrated by the opioid epidemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8214)|
| 2:17:01| Generations previous to my own would say, stay in school, as an answer to the question, how do we keep our children from drug addictions, alcohol addictions, and pregnancies prior to adult age?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8221)|
| 2:17:18| Secondly, I believe this school board has dismissed and forgotten working families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8238)|
| 2:17:25| I'm an essential working mother in health care, in our community, and just yesterday told my employer I am happy to help with administering COVID vaccines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8245)|
| 2:17:37| but do not schedule me because I do not know what Knox County schools are going to do regarding my children's elementary school education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8257)|
| 2:17:45| Lastly, I feel that Knox County has dismissed the importance of consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8265)|
| 2:17:52| May I share with you that consistency is why I thrived in school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8272)|
| 2:17:57| I knew what to expect daily, and I was able to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8277)|
| 2:18:02| Psychologists will state that routines, set expectations, and the like, help those who experience any kind of trauma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8282)|
| 2:18:11| I want to ask this school board, how has irregular and erratic scheduling in Knox County schools contributed to the trauma families are experiencing today in 2021 and going back to March 2020?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8291)|
| 2:18:26| I believe this flippant, knee-jerk behavior in changing schedules from in-person to virtual, as well as in the school closures from last year, result in a great disheartening reaction from everyone affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8306)|
| 2:18:40| Teachers, parents, and children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8320)|
| 2:18:43| The idea of why even try might be the theme heard among all affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8323)|
| 2:18:49| In closing, I know Knox County can do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8329)|
| 2:18:53| I know this because I attended a Knox County school, Carnes Primary from first grade all the way to graduation from Carnes High School in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8333)|
| 2:19:05| I went on to Maryville College and at Sanford University in Birmingham where I received a pharmacy degree that I use now in your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8345)|
| 2:19:15| I want to remind the school board there was a time in which you believed in the idea of kids being physically present in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8355)|
| 2:19:27| It was extremely important to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8367)|
| 2:19:30| I know it because I witnessed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8370)|
| 2:19:33| I witnessed this leadership in the early 90s when I was required to attend school on Saturdays for a time due to missed school days during the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8373)|
| 2:19:45| This requirement was issued countywide at the time and I was very young and remember my parents taking me to school on Saturdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8385)|
| 2:19:57| I ask you remember our conservative values in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8397)|
| 2:20:02| This is not New York State or New York City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8402)|
| 2:20:05| As well as the importance of consistency, dependability, and leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8405)|
| 2:20:11| Please drop these zoning rules that are now in place and keep our schools open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8411)|
| 2:20:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8419)|
| 2:20:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8422)|
| 2:20:26| Micah Richardson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8426)|
| 2:20:37| Is Micah Richardson here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8437)|
| 2:20:38| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8438)|
| 2:20:39| If you could state your name and county of residence and you have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8439)|
| 2:20:43| Micah Richardson, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8443)|
| 2:20:47| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8447)|
| 2:20:49| I just wanted to speak on a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8449)|
| 2:20:51| I was here prior, I mean last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8451)|
| 2:20:54| Now I'm here this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8454)|
| 2:20:56| The topic I was supposed to come here and speak about was the curriculum was my topic for this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8456)|
| 2:21:02| But at the same time I still had some unfinished business from the last time I was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8462)|
| 2:21:06| The proposal I made was to be rid of any pork products that are being served to our children in the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8466)|
| 2:21:17| I talked to, I believe it was Ms. Foster, the executive director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8477)|
| 2:21:22| I spoke to her on a phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8482)|
| 2:21:25| She just expressed that she's not going to do nothing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8485)|
| 2:21:30| That she doesn't have to, especially dealing with my children for their special needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8490)|
| 2:21:36| As well for, you know, it's just one family that I know of that are Jews that are going to these public school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8496)|
| 2:21:46| And so the issue that I'm having is nobody has given my son anything warm to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8506)|
| 2:21:55| While everybody else is eating warm foods, he's still having to eat a jelly sandwich that he doesn't eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8515)|
| 2:22:00| He just makes up for it with an extra tater tot or extra vegetable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8520)|
| 2:22:04| And I feel like, you know, this is the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8524)|
| 2:22:07| They're supposed to care about the welfare of these children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8527)|
| 2:22:10| But I don't see anybody caring about no children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8530)|
| 2:22:13| Because you definitely don't care about my son eating nothing warm when everybody's eating pulled pork sandwiches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8533)|
| 2:22:19| And he has to eat the cold Jenny O turkey ham sandwiches that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8539)|
| 2:22:27| This is very, you know, I'm very disquieted and distressed over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8547)|
| 2:22:32| Because it's vexing my heart that I have to send him to school and not be able to eat, you know, something warm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8552)|
| 2:22:38| When he's at home, I prepare something warm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8558)|
| 2:22:40| When he's hungry, I feed it to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8560)|
| 2:22:42| But in the school system here, like, oh, no, we don't have to do anything to help out the children, you know, to anybody's religious backgrounds or beliefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8562)|
| 2:22:54| But I have purposely went to the doctor and got him a doctor's note because he's the allergy of the pork meat and anything dealing with iodine and shellfish and anything that's, you know, abomination, according to the Bible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8574)|
| 2:23:11| A lot of loose words I hear everybody speaking about God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8591)|
| 2:23:14| I'm going to read this scripture out of 1 John chapter 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8594)|
| 2:23:18| It says, he that saith I know him and keepeth not the commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him, according to John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8598)|
| 2:23:24| Peace be upon him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8604)|
| 2:23:26| So the next topic I was coming here today was the curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8606)|
| 2:23:29| I would like to ask, you know, what would you do about how would you feel about getting rid of Christmas, Valentine's Day, Easter and any other pagan idolatry or any type of Greek mythology that you push like Icarus and St.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8609)|
| 2:23:45| Valentine and Valentine's Day, cupids, arrows and all these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8625)|
| 2:23:49| You know, there needs to be a time where, you know, the unheard, the unspoken, the silent majority gets to say in these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8629)|
| 2:23:59| And that's why I'm here, because nobody wants to speak up against this, this big Goliath of a giant you guys have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8639)|
| 2:24:05| But I'll be David and I'll take his heart and I'll have a heart after my God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8645)|
| 2:24:10| And I'll fight that battle, this uphill battle to deter this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8650)|
| 2:24:15| And if you don't want to do away with your culture and implement everybody's culture, like Kwanzaa, dealing with the African community, Ramadan for the Muslims, you know, for me it would be the Hanukkah, you know, Sukkot, Tabernacles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8655)|
| 2:24:35| You don't implement none of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8675)|
| 2:24:36| You don't have no Jewish teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8676)|
| 2:24:38| You don't have no Muslim teacher putting their things in these school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8678)|
| 2:24:44| But we're on the ground roots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8684)|
| 2:24:45| Yeah, we're in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8685)|
| 2:24:47| And we're going to have to do a ground roots movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8687)|
| 2:24:50| I know nobody wants to pick up this proposal, these things that I speak of, because you've got this prestige and this honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8690)|
| 2:24:58| But like I told you before, I'm dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8698)|
| 2:25:00| I'm nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8700)|
| 2:25:01| And I'll fight and I'll continue to fight this battle for my children and for everybody else who has the agreements with the policies and procedures that the school system continues to disregard everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8701)|
| 2:25:14| But this evangelistic Christian belief system that's been put here, well, I know the demographic that I live in here in Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8714)|
| 2:25:25| Yeah, there's 100,000, you know, non-Latino, non-ethnic background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8725)|
| 2:25:32| And 100, you know, 75 percent of the community is all white and 25 is minorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210210?start=8732)|
