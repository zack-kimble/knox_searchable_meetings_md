| 4:21:46| or is it just men and it's just women?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15706)|
| 4:21:48| It's for men and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15708)|
| 4:21:51| The building is situated so there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15711)|
| 4:21:53| separation in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15713)|
| 4:21:56| It's a U-shaped area for the patient bedrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15716)|
| 4:22:01| but it's for men and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15721)|
| 4:22:03| The men are on one side, the women on the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15723)|
| 4:22:05| and they're adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15725)|
| 4:22:10| So in supervision of being men and women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15730)|
| 4:22:13| in this kind of situation, so if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15733)|
| 4:22:16| say there's two staff per patient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15736)|
| 4:22:19| so at all times except, of course, when they're sleeping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15739)|
| 4:22:22| there's going to be that number of staff there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15742)|
| 4:22:28| So there's 43 beds, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15748)|
| 4:22:30| Yeah, 44 beds on a given day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15750)|
| 4:22:34| It's hard to always have 44 patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15754)|
| 4:22:36| but yeah, on a given day when the patients are in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15756)|
| 4:22:40| there's 70 to 80 employees in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15760)|
| 4:22:45| OK, of course, my major concern is for the elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15765)|
| 4:22:49| and the children there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15769)|
| 4:22:50| So that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15770)|
| 4:22:53| Thank you, Ms. Vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15773)|
| 4:22:55| Chair will recognize Commissioner Scott-Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15775)|
| 4:23:00| OK, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15780)|
| 4:23:02| I just wanted to ask about your typical client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15782)|
| 4:23:07| how long do they stay for in your program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15787)|
| 4:23:09| Is it like a month, and do they typically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15789)|
| 4:23:13| pay through a government program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15793)|
| 4:23:15| or are these people self-funding their treatment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15795)|
| 4:23:21| OK, the average length of stay in our facilities is 22 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15801)|
| 4:23:26| so three weeks in a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15806)|
| 4:23:30| 80% to 90% of our clients are in the facility between two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15810)|
| 4:23:36| and four weeks, but it's a 22-day average length of stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15816)|
| 4:23:40| And 90% plus of our clients are funded through insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15820)|
| 4:23:44| such as Blue Cross, Aetna, Magellan, United.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15824)|
| 4:23:50| Did I answer you, Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15830)|
| 4:23:52| Yes, sir, you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15832)|
| 4:23:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15833)|
| 4:23:54| I think these kind of, I mean, the big deal to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15834)|
| 4:23:57| is that these are people who are seeking help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15837)|
| 4:24:00| They're trying to better their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15840)|
| 4:24:03| They're funding this themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15843)|
| 4:24:04| They're there voluntarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15844)|
| 4:24:06| And these are probably the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15846)|
| 4:24:08| that if you go to a restaurant or bar a couple of months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15848)|
| 4:24:10| earlier, you've seen them at the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15850)|
| 4:24:12| So I mean, I don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15852)|
| 4:24:16| I think this is something that's necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15856)|
| 4:24:18| and I don't think, I mean, my perception, I could be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15858)|
| 4:24:22| My perception is these are not dangerous people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15862)|
| 4:24:24| But anyway, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15864)|
| 4:24:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15867)|
| 4:24:28| Chair recognizes Commissioner Corblick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15868)|
| 4:24:32| Yeah, I read quite a few, I read all the letters regarding this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15872)|
| 4:24:38| from the community, and it seems that the big concern is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15878)|
| 4:24:42| the patients who might voluntarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15882)|
| 4:24:44| choose to leave walking out down onto Andersonville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15884)|
| 4:24:53| And then the relationship between that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15893)|
| 4:24:55| and any schoolchildren that might be at the elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15895)|
| 4:24:58| school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15898)|
| 4:24:59| We know nowadays elementary schools are all locked up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15899)|
| 4:25:03| and it's difficult even for a parent to get into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15903)|
| 4:25:06| But I did wonder about patients voluntarily leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15906)|
| 4:25:12| Can they just kind of slip out the door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15912)|
| 4:25:14| You probably mentioned it, but I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15914)|
| 4:25:15| like you to repeat that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15915)|
| 4:25:18| The patients can leave, but we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15918)|
| 4:25:21| have experiences with people going out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15921)|
| 4:25:23| into the neighborhoods at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15923)|
| 4:25:26| There are staff members watching them, watching our doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15926)|
| 4:25:29| If a person opens the door, we know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15929)|
| 4:25:33| And so we just haven't had problems with our patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15933)|
| 4:25:37| going into the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15937)|
| 4:25:38| And please keep in mind this, part of my response here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15938)|
| 4:25:42| these folks are normally working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15942)|
| 4:25:44| or they're a spouse with children at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15944)|
| 4:25:47| and they're seeking help with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15947)|
| 4:25:50| So they come to us voluntarily, and they're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15950)|
| 4:25:54| going roaming around the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15954)|
| 4:25:56| to cause a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15956)|
| 4:25:58| We just haven't had that be an issue with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15958)|
| 4:26:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15964)|
| 4:26:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15965)|
| 4:26:11| Staff will, chair will recognize Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15971)|
| 4:26:14| Thank you, Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15974)|
| 4:26:16| You know, they're already in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15976)|
| 4:26:18| Some choose to be treated, and some choose not to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15978)|
| 4:26:22| So the idea that we're exposed to something, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15982)|
| 4:26:26| is just not accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15986)|
| 4:26:29| I think it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15989)|
| 4:26:30| I think we're starved for services like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15990)|
| 4:26:34| I've had loved ones that needed treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15994)|
| 4:26:37| and they had to go to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15997)|
| 4:26:39| And they had, you know, there were lengthy waits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=15999)|
| 4:26:44| So I think these services are desperately needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16004)|
| 4:26:48| And I think this is an appropriate place for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16008)|
| 4:26:50| And I think we need to start not looking at them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16010)|
| 4:26:54| as though we're treating criminals here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16014)|
| 4:26:55| and we're treating people who want to be helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16015)|
| 4:26:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16017)|
| 4:26:58| I'll support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16018)|
| 4:27:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16020)|
| 4:27:01| All right, gentlemen, ladies, commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16021)|
| 4:27:04| entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16024)|
| 4:27:06| I'll make a motion that we approve the request for a 44| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16026)|
| 4:27:09| bed recovery housing facility for substance abuse treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16029)|
| 4:27:12| limited to individuals seeking treatment voluntarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16032)|
| 4:27:15| and that are not compelled by court order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16035)|
| 4:27:17| or other involuntary action subject to the four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16037)|
| 4:27:20| conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16040)|
| 4:27:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16041)|
| 4:27:22| Second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16042)|
| 4:27:24| I have a motion by Commissioner Scott Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16044)|
| 4:27:27| seconded by Dick Graff, Commissioner Graff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16047)|
| 4:27:32| Call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16052)|
| 4:27:35| Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16055)|
| 4:27:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16056)|
| 4:27:37| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16057)|
| 4:27:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16062)|
| 4:27:44| Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16064)|
| 4:27:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16065)|
| 4:27:46| Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16066)|
| 4:27:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16069)|
| 4:27:50| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16070)|
| 4:27:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16072)|
| 4:27:53| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16073)|
| 4:27:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16074)|
| 4:27:55| Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16075)|
| 4:27:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16077)|
| 4:27:58| Commissioner Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16078)|
| 4:28:01| I think there's a huge difference in this facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16081)|
| 4:28:04| and the one which we discussed earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16084)|
| 4:28:07| Some of these facilities, it's part of a parole program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16087)|
| 4:28:10| to be in a rehab situation, given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16090)|
| 4:28:13| that this is a voluntary system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16093)|
| 4:28:15| I'm like Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16095)|
| 4:28:18| I've had family members have gone through facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16098)|
| 4:28:22| like this, and they are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16102)|
| 4:28:25| But some of these facilities do have violent criminals in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16105)|
| 4:28:29| I hope this is not one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16109)|
| 4:28:31| So with that said, my vote is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16111)|
| 4:28:36| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16116)|
| 4:28:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16118)|

| 4:29:00| Applicant is Aaron S. Roberts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16140)|
| 4:29:03| Property is located on the west side of Palmer Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16143)|
| 4:29:05| north of Tillery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16145)|
| 4:29:08| Applicant is seeking approval of a two-family dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16148)|
| 4:29:12| The staff recommends approval of the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16152)|
| 4:29:14| for a two-family dwelling subject to three conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16154)|
| 4:29:18| This will require one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16158)|
| 4:29:21| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16161)|
| 4:29:24| Mr. Roberts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16164)|
| 4:29:31| Mr. Roberts, are you available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16171)|
| 4:29:37| Ms. Debbie Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16177)|
| 4:29:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16179)|
| 4:29:41| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16181)|
| 4:29:42| You have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16182)|
| 4:29:45| My name is Debbie Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16185)|
| 4:29:47| I reside at 1307 Michaels Lane, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16187)|
| 4:29:53| I'm a homeowner, and I live approximately 0.02 miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16193)|
| 4:30:00| from the proposed two-family duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16200)|
| 4:30:03| And I'm the vice president of the Norwood Homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16203)|
| 4:30:06| Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16206)|
| 4:30:07| And speaking on behalf of myself and the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16207)|
| 4:30:10| of this immediate area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16210)|
| 4:30:13| On the special use report, under the effect of proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16213)|
| 4:30:21| on the subject property surrounding the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16221)|
| 4:30:23| and community as a whole, it is stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16223)|
| 4:30:27| that they are no other two-family duplex dwellings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16227)|
| 4:30:31| on Harmony Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16231)|
| 4:30:32| Then further down under the conformity of the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16232)|
| 4:30:35| to criteria established by the city of Knoxville zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16235)|
| 4:30:39| order, it states the use is compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16239)|
| 4:30:43| with the character of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16243)|
| 4:30:45| where it is proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16245)|
| 4:30:47| Harmony Lane is a single-family dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16247)|
| 4:30:50| The entire neighborhood of this section of Norwood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16250)|
| 4:30:53| is single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16253)|
| 4:30:57| And as no duplexes to our knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16257)|
| 4:31:01| I have no knowledge of duplexes under the entire Norwood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16261)|
| 4:31:04| community that extends past Merchants Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16264)|
| 4:31:07| and to the Knox County line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16267)|
| 4:31:10| It is stated that the use will not significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16270)|
| 4:31:14| injure the value of adjacent properties, but it will injure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16274)|
| 4:31:19| It will decrease the value of a home around the duplex setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16279)|
| 4:31:22| smack dab in the middle of a single-family homes area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16282)|
| 4:31:28| Maybe not significantly, but to a degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16288)|
| 4:31:31| it will injure a property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16291)|
| 4:31:34| It also states the use will not draw additional traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16294)|
| 4:31:39| although residential or through the residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16299)|
| 4:31:43| Then the estimated traffic impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16303)|
| 4:31:45| is stated 28 average vehicles per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16305)|
| 4:31:51| Yes, the additional 28 vehicles will impact the residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16311)|
| 4:31:56| It is simple math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16316)|
| 4:31:58| With the lot currently vacant with zero impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16318)|
| 4:32:01| and then we increase it to average daily vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16321)|
| 4:32:05| trip of 28 in this proposed request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16325)|
| 4:32:09| We currently have more traffic than we can handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16329)|
| 4:32:12| In addition to the residents, many speeding vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16332)|
| 4:32:15| use Tillery as a cut through to avoid Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16335)|
| 4:32:19| We have roads where it's difficult to see to get on to Tillery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16339)|
| 4:32:23| such as Michaels Lane, Reeves, Harmony Lane, Harmony Road, Allen and Ferris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16343)|
| 4:32:31| This particular part of Harmony has a difficult time pulling out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16351)|
| 4:32:36| because of the visibility of cars coming around a sharp curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16356)|
| 4:32:39| on Tillery approaching Harmony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16359)|
| 4:32:42| Tillery starts at Bradshaw Garden, and it's difficult to pull out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16362)|
| 4:32:47| because you have people coming over a blind hill when you pull out into traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16367)|
| 4:32:51| The other end of Tillery and Wilson is impossible to pull out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16371)|
| 4:32:55| during rush hour traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16375)|
| 4:32:57| The intersection is usually avoided by the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16377)|
| 4:33:01| if turning left to go back to Clinton Highway during rush hour traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16381)|
| 4:33:05| This vacant land was a single family dwelling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16385)|
| 4:33:08| and it burnt down a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16388)|
| 4:33:11| Now we have to replace that one single family dwelling into a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16391)|
| 4:33:17| Allowing this duplex will set precedent for other duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16397)|
| 4:33:21| in the neighborhood on property that is or becomes vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16401)|
| 4:33:27| We do not need precedent set in this older single family community of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16407)|
| 4:33:33| It is not consistent with the established neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16413)|
| 4:33:36| will injure our property values and impact traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16416)|
| 4:33:41| Setting the precedent is not what single family homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16421)|
| 4:33:45| of this residential area are in favor of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16425)|
| 4:33:48| We're asking that the special use for this duplex on Harmony Lane be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16428)|
| 4:33:56| Thank you, Ms. Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16436)|
| 4:34:01| Commissioner Korbelek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16441)|
| 4:34:05| Yes, I wanted to share my sentiments about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16445)|
| 4:34:08| As far as the use, a duplex use goes, I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16448)|
| 4:34:13| But the elevation, the front elevation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16453)|
| 4:34:16| in no way harmonizes with the existing single family homes along that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16456)|
| 4:34:24| Like it would fit in, and I don't want to necessarily deny it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16464)|
| 4:34:29| but nor do I want to approve that particular elevation drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16469)|
| 4:34:34| Is it something that we could ask the applicant to redesign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16474)|
| 4:34:38| or what should I do here? I'm asking staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16478)|
| 4:34:45| Yes, Ms. Korbelek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16485)|
| 4:34:48| I worked with them a little bit to try to improve the front design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16488)|
| 4:34:52| that the city standards for duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16492)|
| 4:34:56| actually two family dwellings is what they call them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16496)|
| 4:34:59| does require a certain amount of transparency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16499)|
| 4:35:01| does require some kind of front porch element| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16501)|
| 4:35:06| or some other type of architectural feature on the front of the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16506)|
| 4:35:10| They did include the covered stoops to at least give it a covered porch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16510)|
| 4:35:17| and to accentuate the entrances to the units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16517)|
| 4:35:20| but the transparency already met the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16520)|
| 4:35:25| That is pretty minimal amount of work that they've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16525)|
| 4:35:29| to try to meet the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16529)|
| 4:35:31| and to have any type of character to the front of the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16531)|
| 4:35:37| I generally agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16537)|
| 4:35:38| I'm not necessarily a big fan of the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16538)|
| 4:35:41| From a minimum standard, they meet the minimum standard the city has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16541)|
| 4:35:47| At least in my opinion, they do meet the minimum standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16547)|
| 4:35:52| That doesn't mean it couldn't be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16552)|
| 4:35:56| If there's any type of suggestions you might have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16556)|
| 4:36:00| or any other commissioners might have on how to improve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16560)|
| 4:36:03| I think that'd be welcome if this is postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16563)|
| 4:36:10| just to give some direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16570)|
| 4:36:11| I would say I would be happy to give them my opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16571)|
| 4:36:14| on how that could be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16574)|
| 4:36:16| but I hope that answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16576)|
| 4:36:22| Yes, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16582)|
| 4:36:25| Chair recognizes Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16585)|
| 4:36:28| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16588)|
| 4:36:32| I have a hard time when we try and change the look and the feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16592)|
| 4:36:39| and the character of a neighborhood that is all single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16599)|
| 4:36:44| doesn't matter what it is, if it's all very consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16604)|
| 4:36:49| and then we're going to put one thing in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16609)|
| 4:36:54| that's not consistent with the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16614)|
| 4:36:57| Part of our job is to protect existing neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16617)|
| 4:37:01| and I think when we allow or vote for a duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16621)|
| 4:37:07| in a single family neighborhood, we're not doing our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16627)|
| 4:37:13| You can say, well, it's only one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16633)|
| 4:37:16| but it's one that's entirely different from everything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16636)|
| 4:37:23| and the fact that we're going to put Ms. Korbelik's question there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16643)|
| 4:37:33| she didn't like the look of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16653)|
| 4:37:35| Well, yeah, the answer was it meets the minimum standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16655)|
| 4:37:41| Well, so we're going to take an existing neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16661)|
| 4:37:44| and put the existing standard or the minimum standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16664)|
| 4:37:50| I'm sorry, put a minimum standard duplex in a single family neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16670)|
| 4:37:57| It just doesn't add up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16677)|
| 4:37:59| I'm opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16679)|
| 4:38:02| I was opposed to the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16682)|
| 4:38:05| That's when I had my hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16685)|
| 4:38:06| I didn't think we should put a duplex there either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16686)|
| 4:38:10| but I see a lot of other people want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16690)|
| 4:38:14| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16694)|
| 4:38:15| Thank you, Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16695)|
| 4:38:18| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scotsman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16698)|
| 4:38:21| You know, I don't know if it's because we've been sitting here for so many hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16701)|
| 4:38:25| but this thing, this duplex, it's really ugly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16705)|
| 4:38:31| I mean, I think we need to either deny it or postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16711)|
| 4:38:34| It's plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16714)|
| 4:38:35| It looks like a trailer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16715)|
| 4:38:36| I wouldn't want it in my neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16716)|
| 4:38:38| and so either let's postpone it and see something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16718)|
| 4:38:42| that complements the neighborhood or deny it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16722)|
| 4:38:45| because I agree with Dick and I agree with Sandra on their thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16725)|
| 4:38:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16730)|
| 4:38:51| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16731)|
| 4:38:55| I'm curious why this isn't going through the infill housing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16735)|
| 4:39:02| Say that again, Beth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16742)|
| 4:39:04| It's a question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16744)|
| 4:39:05| Does this not go through the infill housing review process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16745)|
| 4:39:09| No, it would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16749)|
| 4:39:10| This, the infill housing process is only for areas that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16750)|
| 4:39:14| the infill housing overlay district on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16754)|
| 4:39:16| and this area does not have the infill housing overlay zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16756)|
| 4:39:19| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16759)|
| 4:39:23| Commissioner Corbett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16763)|
| 4:39:25| Yes, I'd like to make a motion to postpone this application for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16765)|
| 4:39:31| and have staff correct them on how to just make it look better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16771)|
| 4:39:41| You know, I guess my concern there is that you start getting into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16781)|
| 4:39:45| very arbitrary decisions on appearance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16785)|
| 4:39:49| and I think the ultimate issue is it's one duplex in a single family area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16789)|
| 4:39:57| Is that appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16797)|
| 4:39:59| My personal opinion, no, but whether how it looks is really immaterial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16799)|
| 4:40:06| I can provide additional direction if that's helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16806)|
| 4:40:10| which would be some facade modulation and also more variety in the fenestration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16810)|
| 4:40:19| the windows and the porches just look like they're tagged on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16819)|
| 4:40:24| They're not making a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16824)|
| 4:40:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16828)|
| 4:40:29| So, Commissioner Easton, you have your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16829)|
| 4:40:37| You're muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16837)|
| 4:40:38| Sorry, I just forgot to take my hand down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16838)|
| 4:40:41| Commissioner Graff, you have your hand up still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16841)|
| 4:40:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16844)|
| 4:40:46| I don't think that we, as a commission, have any authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16846)|
| 4:40:51| as to how people design their projects other than the land development part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16851)|
| 4:40:59| What they build and how it looks is up to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16859)|
| 4:41:06| I would be against us trying to design a duplex or any building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16866)|
| 4:41:15| I just think it's not a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16875)|
| 4:41:18| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16878)|
| 4:41:21| Chair recognizes Commissioner Boston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16881)|
| 4:41:23| Thank you, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16883)|
| 4:41:26| I'm in agreement with Commissioner Graff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16886)|
| 4:41:30| I agree with everything he said so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16890)|
| 4:41:33| I just have a problem with changing the character of a neighborhood with a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16893)|
| 4:41:39| That's a single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16899)|
| 4:41:43| So, I wouldn't be able to support a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16903)|
| 4:41:47| I'm just against the entire project in this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16907)|
| 4:41:53| Thank you, Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16913)|
| 4:41:59| Did the motion get seconded or can I make another motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16919)|
| 4:42:03| It has not received a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16923)|
| 4:42:08| So, is it okay if I make a motion that's different or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16928)|
| 4:42:11| I guess I will say that the motion fails due to a lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16931)|
| 4:42:17| I would like to make a motion that we deny the request for a two-family dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16937)|
| 4:42:21| Uten, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16941)|
| 4:42:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16943)|
| 4:42:24| Motion by Commissioner Scott Smith, second by Commissioner Uten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16944)|
| 4:42:28| to deny the two-family dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16948)|
| 4:42:31| I call the roll, Ms. Edmonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16951)|
| 4:42:34| Commissioner Uten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16954)|
| 4:42:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16956)|
| 4:42:37| Commissioner Eason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16957)|
| 4:42:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16959)|
| 4:42:41| Commissioner Boston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16961)|

| 4:42:47| Commissioner Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16967)|
| 4:42:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16969)|
| 4:42:50| Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16970)|
| 4:42:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16972)|
| 4:42:53| Commissioner Browning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16973)|
| 4:42:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16975)|
| 4:42:56| Commissioner Crowder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16976)|
| 4:42:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16978)|
| 4:42:59| Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16979)|
| 4:43:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16981)|
| 4:43:02| Commissioner Graf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16982)|
| 4:43:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16983)|
| 4:43:05| Commissioner Corbillet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16985)|
| 4:43:08| I'd like to state that if the applicant had made it look more like a one-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16988)|
| 4:43:16| structure and fit into the neighborhood more, I think there would be more support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=16996)|
| 4:43:20| But given what we have to vote on, I would agree to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17000)|
| 4:43:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17005)|

| 4:43:51| Item 52 has been postponed for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17031)|
| 4:43:57| Is that correct, Ms. Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17037)|
| 4:43:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17039)|
| 4:44:01| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17041)|
| 4:44:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17042)|
| 4:44:03| Next item is item number 53.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17043)|
| 4:44:07| This is the election of officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17047)|
| 4:44:09| And I'll turn it over to Commissioner Beth Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17049)|
| 4:44:14| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17054)|
| 4:44:15| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17055)|
| 4:44:16| At the direction of the commission chair and executive committee, nominating committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17056)|
| 4:44:21| have been convened to identify a slate of nominees for the offices of chair and vice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17061)|
| 4:44:26| chair of the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17066)|
| 4:44:28| The nominating committee consisted of myself, Commissioner Graf, and Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17068)|
| 4:44:37| We present the following nominee for the position of chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17077)|
| 4:44:41| We have, we're presenting Commissioner Phillips to serve as chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17081)|
| 4:44:47| And so the floor is now open for additional nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17087)|
| 4:44:51| And I see no hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17091)|
| 4:44:59| And I hear no additional nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17099)|
| 4:45:02| And so if we have no additional nominees, do I have a motion that nomination cease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17102)|
| 4:45:07| A motion to cease nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17107)|
| 4:45:10| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17110)|
| 4:45:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17110)|

| 4:48:08| acclamation and to do the roll call, well, we can put this to bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17288)|

| 4:49:29| Thank you, Mr. Wise, for keeping us straight and legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17369)|
| 4:49:33| Next item is item number 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17373)|
| 4:49:36| Applicant is Knoxville-Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17376)|
| 4:49:39| Consideration of amending Article 3, Section 8, and 9b of the restated bylaws of the Knoxville-Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17379)|
| 4:49:47| County Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17387)|
| 4:49:50| Staff recommends approval of amendments to Article 3, Section 8, and 9b of the restated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17390)|
| 4:49:56| bylaws of the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17396)|
| 4:50:00| This will require one motion, and I'll turn this over to Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17400)|
| 4:50:14| Did this get removed from consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17414)|
| 4:50:16| It did get removed from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17416)|
| 4:50:17| So if there are commissioners who'd like to ask questions or make comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17417)|
| 4:50:23| I think that was Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17423)|
| 4:50:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17425)|
| 4:50:26| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17426)|
| 4:50:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17427)|
| 4:50:28| I know it's late, and I may have missed this yesterday because I had to leave a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17428)|
| 4:50:32| early, but on 9b, to streamline discussion, does everybody understand that we would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17432)|
| 4:50:40| the applicant not be allowed to have the decision to speak first or hear his opposition first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17440)|
| 4:50:49| Am I interpreting that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17449)|
| 4:50:50| Because I don't really like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17450)|
| 4:50:52| Does anybody agree with me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17452)|
| 4:50:54| That is correct, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17454)|
| 4:50:56| And this follows what county commission their policies have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17456)|
| 4:51:02| And this was actually brought up to Director Brooks in an email from a citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17462)|
| 4:51:11| And she and I talked about it and felt that it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17471)|
| 4:51:17| That allows everybody to hear what the actual request is up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17477)|
| 4:51:23| So those who are opposing it or supporting it can understand it on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17483)|
| 4:51:29| Right now, we go back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17489)|
| 4:51:30| Who goes first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17490)|
| 4:51:31| Who goes second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17491)|

| 4:51:32| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17492)|
| 4:51:34| Are you there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17494)|
| 4:51:35| Hello?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17495)|
| 4:51:36| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17496)|
| 4:51:38| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17498)|
| 4:51:40| So anyway, that's where it all generated from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17500)|
| 4:51:43| I'll let Amy discuss it if she cares to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17503)|
| 4:51:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17506)|
| 4:51:51| Chair Phillips, I think you covered it fairly well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17511)|
| 4:51:53| I will say that it does mirror what county commission and city council both do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17513)|
| 4:51:56| and how they handle speakers on agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17516)|
| 4:52:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17520)|
| 4:52:01| I just felt like it would be quicker if you heard the opposition first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17521)|
| 4:52:05| so you could get up and address it rather than spending time making your proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17525)|
| 4:52:09| then hearing the objections, then going back up and talking again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17529)|
| 4:52:13| And when the applicant, I don't know, pays the money is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17533)|
| 4:52:16| I just felt like he should have the flexibility to hear the opposition first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17536)|
| 4:52:23| The other part, that's the only thing that I'm against in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17543)|
| 4:52:26| So if nobody agrees with me, it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17546)|
| 4:52:28| But that's what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17548)|
| 4:52:31| I agree with you 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17551)|
| 4:52:34| You do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17554)|
| 4:52:34| I do too, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17554)|
| 4:52:35| So I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17555)|
| 4:52:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17560)|
| 4:52:40| So do we have a motion one way or the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17560)|
| 4:52:46| Could I make a motion that we postpone it for 30 days and split it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17566)|
| 4:52:53| Because I like the section eight part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17573)|
| 4:53:03| I don't know that you have to postpone it to split it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17583)|
| 4:53:05| I'll maybe, Mr. Wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17585)|
| 4:53:07| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17587)|
| 4:53:08| You can segregate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17588)|
| 4:53:09| If you want to approve section eight and postpone section 9b, that would be inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17589)|
| 4:53:14| Or two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17594)|
| 4:53:16| But you could even do it in one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17596)|
| 4:53:20| Can I make that motion that I would like to make a motion we approve the changes to section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17600)|
| 4:53:25| eight in the bylaws and that we postpone for 30 days section 9b for further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17605)|
| 4:53:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17613)|
| 4:53:35| We have a motion by Commissioner Scott Smith, seconded by Commissioner Roth to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17615)|
| 4:53:41| amendment to section eight and postpone 9b for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17621)|
| 4:53:48| Call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17628)|
| 4:53:50| Commissioner Uten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17630)|
| 4:53:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17631)|

| 4:53:57| Commissioner Dent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17637)|
| 4:53:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17639)|
| 4:54:00| And is it possible for us to have that discussion during our pre-agenda meeting next, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17640)|
| 4:54:06| next month's Tuesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17646)|
| 4:54:07| Or does it have to happen on Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17647)|
| 4:54:16| I'd like to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17656)|
| 4:54:17| I think she's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17657)|
| 4:54:18| Yeah, discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17658)|
| 4:54:19| When we're fresher, when it's earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17659)|
| 4:54:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17662)|
| 4:54:26| Commissioner Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=17666)|
