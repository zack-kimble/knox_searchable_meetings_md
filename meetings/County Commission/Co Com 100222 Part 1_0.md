| 0:04:11| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| I'd like to remove Item 102, honoring North Hills Garden Club, from consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| and place it at or near the top of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| Several members of that organization are here for the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=260)|
| 0:04:31| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| I've got three items that I'd like to speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| First, as some may have seen in the media this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=277)|
| 0:04:39| there is a program taking place in conjunction of the Knox County Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=279)|
| 0:04:47| the University of Tennessee, and some high school students this weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| at the University of Tennessee dealing with stress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| and how it affects individual high school students' lives, diet, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=294)|
| 0:05:04| I'd like to recommend people that would check into that call the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| The next thing is a twofer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| Sort of along the same lines, the Boys and Girls Clubs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=311)|
| 0:05:17| in connection with Knoxville Track Club, is sponsoring an 8K road race March 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=317)|
| 0:05:24| Sheriff Jones said that he would be there to make sure that I participated and that he would run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| Yeah, I see him back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=329)|
| 0:05:30| He's practicing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=330)|
| 0:05:31| He's going to run right along there with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| Benefit the Boys and Girls Clubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| And it's a twofer in that it helps the Boys and Girls Clubs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| and it also helps the person that participates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| That's the runner, the jogger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| You can look on the web at ktc.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| The third thing that I'd like to do is introduce a resolution, next resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=350)|
| 0:05:57| dealing with a current lawsuit that's proceeding through the courts here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| It deals with the downsizing of commission, if you want to look at it that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=362)|
| 0:06:10| the charter changes, if you want to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| Anyway, there is a lawsuit that exists in which I would like for County Commission to resolve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=374)|
| 0:06:22| that a resolution be achieved as expeditiously as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=382)|
| 0:06:30| I'm not speaking to the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| I'm just speaking as Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=392)|
| 0:06:38| us speaking to the lawyer that we commission have before the court representing Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=398)|
| 0:06:46| that this be moved along as quick as it could possibly move from that point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=406)|
| 0:06:51| the reason being because of the election cycle that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| If there's any questions, entertain them now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| but otherwise I'm just asking that a resolution be entered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| Commissioner Wright, I just have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| Commissioner Harmon over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| I'm not, by your resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| indicating any preference for the outcome of that suit merely that you'd like it to proceed quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=426)|
| 0:07:12| And like it to proceed quickly from the point of view of Knox County, not from the point of view of the bench.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| I think it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| They have different standards of time, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| I believe it's most of the fact is presented by both sides are on the bench.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=442)|
| 0:07:31| And the bench has its autonomy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| I fully grant it that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| I would just like to see commission ask that it move along as quick as possible from commission's point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=455)|
| 0:07:42| But we can discuss that when we get to the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=462)|
| 0:07:45| It's the resolution you want to be added today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=467)|

| 0:08:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| I'd like to move ordinance on first reading 102 up as far as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=532)|
| 0:08:59| We do have the director of KGIS here to talk to us about that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=539)|
| 0:09:05| And if we could hear it and allow him to get back to work, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| And I'd like to add those things that say to be added, withdraw those that say to be withdrawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=549)|
| 0:09:17| defer those that say defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| You have one more withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=560)|

| 0:09:24| One more withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=564)|
| 0:09:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| If there is anything that says to be withdrawn, then withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| Just catch all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| I would like to withdraw the item for discussion regarding the audit committee charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| We will, in fact, discuss that at the audit committee on March 2nd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| and bring it back to committee next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| But I would like to withdraw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| You want to withdraw it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| That's a misread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=589)|

| 0:09:53| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| Are we taking things off consent at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| I want to have 205 off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=597)|
| 0:10:06| Got some quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=606)|

| 0:10:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| We always read those in, so we'll get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=623)|

| 0:12:37| I have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| Mr. McIntyre or whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=762)|
| 0:13:00| How are you doing? I'm doing well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| I'm on your side. I believe in what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=785)|
| 0:13:12| I'm just concerned a little bit on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=792)|
| 0:13:17| what we're doing with the schools or this new school that we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| I've got needs in my area. I know commissioners, my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| in the next district, I think they even have even more needs. And just what concerns me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| is, you know, where are we on the radar screen? I've asked that once before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| You know, where are we? And your response was, you know, the school that I was in particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| was Adrian Burnett that's not even on there. And you've got your reasons for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| But I guess I would have liked to have probably somebody from the school board maybe come to us and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| here's our game plan. Here's what we're looking at. Here's what our need is. Because here's what I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| If we keep sending everything west, keep sending it west, everything's going to be down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| People in the north and everywhere else, we also pay taxes, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| And we've got needs. Adrian Burnett was a temporary school that was built 30 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| And, you know, we still haven't got it. We've got property that we've bought for Adrian Burnett School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| It's been sitting there. We've had it for 15 to 20 years. And if we're not going to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=857)|
| 0:14:22| you know, we're not getting any taxes off of it. If we're not going to build on it, then sell that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| and let's generate some tax dollars for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| But I just sort of want to know, you know, what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| And this might be a discussion that we could have with school people or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| maybe it's where I need to get somebody that's going to be a school board member that's going to be active| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| and is going to fight for the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| And because I know myself and Michelle Cairns and I, we'll both fight for the district to get new schools in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=884)|
| 0:14:51| But it's just sort of disheartening to see everything, you know, we keep throwing it west, keep throwing it west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| Everything is going to keep going that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| But people other places pay taxes, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| So I just, you know, concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| We can't tell you what to do with the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| You know, we approve your budget and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| But we just have concerns in our area, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| Mr. Chairman, thank you for the question and comment and opportunity to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| I would suggest to you respectfully that we do not keep throwing it west and throwing it west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| We have a comprehensive capital plan that we believe addresses the needs, the facility's needs of the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=922)|
| 0:15:30| Last year we came before you with a plan that was approved by the Board of Education for a one-year capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=930)|
| 0:15:38| that designated five capital priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| That included a new southwest Knox County elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| That included an environmentally friendly addition at Bell Morris Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| That included major renovations at Chilhowee Intermediate School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| It included the potential for a new stand-alone magnet technology high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=956)|
| 0:16:03| And it included substantial work at the Carter Elementary and Middle School campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| So those are the five major capital planning priority concepts that were approved by the Board last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=968)|
| 0:16:15| And what you'll see in a few weeks is, I hope, the recommendation that I've made to the Board of Education around a full capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=975)|
| 0:16:23| that really speaks to those five priorities in addition to all the other capital needs that we believe we need to address over the next three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=983)|
| 0:16:34| And when you look at that plan, you'll see that there are projects across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| And it isn't about whose district it's in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| It isn't about what board members are fighting or not fighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| It's about what are the needs that we have for our kids across the Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| and how do we prioritize those in terms of the need that's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| As you and I have talked about, Adrian Burnett, we had a structural engineer look at Adrian Burnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| That structural engineer told us that despite the fact that it may have been built as a temporary structure at a point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1017)|
| 0:17:04| if it's well-maintained, those wooden beams will last as long as steel girders, as long as it's well-maintained over a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1024)|
| 0:17:13| So that's our structural engineer telling us that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| So, you know, we take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| We try to be objective about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| We try to use data and do an analysis across our county to see what the needs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| And I believe our capital plan responds to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| Well, you know, Adrian Burnett still has got the two bathrooms, and, you know, there's just a major need for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| It was probably three or four superintendents before you even got here that purchased the property out there on Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1054)|
| 0:17:41| Do you have or are you all thinking you're going to use that on Tazewell Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| You think you'll sell it on Tazewell Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| I mean, we've had that for years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| Well, one of the things that we looked at last year when we had a capital conversation was to look at some of the properties that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| I think that's an ongoing conversation to say, are these properties that we think we're going to use over the long term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1075)|
| 0:18:01| If not, perhaps we should dispossess ourselves of some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| But if there's a possibility that we might use it down the line, obviously that's something you want to hold on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| because it would be very difficult once you sell a property to try to reclaim something like that later on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| or purchase a similar type of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| The prices obviously continue to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| When we look at this particular item that's before you, this is really about the projected growth that we see in the southwest sector of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1099)|
| 0:18:29| We project about 500 plus students in the next five or six years of an increase in that particular area of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1109)|
| 0:18:37| And so this is simply trying to respond to that need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| We believe we're going to see those students in large numbers in a short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| And so this is really about making sure we have a facility in which to educate those students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| I like what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| Take Brickey and maybe even Ridda, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| You've got nice flat land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| If you need to, you can expand off of that and make more positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| We've gone out there and looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| But I just get hit continuously from the PTA, PTSO, and the parents, you know, when are we going to get Adrian Burnett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1140)|
| 0:19:07| When are we going to get Adrian Burnett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| And here again is another school that's – I'm telling you what we're hearing out in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1149)|
| 0:19:15| And I know you're out there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| And just one other note on the capital plan that I recommended to the Board of Education that I hope and believe that they will adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1157)|
| 0:19:24| One of the other priorities that we have identified in there is Gresham Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| It's an older building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| It has some older internal systems in terms of HVAC and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| Don't you dare tear that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| Don't you dare tear that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| No, we're not talking about tearing it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| We're talking about doing some major work to renovate that building, to update and modernize the utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1180)|
| 0:19:46| and the systems that are in place in terms of heat and cooling and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| And that has kind of come onto the radar screen in the last year or so because of some of the maintenance issues that we face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| and some of the ongoing challenges that we face with that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| So that's another actually substantial, I guess, focus in our capital plan for the next fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1200)|
| 0:20:07| 11, 12 and 13 Gresham Middle School will also be on the table for that plan that you'll see very shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1207)|
| 0:20:14| Well, I'm going to vote for this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| I'm behind you on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| But I just want to keep it abreast to you that, you know, we're still patiently waiting on our turn too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1217)|
| 0:20:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| My comment has to do with 201 and 202.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| Some of the other people may be wanting to speak to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| I'll defer to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| I'll let them go ahead of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| We have all five of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| You want me to go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| Thank you, Dr. McIntosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| I am grateful for how you handled the situation last week and the tragedy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| and I'm sure it's been extraordinarily difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| So thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| This is fairly trivial probably in reference, in comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| But I did have a question about 201 and 202, the beverage contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1268)|
| 0:21:14| And my question just was when the staff and the board gets together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1274)|
| 0:21:21| and they talk about soft drink contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| it seems like there's an obvious conflict between health issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| and attendance and, I mean, attention spans, et cetera, et cetera, for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| So I just wanted you to why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| Why do we have soft drink dispensaries in our schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| Mr. Chairman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| Commissioner Orman, we have specific guidelines around nutritional standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| and what are in our vending machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| The contracts that you see are largely around beverage services for vending machines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| that might be in teachers' lounges or mostly in our high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| And even with that, you do have some guidelines around if a vending machine is in a school building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1323)|
| 0:22:11| when it can be on, when it can be turned on, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| So we have some specific nutritional guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| I mean, the issue of childhood obesity is a huge one across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| and particularly here in the state of Tennessee, it's an enormous challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| So we've put in place some fairly stringent nutritional guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| The contracts that you see here are really, we don't, I just want to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| we don't have a lot of Coke machines in our elementary schools waiting for kids to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| pop and get a Mountain Dew for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| It's really about different outside of school time and in teachers' lounges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| and things of that nature that we're really talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| And I would just go on the record, that's all I want to do is just bring it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| that I'm in opposition to children having soft drinks in schools, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| It's not good for anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| Back to 205, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| Is this coming out of your current school capital budget for the North Shore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| The school board authorized as part of last year's capital budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| and the commission on consent assented to $1.7 million for property acquisition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1395)|
| 0:23:22| for Southwest Knox County Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| Dr. McIntyre, I guess this is a grill your day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| We're going to grill you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| What I was going to ask you about, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| we bought some property up on John Sevier Highway several years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| for a new hopeful school in Gatton Creek, a new hopeful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| We've leased it to the rescue squad, I believe, for $100 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| Does that mean that that school is going to be off the burner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| And this was bought before you came here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| I don't have any current plans in the three-year capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| that I've presented to the school board that's before them now for their consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| There's no provision for a new, I knew, new hopeful elementary school in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| Again, we've had a structural engineer look at that facility as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| and while it, again, may have been built as a, quote-unquote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| temporary facility at a point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| it was built with all of the requirements for construction of a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| and the structural engineer, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| says that if we are able to maintain that in the manner it's meant to be maintained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| it will last a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| I've been up there several times, and they keep it in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| The custodians up there really keep that school in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| They do a great job there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| But what I'm concerned about, why are we buying this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| Now, you didn't do this, but why are we buying this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| like Commissioner Smith says, 15 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| And we bought this, I want to say, 10 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| and just sitting there and leasing it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| Why are we buying this property, investing the taxpayers' money in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| when possibly there's not going to be a school ever built there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| I would like for you, and like I say, you had nothing to do with any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| This is the only one you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| I would like for the school board to really take a good look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| instead of just going out and buying a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| and just sitting there for 15 or 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| If we don't need it, we need to buy it when the need arises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| instead of investing your money there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| You can use it in other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| We paid high price for that property on John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| I believe it's $100 a year we're getting out of it, and that's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| We never should have bought it in the first place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| if we're not going to build a school there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| Yes, I'd like for the mayor to come up for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| And, Mr. McIntyre, I'd like for you to stay right there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| Well, he's coming forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| You know, it's no secret that I started my political life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| in the conservative activist arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| And it's kind of nice to see now that a lot of folks are waking up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| and this Tea Party movement is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| These, you know, according to Newsweek, I think this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| about one in five folks identify themselves as a Tea Partier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| These are Democrats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| These are Republicans that are saying that government's lost credibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| that they don't trust us anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| One thing that Mr. McIntyre, I know you weren't here when the promise was made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| and I'm not sure that I remember it entirely correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| That's why I've asked the mayor to come up to refresh my memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| And I'm not going to ask these questions about my own district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| because I think my district has been very blessed when it comes to school projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| And I'm very thankful for the projects that we've got in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| But I seem to recall when we passed the first budget that I passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| when I first took this seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| I seem to recall an incident where a little girl placed a note in the mayor's pocket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1609)|
| 0:26:55| at a community meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| And if I remember correctly, the note said, we need a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| And was that Carter that her note was referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| It was Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| And if you just heard, Dr. McIntyre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| part of his capital plan at Carter Elementary School is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| It is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| It is going to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| It is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| And I plan on having her back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| And I wasn't calling you up to bust anybody's chops or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| I just want to make sure that one thing that I think that we need to do as government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| is we need to keep our promises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| And I remember that promise that you made to that little girl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| And I know I don't have much time left sitting in this seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| But for what time I'm here, I want to see that we keep that promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| I think we should as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| And believe me, I still have that newspaper clipping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| which is on the front page of the Knoxville News Sentinel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| that I see every day when I go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| One of the things that has slowed it down somewhat was when we changed superintendents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| we looked at whether we needed a new school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| or we should do a nice expansion and make the existing school work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| And Dr. McIntyre, I think, and his staff and his team have worked very hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| on looking at Carter Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| to make something special there for the citizens of that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| So I'm pleased that we're fulfilling that promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| Well, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| And I'm glad to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| And I'm going to vote for this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| Of course, you know, we're under injunction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| We pretty much have to pass everything the school board sends to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| But I just wanted you to know that the condition is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| And, Mr. McIntyre, I understand you weren't here when the promise was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| But the institution of Knox County Government made that promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| And I hope that you gentlemen will do everything you can to keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| Mr. Chairman, may I just speak as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| The mayor mentioned that we do have a substantial project for Carter Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| and Carter Middle School, and it really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| The proposal in our capital budget for fiscal years 11 through 13| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| includes a $5 million project in fiscal year 11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| that will substantially renovate the Carter Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| and also build a new Carter Middle School gymnasium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| So it's a substantial project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| It will do some work on the traffic flow on the campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| A couple of the designers came to the school board meeting the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| and it's a very elegant project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| and I think it will really make a huge difference in terms of the quality of the school building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| and the ability for the folks at Carter Elementary School and Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| to continue to provide an outstanding education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| And I want to thank the mayor and all of you because the design work was funded by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| So we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| We all seem to kind of be dancing around the elephant in the room here on 205.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| From what I understand, Dr. McIntyre, there were three properties looked at out west there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1790)|
| 0:29:51| There were multiple properties looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| We brought four options before the school board and the public to get input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1793)|
| 0:29:59| and this was my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| What sets this one above the other three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| A variety of factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| One is location, the fact that it is where so many of our students are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1808)|
| 0:30:15| and where we believe our students will be in the coming five to eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| It also has access to, because it's part of a development, it's relatively flat land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1820)|
| 0:30:26| It has access to utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| It has access to transportation corridor, which gives us future flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| if enrollment patterns change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| So it has a lot of advantages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| We're, I think, in a very nice position of having several viable options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| but I think this is the best of them, and that's why I made that recommendation to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| Well, basically, the school board is coming to us to rubber stamp this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| We can't vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| The commission can't vote to spend this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| You guys have already voted to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| So, anyway, I just want to be sure to clear it up that this is, in everybody's opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1860)|
| 0:31:07| because we've got a lot of emails anti to this particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| And I can't remember but one for it, this particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1873)|
| 0:31:19| So that was the reason I'm questioning, you know, was this looked at from every angle as far as these final four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1879)|
| 0:31:25| three or four that you narrowed it down to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| Are the people of the county getting their best bang for the buck out of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| Yes, sir, I believe they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| In fact, part of this structure of this is a substantial donation of land in addition to the purchase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1894)|
| 0:31:42| which I think makes it a very good deal for Knox County and the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| I believe we made this about as transparent and inclusive a process of procurement of land that you could make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1906)|
| 0:31:55| We asked for public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| We received public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| We had several meetings that focused on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| We gave an enormous amount of detail to the public about very specific information about pricing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| and amenities and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| And, again, I believe this is the best parcel of property for the Knox County schools for this school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| and I think it's a good deal for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| Commissioner Hallman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| Superintendent, I want to personally thank you for that very good session you did in Skip Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| You helped the community heal, and you paid tribute to some great people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1947)|
| 0:32:34| Just a few hours ago, Amy Brace, the assistant principal, released a media statement that I thought was profound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1954)|
| 0:32:41| and I want to just read a couple lines from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| As I continue the healing process, my prayers and energy are focused on Elisa Luna| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| and her family as she continues to recover, and the children and the staff at Inskip Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| I am so proud of the way they have handled the situation, the way the community has come together to love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| and care for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| To my children, know that I think about you every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| I love you so much, and I'll be back with you as soon as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| It's a beautiful note, and I just want to lead a round of applause for you, Amy Brace, and Elisa Luna| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| for the good and tremendous community of Inskip Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=1998)|
| 0:33:29| Am I dismissed, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=2009)|

| 0:33:32| Make sure you get your hall pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=2012)|

| 0:50:09| He's all the way in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| Would you like to come down and say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| I need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3015)|
| 0:50:21| Patrick Richmond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| I reside at 6609 East Emory Road with my wife Diane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3023)|
| 0:50:28| 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| And I hope I can serve my district the way they anticipate that I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| I do not intend to be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| I do want a school, actually two schools in my zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3040)|
| 0:50:45| I do not want a renovated school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| I want a brand new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| And I would like to see or I want to see the element deburdened, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3049)|
| 0:50:56| the Gibbs Middle School built that has long since been overdue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3056)|
| 0:51:02| and needs to be built immediately, not 5 or 10 years from now, not 5 or 10 years back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3062)|
| 0:51:09| It should have been built when the first parcel of land was built for that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| instead of paying for all the buses going hither and yon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| as well as in the Halls area needs a lot of work, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3079)|
| 0:51:25| And I realize other areas of the county need things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| but it's been far overlooked in District 8 of the needs for new schools in this zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3089)|
| 0:51:38| and I hope to see that that comes to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| If I could, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| Sir, you'll be contacted by Andy Concanon, the chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3105)|
| 0:51:49| to coordinate a date and time for a formal swearing-in ceremony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3113)|
| 0:51:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| Mr. Richmond, I told you that you work with my sister-in-law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3117)|
| 0:52:02| and I did contact her over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3122)|
| 0:52:05| And the one word that she continued to describe you as was that you had a lot of integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3125)|
| 0:52:13| And I know that's something that she would not just throw around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3133)|
| 0:52:18| No, definitely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| It's something that you would have had to have earned from her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| and I valued her judgment and I valued what you had to say the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| Along with the others, I think we had a very good slate of candidates here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| and I just appreciate you offering your name, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| Well, I guess my utterances in the back when I heard the final count was that miracles never cease to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3153)|
| 0:52:42| because I did not expect to beat at least two of my very worthy opponents, the lady I did not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3162)|
| 0:52:50| But to beat any of them was, to me, a miracle in itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3170)|
| 0:52:57| Well, I think it was very well deserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| 1-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| We need a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| Yes, we need a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3186)|

| 0:53:13| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| Now 1-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| 1-12, consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| to appoint to the Knox County Personnel Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| I've got two of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| Frances Fogerson, Knox County Human Resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| I would like to recommend the names of Deborah York and Logan Brummett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3215)|
| 0:53:40| This would be a reappointment of these two individuals who were previously approved by this commission in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3220)|
| 0:53:48| This would be a second term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| They're two-year terms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| Three-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| Three-year terms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| Except that one of them is Tom Hespas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3235)|
| 0:54:07| We have not had a personnel board hearing in five or six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| And so some of these appointments previously expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| For Ms. York, it would be until December 20th of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3253)|
| 0:54:19| And for Mr. Brummett, it would expire on December 20th, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| So while they're three-year terms, they have part of that time has already passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3264)|
| 0:54:31| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| Are there any limits maybe for the law department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| Are there any limits on numbers of terms or consecutive terms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| Two terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3284)|
| 0:54:45| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| Yes, just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| Did I hear you say that there hadn't been a personnel committee meeting in five or six years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| There has not been a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| Oh, a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| There has not been a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| I want to make sure I heard that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| For the last five or six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3298)|
| 0:54:59| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3299)|

| 1:03:20| We've been pretty aware of that as we've considered 9-1-1 Board, Parks Board, and some of the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| So I'll be glad to check, but I think it's more likely than not that none of these are beyond the second term appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3805)|
| 1:03:32| I'll make a motion to approve pending it's not the second term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3815)|
| 1:03:41| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| Mr. Pinkston has brought up a very interesting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| This is pending that they're not in their second term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| So I guess I need the law director here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| This is what if it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| I mean, then they have to bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| They have to bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| I said pending it's not their second term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| Then they'll have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| If it's just their second term that we're voting for, they'll be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| If it's not, they'll have to bring us back another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| Commissioner Luthold, the mayor advises me that they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| I didn't have enough background to go out on a limb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| but he advises me that this will be second term appointments for Dr. Hewitt and Mr. Stokes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3852)|
| 1:04:18| I just never had a nomination pending something before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| I just had questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| Drives and roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| Consideration of closure of unnamed right-of-way at Cedar Street and Alley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| Property located off of Olive Road and 2nd Drive in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3877)|

| 1:04:53| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3893)|

| 1:04:55| Property moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3900)|
| 1:05:01| My light is in reference to appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| If we could return to that as soon as this is finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| Go ahead, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| There's some confusion here that I've allowed to exist because I was confused myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3918)|
| 1:05:25| We need to revisit 1-10 if at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| Whatever means we have to revisit 1-10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| The appointment, Les Spitzer's name was entered in the minutes of the BZA as that he was resigning after this next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3934)|
| 1:05:49| So the appointment we just made, I need to make sure it's placing Kevin Murphy on the Board of Zoning Appeals in March or after the next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3949)|
| 1:06:02| not before the next meeting because I think that's the way it's recorded in the minutes of the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3962)|
| 1:06:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| In other words, the resolution that we just passed, 1-10, is appointing two people to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3975)|
| 1:06:21| And I now realize that there are different dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| In other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| One vacancy is not open is what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| Mr. Brown is being appointed because he has risen to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3992)|
| 1:06:37| He's being replaced because he is no longer on the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| But according to the minutes of the BZA, Mr. Spitzer is not leaving the BZA until after the meeting, which is this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4001)|
| 1:06:53| Can we not amend this, Mr. Chairman, to put Mr. Murphy in after March?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4013)|
| 1:07:00| Oh, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4020)|
| 1:07:01| I'll make a motion we need to amend it to do that, put him in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4021)|
| 1:07:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| In April?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4034)|
| 1:07:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| I understood Mr. Wright to say the other guy is not going to be resigned until after the March meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4036)|
| 1:07:21| According to the minutes of the BZA, Mr. Spitzer is not leaving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| is not off of the Board of Zoning Appeals until after the February meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4046)|
| 1:07:32| February meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| Well, if it's February meeting, he can go on in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| He's in February meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| They meet two days from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| Oh, they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4062)|
| 1:07:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| Then we'll put him on, make it March instead of April, amend it to make it March instead of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| Make it March 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| Because Ms. Stensel, she's not going to be on until March either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4069)|
| 1:07:56| They don't meet until March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| No, they meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4077)|
| 1:07:58| She'll be on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4078)|
| 1:07:59| No, she'll be on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| She can be seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4080)|
| 1:08:01| He'll be March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4081)|
| 1:08:02| Do we need a motion to that effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4082)|
| 1:08:06| Commissioner Wright, you've done a real good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| We'll make a motion to that effect that we'll go in in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4087)|
| 1:08:13| So to be safe and sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4093)|
| 1:08:14| I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| Who made the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| You second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| It ain't hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| Let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| I just had a procedural question as to whether or not we can legally nominate someone where there's not a vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4103)|
| 1:08:30| Technically, there is a vacancy, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| He is no longer on that seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| He's either there or he's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| I mean, it's either a vacancy or not a vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4122)|
| 1:08:48| But I think the best way to do it, if we're going to do it, is to just reconsider the whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4128)|
| 1:08:53| We've got to vote to reconsider, bring it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| and then re-vote on it if we really can proceed on with nominating someone for a seat that's not even vacant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4137)|
| 1:09:04| even if he intends to vacate it here in just a couple of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| And I'm only going on what I've heard are the minutes of the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4148)|
| 1:09:16| You want to make a motion to reconsider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| But just to keep that in mind, now, they're linked, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| First and eighth are linked at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| The resolution links them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4167)|
| 1:09:28| Yes, they link them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| That's why that's a reconsideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| Of the whole motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| Did you make a motion to reconsider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| I was waiting to see if we can technically nominate someone for a seat that's not even vacant yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4176)|
| 1:09:42| I mean, I just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| Well, our law director has ruled that it would be better just to reconsider and just do it, start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4183)|
| 1:09:48| Is that what you're saying, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| And then make a motion to reconsider 110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| Do you have something, Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4199)|
| 1:10:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4200)|
| 1:10:01| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4201)|
| 1:10:02| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| Does someone want to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| Well, first of all, we need to, since we redid all of 110, we need to start with the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4206)|
| 1:10:12| I will move that we appoint Cynthia Stancil to the BZA effective immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4212)|
| 1:10:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| Can I make a substitute real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| Commissioner Lutho, that was a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| Whatever you want to do to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| That was a substitute, too, that you put on there because we had a motion on the floor already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4225)|
| 1:10:31| That's a substitute motion we just voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| We had to vote to reconsider before your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| We had to vote to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| Right now we're getting into nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| But I want to make a motion that we separate the first district and the eighth district into separate motions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4238)|
| 1:10:46| so that we can vote on that knowing that that's one date and that the eighth district is a separate date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4246)|
| 1:10:53| And if you've made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4253)|

| 1:12:08| Motion carries. Seventeen to eighteen one. I think they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4328)|
| 1:12:17| think you should never come up I guess probably. One| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4337)|
| 1:12:24| four. Drives and rolls. But the public. Now we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4344)|
| 1:12:34| have. The public for Brad Mays. Before Brad comes down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4354)|
| 1:12:47| the ethics committee meets on March ten. And I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4367)|
| 1:12:52| one other thing. I was charged to get three commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| to the grant process. The arts will be. Commissioner will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4378)|
| 1:13:04| be on the arts will be a commissioner Lambert. On| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| the homeless will be commissioner Briggs. And on general service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4388)|
| 1:13:12| will be commissioner Amy brawls. Those were my three appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4392)|
| 1:13:16| and they have agreed to serve. And I thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| thank them for it. Ladies and gentlemen commission names Bradley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4400)|

| 1:13:29| Tennessee three seven nine three two. I suppose most of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| y'all are aware read the new Sentinel last weekend. At| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| the finance meeting last week I disclosed a. Another substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4417)|
| 1:13:41| amount of money. That had been mismanaged in our green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4421)|
| 1:13:45| waste department. And I was attempting to establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| something. Twofold in this particular issue. First it had happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4430)|
| 1:13:58| Which is admitted now that this happened that we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| paying for another county's green waste. Now of course. There| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| are going to be some people it's going to lay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| the blame of this on a deceased person. And the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4449)|
| 1:14:13| other parties not here to defend themselves. So I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4453)|
| 1:14:17| going to discuss that issue. What I'm here to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4457)|
| 1:14:23| Is the handling of the issue after it was discovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| The second fold of what I was trying to establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| in the history of the Oak Ridge green waste contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| Was that the administration. If they weren't aware of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4474)|
| 1:14:39| six or seven years ago they've definitely been aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| this for approximately two years. That means they were aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| of this. When they would come to this podium throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| 2008 and 2009. And tell Knox County Commission that nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4489)|
| 1:14:54| was wrong. They were aware of this through a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| to dismiss mediated settlements. And asking this body. To forgive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| debt and grant contract extensions. But they never told you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4503)|
| 1:15:07| about this little hiccup. Now fortunately. Mr. Vanderveet issued a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4507)|
| 1:15:13| letter where they admit they became aware of this almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| two years ago. Right in his letter. So I got the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| second half of this given to me on a golden platter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4522)|
| 1:15:26| So what I wanted to bring to your attention. Is and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4526)|
| 1:15:31| I'm aware that the mayor has now asked for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| to be audited. Two years after the administration found out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| In one month after Commissioner Smith got an audit put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| through that was going to be done anyway. But the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| thing that I wanted to point out is. There's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4544)|
| 1:15:49| lot of people that contact me recently. And they lay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| a lot of the blame on commission. They make generalized statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| about the county and in a whole. And I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4557)|
| 1:16:03| want to make it this statement from the podium. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| this commission or other people. Really don't carry the blame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| on this. Because it's like everything else I've seen in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| this case. They never give you the whole story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4575)|
| 1:16:21| They ask you to vote on these issues pertaining to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars. But they never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| tell you by the way that most was in fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| contaminated they did sell it to the public. They did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| get the green waste volumes these this claim turned out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| it was false and that claim turned out to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| false and oh and by the way there's several hundred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4596)|
| 1:16:39| other thousand dollars missing that we're just not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| volunteer to you but we now know that they knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| about. Folks where I grew up in the way I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| was taught. If you come up here and give somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| half truths and half stories that's a lot. So when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4611)|
| 1:16:56| Mr. Vanderbilt issued that letter and says we've known about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| this for two years. And they didn't know or they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4618)|
| 1:17:01| didn't know but either way somebody either lied to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| or they lied to you now. And this wasn't done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| by a low level employee. This wasn't done by somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| who didn't know better. This happens with department heads in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4630)|
| 1:17:14| the administration. Either the department head did not tell the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| mayor. Or the department had told the mayor he chose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4637)|
| 1:17:21| not to tell you. Regardless of which one decided to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4641)|
| 1:17:26| hold up the chain of information. You all were allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| to make discussions and votes uninformed. And that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4649)|
| 1:17:36| what makes this look so bad. It makes our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4656)|
| 1:17:40| look bad. When we found a problem. When we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| talking about having an audit done with Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| a month ago or two months ago. Or when we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| deliberating whether to forgive debt. They were aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4670)|
| 1:17:54| this. Don't you think it would have been a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| idea for somebody to raise their hand and say you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| commissioners should be informed of this. Because. And it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4678)|
| 1:18:03| your fault and these aren't my words but they made commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| as a whole look like you weren't doing your job. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4686)|
| 1:18:11| the way they make commission look. And the truth is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| they just didn't tell you everything. They told you what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| wanted their version of the truth to be. Folks there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| no two versions of the truth there's one version of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| the truth. Brad you have one minute. I'll keep that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4704)|
| 1:18:28| minute case there's any response I need to make. Are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4708)|
| 1:18:34| there any questions. Commissioner. Mr. Mays. Does any of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4714)|
| 1:18:41| have to do with the lawsuit that you have. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| purposely filed no lawsuit on the. Oak Ridge money. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| I also rescinded or retread back to the environmental lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4730)|
| 1:18:55| To allow for other agencies to investigate. This has nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4735)|
| 1:18:58| to do with the false claims case so you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| no lawsuits pending currently I have lawsuits but not that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| tie into Oak Ridge's green waste. But you have other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| lawsuits. Yes ma'am. And. What is your benefit from those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4748)|
| 1:19:14| lawsuits. Depending on your frame of view I can benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4754)|
| 1:19:19| from the false claims lawsuit financially. And I'm very open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| with that. But I would like to to point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4763)|
| 1:19:27| That for months before I filed that false claims lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4767)|
| 1:19:31| I tried to get your mayor to collect the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| And try to get your solid waste department to collect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| the money. I went met with rob mcconkie the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| director's office. I didn't file a lawsuit to make money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| I filed a lawsuit because I couldn't get your mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| office keister to go collect our cash. Well I might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| suggest that anything that has to do with the lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| you might want to confine to the courtroom. Instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4790)|
| 1:19:55| public forum. That might seem to be the better. Venue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| for that. Well this is not like I said relevant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4799)|
| 1:20:04| to the lawsuit. This is just relevant. This is relevant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4804)|
| 1:20:10| to respect that's deserved. To the 19 members that sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| on this board. Who's expected to make decisions. In the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| department has no pertinent information that would greatly affect those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| decisions they decide not to tell you. This is pertinent to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4822)|
| 1:20:28| an issue that I purposely did not follow litigation on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| This is pertinent to mismanagement of hundreds of thousands of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| dollars of my money that everybody wants to blame on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| someone who's no longer here. And it's hard for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| to grasp that because how did they budget the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| to pay for this. Who was reading these budgets for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4843)|
| 1:20:47| solid waste and overseeing the solid waste budget to notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| this large of an expenditure. Who who is not as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4850)|
| 1:20:55| simple as sneaking a contract by the mayor. The money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4855)|
| 1:21:00| has to come from somewhere. And the big question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| if nobody else was involved with this how come they didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4865)|
| 1:21:08| come forward they found out two years ago. How come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| they're waiting till after Commissioner Smith's motion to order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| an audit. I'm just. I'm here tonight. Because like every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4874)|
| 1:21:20| other month. This is not fair and open government. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4880)|
| 1:21:26| it's our money. And I come here and I'll tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4886)|
| 1:21:30| you the truth because nobody else is. I come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| and I do this and I research this on my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| time and my experience which is not my job. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| a lot of research I do will never benefit me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| financially such as the Oak Ridge contract research. But I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| do it because somebody in Knox County is not. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4905)|
| 1:21:50| disclosing to you all because somebody in Knox County isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| telling you what you should know. I disclose this because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4913)|
| 1:21:58| if I don't do it who will and when will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| it ever stop. Our county's 125 to $150,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4919)|
| 1:22:05| better off. Just from the thefts. The non collection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4925)|
| 1:22:09| of payments. And overpayments and things of that nature that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| have been stopped as a direct result of what I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| been doing and come into this podium. If I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| have never came to this podium it would still be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| going on today. And I think that's important. That coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4941)|
| 1:22:26| to this podium will save us that money indefinitely. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4946)|
| 1:22:31| these are the type of things that I have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| keep it on because there's still more issues to resolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4953)|
| 1:22:36| And they're never going to get stopped unless someone from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| the community. Takes on this responsibility and does it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4959)|
| 1:22:43| their own because engineering ain't doing it. I would volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4963)|
| 1:22:48| I would go as far as this. If county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| does not like for me to come to this podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| anymore. I will volunteer two days a month of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| time. And I will go to solid waste and I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| set some books up for them so they can keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| track of where our money is. I'll go there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| set it up. You can't find nothing over there. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| an outsider. Most people would qualify me as a dumb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4989)|
| 1:23:13| old uneducated redneck hick. But I found close to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4993)|
| 1:23:18| million dollars missing. In a department as an outsider. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=4998)|
| 1:23:25| know. If, if, if I could do anything that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5005)|
| 1:23:30| make a big result. I would volunteer two days a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| month of my time free of charge. I'd have nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| to benefit other than stopping this stuff. I tried for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5015)|
| 1:23:40| months. To get this stopped before I ever filed a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5020)|
| 1:23:44| lawsuit. The lawsuit was the last resort. Before I filed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5024)|
| 1:23:48| that lawsuit I went and talked to your mayor and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| he talked to me like dirt. I went and talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| to Rob McConkey of the law director's office. And nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5033)|
| 1:23:58| was happening. And our money kept disappearing every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| Thousands of dollars a month uncollected. Thousands of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| dollars being paid on invoices that weren't owed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5045)|
| 1:24:10| Brad we have. What else am I supposed to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| as a citizen. Commissioner Lambert. Mr. Law director I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5052)|
| 1:24:19| been following this situation with how we've been subsidizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| Oak Ridge. Do we have the authority to just Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5064)|
| 1:24:28| County send Oak Ridge a bill. For to reimburse us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| for the amount that we've subsidized them. Commissioner. I can't answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5072)|
| 1:24:41| that without doing some subsequent research I mean. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| have all the facts I have a lot of claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| in you and I don't have specific facts. Well I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| mean we start making demands of people that could lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| to further litigation and expose this board to liability I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| need to do some research. I mean here's my problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| I mean Oak Ridge has got a huge tax base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5100)|
| 1:25:03| out there. It's a relatively small community. And but they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5103)|
| 1:25:07| a small community with a huge tax base primarily based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5107)|
| 1:25:12| on D.O.E. government contractors. So we have this small rich| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5112)|
| 1:25:17| community with with all these wonderful plants out there paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5117)|
| 1:25:22| paying you know higher property taxes. And yet this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5122)|
| 1:25:26| we're a larger community. We have we have problems with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| our schools. I mean you know we've got this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| about do we build one out west first or do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| we rebuild Carter first. And while Knox County is struggling financially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5135)|
| 1:25:42| we have been subsidizing this community next to us that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5142)|
| 1:25:48| you know that that that seems to be you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| at least if you look at the way they you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| they're spending they spend a lot more per child you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| on their on their students than we do. And it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| looks like they can afford to if we're subsidizing their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5160)|
| 1:26:04| green waste disposal. And I'm just saying that there needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| to be some way we should be able to send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| them a bill for this. So I'm going to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| that as a motion that pending the law director making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| sure that it's legal I want to make the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| that Knox County send Oak Ridge a bill to reimburse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5180)|
| 1:26:24| us for the amount of money that we've subsidized them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| in their green waste disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| I will need a second. Do I hear a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5193)|
| 1:26:37| I hear a second Mr. Law Director can we add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| a motion at this time. Although it wasn't on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| agenda. According to your rules you can if the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5203)|
| 1:26:47| thirds of the commission agrees to have it added unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| there's an objection. Correct. Is there an objection to adding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| this to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5213)|
| 1:26:58| Hearing no objection then it's added. So just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| I would like to ask the law director I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| like to see this. Well I need I need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| resolve this and make sure we've got it properly added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| to the agenda before we can move on. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| don't hear an objection. Well now we're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| the two thirds vote at this. No no no. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| have without an objection it's added. There is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| objection it takes a two thirds vote to add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| For the purpose of getting a two thirds vote I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| will object. OK. I do have an objection to adding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5243)|
| 1:27:27| it to the agenda. So it'll take 13 votes. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| Two thirds to add this to the agenda. We are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5249)|
| 1:27:34| going to do that before we hear any more arguments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| because we know. But there could we discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5256)|
| 1:27:41| Or do you want to wait till we before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| can go forward on arguments pro or con to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5264)|
| 1:27:49| the motion. We need to vote on whether to even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| have it on. We're going to have it. OK. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5272)|
| 1:27:59| We're going to start in the first district as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| whether to add that on. Now you're voting whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| to have this added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5284)|

| 1:29:37| Commissioner Norman. Call vote yes. Commissioner Norman votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5377)|
| 1:29:42| yes. We have 14 yes, four no's, and one absent. So it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5382)|
| 1:29:58| added. All right. So now we're going to be discussing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5398)|
| 1:30:02| motion. All right. Commissioner Pinkston. Yes, I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5402)|
| 1:30:08| see the contract on that. And another thing I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| say, this is public forum. And Brad, you have the right to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5412)|
| 1:30:17| up here and talk about the weather if you want to. We can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| stop you. We don't have to ask you any questions, but we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| supposed to listen to you. Another thing I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5421)|
| 1:30:25| correct Commissioner Lambert on, Knox County pays more for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5425)|
| 1:30:31| students than Oak Ridge. It's just that we don't get the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5431)|
| 1:30:35| that the state sends them out there like they do us. But out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| of their tax dollars, Knox County pays more than Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5438)|
| 1:30:45| And Joe, I would like you to get us that contract as soon as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| possible. I want to see who can prove that, whether a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5448)|
| 1:30:52| commission voted on it or not. Well, yes, Mr. Chairman. My| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5452)|
| 1:30:54| point was that clearly it's not for me to debate whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5454)|
| 1:30:58| it's a good idea. I just want to make sure prior to us contacting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5458)|
| 1:31:01| another body politic and making a demand for monies, you're on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5461)|
| 1:31:04| solid legal ground for obvious reasons. And now, again, recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5464)|
| 1:31:08| that I'm the chief deputy law director. I have to ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| give this to Bill Lockett, the elected law director, who will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| make that ultimate determination how this should be approached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5474)|
| 1:31:18| But what I'm saying, this happened before I was here, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| I want to see if the commission voted on that to pay Oak Ridge's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| part. Commissioner Shouse, you did have your line on. Do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5484)|
| 1:31:30| still want to speak or not? It's not germane to this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| right now. Thank you. All right. We'll get back to you. Just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| turn your line on if you need. Commissioner McKenzie. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5496)|
| 1:31:41| you. Commissioner Pink's made a couple of good points. But let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5501)|
| 1:31:47| me, you know, kind of set things a little straight. And that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5507)|
| 1:31:53| what happens, I think, when we do things kind of on the fly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| like we're doing right now. Oak Ridge's plants don't pay property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5515)|
| 1:32:02| taxes. They have a payment in lieu of tax amount. I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5522)|
| 1:32:06| significant. I don't know what it is, but it's not property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| tax. So, you know, these statements get out there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| they get, you know, kind of out there as the truth as we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5531)|
| 1:32:14| it. And it might bias us in certain ways. Also, you know, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5534)|
| 1:32:18| terms of the school schools, Anderson County probably does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5538)|
| 1:32:25| pay a less portion of their monies than compared to Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5545)|
| 1:32:31| County. But you have Oak Ridge City Schools, which enhances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| that as well. But to this issue, I'm not in disagreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5554)|
| 1:32:40| with trying to get all this owed us. I think we should pursue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| that. But to demand it right now, we all know that there have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5563)|
| 1:32:49| been some issues with Mr. Evans and God rest his soul and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5569)|
| 1:32:54| contracts that he entered into. There's been some cloudiness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| that we've had to endure and deal with. So to make a demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5577)|
| 1:33:01| right now based on insufficient evidence, I don't think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5581)|
| 1:33:09| wise to do at this point. There's a process in place. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5589)|
| 1:33:13| think we need to pursue that. I think we need to give the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| director's office the direction to go in that route. But to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5596)|
| 1:33:21| pass an edict right now, a resolution right now to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5601)|
| 1:33:25| we want our money back, what does that mean right now? It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5605)|
| 1:33:29| doesn't mean a whole lot. So I'd rather just wait to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5609)|
| 1:33:33| what comes back. We've given our orders. We'll wait and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| what comes back. And then we can make additional moves at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| time. If I may interject for just a second, I think this will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| save everybody a lot of time. I know more about this case than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| anybody in this room. And I would respectfully agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5626)|
| 1:33:52| McKenzie. And I really appreciate Commissioner Lambert's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5632)|
| 1:33:57| suggestion. But I think before we send Oak Ridge a bill, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5637)|
| 1:34:02| best thing we should do is to put off that type of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| resolution for about 60 days so that we can better understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5645)|
| 1:34:10| the culpability and the parties involved before we go sending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5650)|
| 1:34:14| bills. The purpose of bringing this to your attention was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5654)|
| 1:34:21| twofold, as I said earlier. Just that it happened. They've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| known about it for at least a few years and they just didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5664)|
| 1:34:28| tell you and allowed you to vote on all this stuff. But as far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| as before we send Oak Ridge a bill, we need to find out, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5671)|
| 1:34:36| know, who all is involved and investigate this a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5676)|
| 1:34:40| further because Oak Ridge may be innocent in this. Brad, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5680)|
| 1:34:44| voted for that because I'd like to see Knox County get their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5684)|
| 1:34:47| money back. But if I was the mayor at Oak Ridge, I wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5687)|
| 1:34:51| send Knox County a nickel because he's got an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| there where we agreed to pay for it. So, I mean, we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| have a leg to stand on really. But I'll go along with anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5696)|
| 1:35:00| to try to get Knox County their money back. But I know we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5700)|
| 1:35:02| wasting their time. All right. Next on our list is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| Commissioner Broyles. Thank you. I agree completely with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5705)|
| 1:35:10| Commissioner Strickland. But I'd also like to say, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5710)|
| 1:35:15| Mr. McKenzie. I'm sorry. As you can tell, this is not my best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5715)|
| 1:35:20| day. Mr. Mays, I would like to agree with Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5720)|
| 1:35:26| Pinkston that you can come up here and discuss the weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| However, I would ask that you please be a bit more respectful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5729)|
| 1:35:34| when you do speak about our county employees. They work for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5734)|
| 1:35:39| you. They work for all of us. And they're at least entitled to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5739)|
| 1:35:43| a bit of respect when they're referred to in public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| just as you would expect us to treat you with respect while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5746)|
| 1:35:51| you're here speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5751)|
| 1:35:56| If I can just promote Commissioner Lambert. Yes. I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5756)|
| 1:36:01| concede to Brad's advice and I'll withdraw this for today. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5761)|
| 1:36:08| am very concerned and I do want us to look into this. If we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5768)|
| 1:36:13| been subsidizing another county, which at least according to Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| Barker's article, and I believe he's done his homework very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| well, it looks like we have been subsidizing another county. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| would like for us to take measures to get that money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5784)|
| 1:36:31| But if I've been premature in bringing this forward, then I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| will withdraw it at this time and bring it back at a more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| appropriate date, if the second will agree to that. I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5798)|
| 1:36:42| withdraw. So the second withdraws. I'll withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5802)|
| 1:36:46| Hearing no objections, it's been withdrawn. I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5806)|
| 1:36:50| respond to Ms. Brules respectfully. I am very aware that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5810)|
| 1:36:56| this sometimes makes other employees in the county as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5816)|
| 1:37:01| whole look bad. I'm very conscious of it. After the filing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5821)|
| 1:37:08| this case, after about six months into it, I became very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5828)|
| 1:37:11| conscious of some of the individuals involved with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5831)|
| 1:37:14| that are deceased because they can't tell their side and who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5834)|
| 1:37:18| all may have approved things. I'm very conscious that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5838)|
| 1:37:24| makes a lot of honest employees, which 99 percent of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5844)|
| 1:37:28| county is made up of very honest people who work behind the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5848)|
| 1:37:32| counters and many of them are my friends. The problem is I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5852)|
| 1:37:38| placed in a snafu when I know things are happening that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| wrong. And it's my personal belief it's a sin not to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5860)|
| 1:37:44| nothing about it. And since your mayor won't do anything, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5864)|
| 1:37:50| there's not much I can do other than this podium. I'll go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5870)|
| 1:37:56| the record and tell you that the majority of your solid waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5876)|
| 1:38:00| department without fail is some of the hardest working people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| and most underpaid people in this county. They go out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5882)|
| 1:38:06| and they deal with our trash every day. They're out there in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| the rain. They're out there when it's 100 degree weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5888)|
| 1:38:13| And they do their job and they do it honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| Mr. Mays, this isn't about the issues you're bringing forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5896)|
| 1:38:21| It's about how you are referring to people in government. Not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5901)|
| 1:38:26| just people who are in government, but just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5906)|
| 1:38:30| individuals who are in our community. That's what I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| objecting to. I was very respectful at the beginning of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5914)|
| 1:38:38| this and what I think was the turning points when someone sat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| across the street from my business for two months. When| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5920)|
| 1:38:44| someone started sending emails in my name using a Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| computer to attorneys involved in this case trying to sabotage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5927)|
| 1:38:51| it. These things happened. If this is not the proper forum to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5931)|
| 1:38:59| correct these type of issues, please tell me where it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5939)|
| 1:39:03| because nothing else works. I've had people on county time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5943)|
| 1:39:08| and county vehicles hide across the street from my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5948)|
| 1:39:12| I've had them send emails in my name and I've had them know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5952)|
| 1:39:17| contaminated mulch was sold to the public for an absolute fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| something that is not involved in the case anymore, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| warned nobody. And I remind you, this is something that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5962)|
| 1:39:27| experienced personally in 2006 when I bought mulch and I became| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5967)|
| 1:39:32| ill. And I can't prove the mulch made me sick or I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| prove that it didn't. But I had the mulch tested and it was hot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5974)|
| 1:39:38| as a firecracker and I got sick. In the same time frame that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5978)|
| 1:39:42| bought this material, TDEC was writing them warnings over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| selling mulch that had been sprayed with sewer water to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5986)|
| 1:39:48| public and nobody was warned and they were perfectly aware. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| this is another example. They're aware of problems. They don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| tell you. They don't tell the public. And I'm a victim of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5994)|
| 1:39:58| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| I believe you're misunderstanding my point, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| Mays. It's bring whatever issue forward you feel like you need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| to bring. But please do it in a more respectful manner to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6006)|
| 1:40:10| county employees and just to individual. These are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| individual citizens of Knox County. I don't think you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6012)|
| 1:40:16| appreciate someone doing the same thing to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6016)|
| 1:40:20| It's been done. Thank you. Commissioner Brakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6020)|
| 1:40:26| I was going to make a substitute motion, but I guess it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6026)|
| 1:40:29| withdrawn that I can't. I could not have voted for the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| that Commissioner Lambert made simply because we don't have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6033)|
| 1:40:36| contract and we really don't know what's in it. But what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| would like for us to do next month is to get a copy of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6039)|
| 1:40:42| contract, have the law office review it. I have a feeling, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6042)|
| 1:40:46| Brad probably knows this better than I or maybe than anyone at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| this point, is that the contract said that Oak Ridge would pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6049)|
| 1:40:53| so much for delivering so much per ton for delivering their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6053)|
| 1:40:57| green waste there. And then what happened after that was really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6057)|
| 1:41:01| didn't have anything at all to do with Oak Ridge. That may or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| may not be the case. But I'm very concerned that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6064)|
| 1:41:09| absolutely no legal leg to stand on because other than Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6069)|
| 1:41:14| delivering the green waste and paying what was ever in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| contract after that, it really didn't have anything at all to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6077)|
| 1:41:19| do with Oak Ridge. But we do need to have that reviewed. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6079)|
| 1:41:24| if there is some sort of legal recourse where we can collect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| money for our taxpayers, then we should do it. But I just have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6087)|
| 1:41:31| gut feeling that we don't have any leg to stand on and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6091)|
| 1:41:34| should not be sending any letters or bills or anything to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| Oak Ridge unless we do have a grievance that's not addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6097)|
| 1:41:42| in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6102)|
| 1:41:43| That's just exactly what I said a while ago, Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| But I still want a copy of that contract to read it and see who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6106)|
| 1:41:50| signed off on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6110)|
| 1:41:51| And so do I. And that's what I also want to know who approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| it, whether county commission voted on it or not. That's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| I'm asking from the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6116)|
| 1:41:57| Yeah. And I don't know if we need to. I agree with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| completely, Paul. And I think that what we may need to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| could we go ahead and make a formal motion that we have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| we can't really make a resolution without going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| that whole process again, but at least having the law director's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| office give us a report on that contract, exactly what's in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| And do we have any other recourse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| He said he'd get us a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| Right. Now, is there a way to expand that? Because I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| they also took some green waste from Maryville, Blount County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6142)|
| 1:42:26| someone like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6146)|
| 1:42:27| I'm just wondering how many other ticking kind of issues are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| Ask Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6151)|
| 1:42:32| Is there a way? Is there a way? Brad, yeah, I guess you're the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6152)|
| 1:42:37| best person to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6157)|
| 1:42:38| Was there any other? Were there any other municipalities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| I know TVA. I'm not worried about TVA, but just government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6160)|
| 1:42:44| In particular, I've checked with Maryville and they didn't send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6164)|
| 1:42:47| our green waste there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6167)|
| 1:42:48| We did receive some biosolids from Maryville for a short time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6172)|
| 1:42:53| That was negotiated directly between the contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6176)|
| 1:42:57| And the only issues that would involve Knox County subsidies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6177)|
| 1:43:03| with other governmental entities would be Oak Ridge, which we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6183)|
| 1:43:07| a net loss on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| There is another one that I haven't discussed a lot in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| of you because there is a litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| But just for disclosure, I have a litigation on this and it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| to do with the Knoxville Zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| And the story behind the zoo deal, and I went out and spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6198)|
| 1:43:21| with the zoo officials personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| I spoke with the director of the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| The zoo, I can assure you, is completely innocent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| And what happened is the zoo had been disposing of all of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6208)|
| 1:43:34| compost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6214)|
| 1:43:35| They make compost there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6215)|
| 1:43:36| They had been disposing of it for like $200 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| And the zoo was approached with a deal that if they sent the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6220)|
| 1:43:43| compost to Solway that they would take the compost for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6223)|
| 1:43:48| So it would save $200 a month by sending the free compost to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| Natural Resources in 2003 began billing us for the free compost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6234)|
| 1:44:00| And Knox County was paying Natural Resources to take free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6240)|
| 1:44:05| compost from the zoo, which we don't own the city zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6245)|
| 1:44:08| And the other problem was there was never a contract approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6248)|
| 1:44:11| for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6251)|
| 1:44:12| And that's a lot less of a financial hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6252)|
| 1:44:17| It's only about $60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6257)|
| 1:44:19| And I'm already, I think I've got the case put together to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| pursue and recoup that money for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6268)|
| 1:44:29| Brad, thank you for bringing all this to the attention of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6269)|
| 1:44:32| commission, the public, the administration, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| And you probably know, a week from tomorrow, the Audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| Committee meets, 830.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6277)|
| 1:44:39| And I think it's item, we've got to always have a full agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| but it's item 6, Knox County Solid Waste Department Audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6282)|
| 1:44:46| Need will be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6286)|
| 1:44:47| So we'll welcome you to come and give your reasons why we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6287)|
| 1:44:51| have an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6291)|
| 1:44:52| We know them, but we'd like to hear your reasons again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| So be sure and be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6294)|
| 1:44:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6296)|
| 1:44:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6297)|
| 1:44:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6298)|
| 1:44:59| I do not have anybody else on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| Was there anybody in the audience that wanted to speak a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6304)|
| 1:45:05| In that case, we'll just move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6305)|
| 1:45:10| Ordinance 102, consideration of an ordinance of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6310)|
| 1:45:19| of Knox County, Tennessee, placing on the ballot a charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6319)|

| 1:45:30| You said 102?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6330)|

| 1:45:37| Ordinance 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6337)|
| 1:45:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6338)|
| 1:45:39| Ordinance on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6339)|
| 1:45:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6340)|
| 1:45:41| Approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6341)|
| 1:45:42| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6342)|
| 1:45:43| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6343)|
| 1:45:44| Do approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6344)|
| 1:45:45| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6345)|
| 1:45:46| Can I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6348)|
| 1:45:49| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6349)|
| 1:45:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6351)|
| 1:45:52| I just needed to add in there, if the maker of the motion would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6352)|
| 1:45:55| agree, and since I'm the second, is that also the caption should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6355)|
| 1:45:59| say to not split voting precincts because right now the state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6359)|
| 1:46:08| allows for school, well, actually, when it comes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6368)|
| 1:46:12| commission districts, state law does not allow commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6372)|

| 1:46:21| So the commission district is made up of whole precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6381)|
| 1:46:24| It is silent when it comes to school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| And in the current school board districts that we have now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6387)|
| 1:46:33| there are split precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6393)|
| 1:46:36| Neighbors could be voting at the same location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6396)|
| 1:46:39| They have the same voting precinct, and one will vote for one school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6399)|
| 1:46:43| board member, and the other will vote for another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| And I think it becomes confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| So I do want that added to the caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6408)|
| 1:46:52| The law director has informed me that they were waiting for a response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6412)|
| 1:46:56| back from the election commission, the state election commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6416)|
| 1:46:59| before they put the final ordinance together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6419)|
| 1:47:03| So, but hopefully by the time we would get to second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6423)|
| 1:47:06| they would have that in place for us to read over and to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6426)|
| 1:47:10| So I'm going to ask that we go ahead and approve it on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6430)|
| 1:47:14| But before we then, John Gustin, John, you have brought someone here today to give us a little bit of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6434)|
| 1:47:23| Could you introduce them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6443)|
| 1:47:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6452)|
| 1:47:33| John Gustin, Knox County Office of Information Technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6453)|
| 1:47:36| One of the hats that I wear is that of GIS coordinator for Knox County Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6456)|
| 1:47:42| When Commissioner Luthold and I were discussing the best way to demonstrate what he was attempting to describe in this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6462)|
| 1:47:49| it became evident that printed maps may be a little bit more difficult to comprehend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6469)|
| 1:47:56| and to see exactly what he's discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6476)|
| 1:48:00| So I contacted Keith Stump, who is our director of KGIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| and asked him to prepare a very, very short couple of examples of what KGIS can do for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6484)|
| 1:48:10| And part of the reason for doing that was to give you an opportunity to observe what KGIS can do for you in workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6490)|
| 1:48:20| and with other questions of a geo nature that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6500)|
| 1:48:24| And with that, I'll turn this over to Keith Stump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6504)|
| 1:48:28| My name is Keith Stump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| I'm the director of the Knox County KEB, Geographic Information System, and KGIS for short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6510)|
| 1:48:38| We said that we didn't prepare any paper maps, but we actually do have some that we will pass out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6518)|
| 1:48:42| They're related to this issue a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6522)|
| 1:48:45| I'll have John go ahead and pass those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6525)|
| 1:48:49| We're going to go ahead and switch over your monitors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| and hopefully the overhead above to this laptop that I have set up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6531)|
| 1:49:06| Let's see if we can get this thing to display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6546)|
| 1:49:19| Let's make sure we have the F4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6559)|
| 1:49:35| Calling Brad Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6575)|
| 1:49:38| Could you help us out getting our laptop up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6578)|
| 1:49:44| He does it every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6584)|
| 1:49:45| He's good at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6585)|
| 1:49:48| We may have to resource the paper maps after all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| While we're waiting, may I pose a question to the assistant deputy law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6591)|
| 1:49:57| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6597)|
| 1:49:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6598)|
| 1:49:59| So I remember, and forgive me for not remembering the case citation, but a very famous voting rights case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6599)|
| 1:50:04| I think it was out of Texas, that held that legislative bodies had to have a representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6604)|
| 1:50:10| of Texas that held that legislative bodies had to have a very strict standard of the districts of bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6610)|
| 1:50:19| so they didn't have more, you know, some of them didn't have big populations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6619)|
| 1:50:22| some of them didn't have small populations, that they had to be very tightly apportioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6622)|
| 1:50:29| Forgive me for not remembering the name of the case, but do you recall that case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6629)|
| 1:50:33| and would that apply to the matter before us now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6633)|
| 1:50:38| I think it was Bell versus something, Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| I don't recall the case citation, but when I was reviewing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6640)|
| 1:50:44| that's one of the reasons why I wanted to seek some input from the state election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6644)|
| 1:50:49| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6649)|
| 1:50:50| Because the problem is the statute is silent, and likewise the charter is silent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6650)|
| 1:50:56| So to basically go down a new path, you're either inventing new law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6656)|
| 1:51:01| or you're acting in consonance with established precedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6661)|
| 1:51:04| and that's what I was hoping the state election commission can assist us with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6664)|
| 1:51:08| Well, I agree with that because I worry about running afoul of the law that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6668)|
| 1:51:13| even if we're only off by like 100 people because we didn't split a precinct or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6673)|
| 1:51:17| that could yield some legal problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6677)|
| 1:51:20| I don't want that to happen, and I want to make sure we're not putting ourselves in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6680)|
| 1:51:23| Well, first of all, this would not affect any current, the current districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6683)|
| 1:51:30| Right, it would go in after the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6690)|
| 1:51:31| It would only affect when they redraw the districts after they do the 2010 census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6691)|
| 1:51:38| So when they have to have it redrawn for the 2012 election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6698)|
| 1:51:43| they would just follow this as a guideline that they would not have districts that had split precincts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6703)|
| 1:51:49| and that they would be contiguous and as compact as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6709)|
| 1:51:53| And I would think that that would follow what that case would want us to do is to keep it as compact as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6713)|
| 1:52:00| But also as incredibly tight a margin as possible on the number of residents, voting residents per district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6720)|
| 1:52:06| Yeah, well, that's already part of the law anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| Just like when we went through the four, because we're going from 19 down to 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6728)|
| 1:52:13| and we had to redraw all the lines, and they had to fall within a certain percentage point of each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6733)|
| 1:52:19| All of that would still pertain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6739)|
| 1:52:22| Well, I don't think we're setting ourselves up for a problem, and I'm glad we're asking the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6742)|
| 1:52:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| I want to make, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6747)|
| 1:52:28| That was my first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6748)|
| 1:52:29| Can we legally do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6749)|
| 1:52:31| And I haven't heard anything that says that we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6751)|
| 1:52:36| So I would like to proceed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6756)|
| 1:52:38| If we do find out between now and, say, a second reading, then obviously we can just drop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6758)|
| 1:52:47| Craig, over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6767)|
| 1:52:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6769)|
| 1:52:50| Just while they're trying to get that thing to work, I was just going to make a comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6770)|
| 1:52:55| Have you discussed this with the school board any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6775)|
| 1:53:00| I mean, you always try to bring the involved parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6780)|
| 1:53:02| India Kincannon was here for the public hearing with the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6782)|
| 1:53:09| He had to go to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6789)|
| 1:53:10| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6790)|
| 1:53:11| He had to go to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6791)|
| 1:53:13| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6793)|
| 1:53:14| But she was here when we had the candidates for school board, and she asked me a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6794)|
| 1:53:20| And I told her, you know, she knows about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| And I'm assuming that the other school board members know we were going to have this on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| And obviously we're going to have to have a public hearing between now and second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6807)|
| 1:53:32| They'll have a chance to comment then along with the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6812)|
| 1:53:35| And let's hear what they have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6815)|
| 1:53:38| I'm just trying to get the ball rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| Since this is going to be something that's placed on the ballot, I would like to try to get that started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6820)|
| 1:53:45| But in case if we do agree on second reading to put it on, it is on time for the August election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6825)|
| 1:53:54| I think when we looked at some of this before, the reason they have some of these really odd school districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6834)|
| 1:54:01| the way they're drawn is if you tried to match them up, some schools would end up with four or five schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6841)|
| 1:54:06| and other board members with, you know, 13 or 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6846)|
| 1:54:10| It was some odd number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| And I, you know, I just want to be sure that we coordinate everything, you know, with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6852)|
| 1:54:17| It obviously is a hodgepodge of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6857)|
| 1:54:21| Well, let's get this off the table because this doesn't necessarily coordinate a school board with a member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6861)|
| 1:54:28| with a certain school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| What this does is it would prevent from saying a voting precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6870)|
| 1:54:38| It would prevent that part of that precinct votes for, say, the fifth district board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6878)|
| 1:54:46| and part of it votes for the fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6886)|
| 1:54:49| Instead, they would either all be fourth or fifth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| And that would go all the way through the county with all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6892)|
| 1:54:55| And I would think that would be less confusing for the voting public because you would have one neighbor voting for one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6895)|
| 1:55:02| school board member, and their neighbor is voting for another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6902)|
| 1:55:06| So I don't find that confusing, or I think they do find that confusing out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6906)|
| 1:55:12| Yeah, I mean, the only reason I mention it is that usually you would think you'd be voting for school board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6912)|
| 1:55:18| that represent the schools where your kids go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| Or at least somewhere in proximity, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| But, you know, that's not necessarily the case the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6924)|
| 1:55:28| There's no perfect system, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| And I agree with what you're doing, but there's just not going to be a perfect situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6930)|
| 1:55:36| Well, I think if we make them more compact and less of, you know, this sort of winding around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6936)|
| 1:55:46| then I think it will be better as far as trying to situate a school board person closer with the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6946)|
| 1:55:56| But do we have the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6956)|
| 1:56:00| Commissioner, I want to thank you for the opportunity to stand up here and tell you I could do things so much better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6960)|
| 1:56:04| and give you an opportunity to view this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6964)|
| 1:56:06| However, due to a dead laptop with all the data on it, I'll sit back down and let you all do your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6966)|
| 1:56:15| Let me first, before we pass on this job, this is hopefully not typical of what KJAS can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6975)|
| 1:56:22| And we are a city, county, and KUE employee, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6982)|
| 1:56:26| Keith, could you just briefly describe, as you looked at them, you know, maybe describe some of these printouts here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6986)|
| 1:56:33| Yeah, let me do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6993)|
| 1:56:34| What I'd like to do is just go over them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6994)|
| 1:56:35| I'm glad I prepared the paper maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6995)|
| 1:56:37| They actually came in handy today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| I actually gave three maps apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=6999)|
| 1:56:42| The one map is something you're probably very familiar with, and that's the county commission districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7002)|
| 1:56:47| your respective districts, and I think it reflects the latest boundary changes that were approved back in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7007)|
| 1:56:52| I guess, officially back in December timeframe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7012)|
| 1:56:55| You'll see on that map, not only does it show your county commission districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7015)|
| 1:57:00| but it also has the voting precincts that are respectively assigned to each of your districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7020)|
| 1:57:06| And what I was going to show you on the computer, on the laptop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7026)|
| 1:57:09| we were going to zoom into the map and show you some detail of how the voting precincts line up perfectly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7029)|
| 1:57:15| with the county commission districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| There's a one-to-one relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| Each voting precinct is assigned to one particular county commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7039)|
| 1:57:23| There's no overlap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| The second map that I provided to you is one with the Knox County School Board districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7045)|
| 1:57:33| and it should have a brown shading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7053)|
| 1:57:36| There are nine different respective county school, school board membership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7056)|
| 1:57:42| or school board member districts, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7062)|
| 1:57:45| Those closely correspond to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7065)|
| 1:57:48| For instance, if you look at the, I guess, the ninth district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7068)|
| 1:57:51| it's very closely aligned with Knox County Commission District 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7071)|
| 1:57:56| But if you were to look at the two maps kind of laid one on top of another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7076)|
| 1:58:02| you would see that the school board districts do not line up exactly with county commission districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7082)|
| 1:58:08| And if you pull up the third map, the one that should say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7088)|
| 1:58:13| I don't have it in front of me, but it should say something like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| Split voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7096)|
| 1:58:18| Are you talking about this map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7098)|
| 1:58:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7099)|
| 1:58:20| What's the heading say on that, Mr. Luther?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7100)|
| 1:58:22| This is Knox County split voting precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7105)|
| 1:58:26| That map shows the split voting precincts, and I think this is maybe what the issue was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7106)|
| 1:58:32| I don't know all the details about what the resolution was going to be today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7112)|
| 1:58:36| and what the discussion was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7116)|
| 1:58:38| But I actually posed a query, a question to the GIS data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| and I asked it to show me on the map all of the voting precincts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7122)|
| 1:58:47| that split across one or more county school board districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7127)|
| 1:58:52| And the best that I could ascertain, the GIS came back with seven different precincts that split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7132)|
| 1:58:59| And that's what's shown on that map in red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| It should be highlighted in red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| And the value of the GIS, not even to this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7143)|
| 1:59:07| but especially to subcommittees of the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| is that you can really zoom in and see the details of where these boundaries overlap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7150)|
| 1:59:14| because it's really hard to make out the issues at a generalized map such as the one in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7154)|
| 1:59:19| So that's kind of what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| And when it comes to the split precincts, I guess the authority for that would be Greg McKay or somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7161)|
| 1:59:27| But that's just typical of the types of information we have on the GIS system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7167)|
| 1:59:32| I appreciate you trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7172)|
| 1:59:33| And maybe when we have a second reading, you can have it for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7173)|
| 1:59:41| Mr. Chairman, I would just add that the case I finally found was Baker v. Carr 1962,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7181)|
| 1:59:50| and I'm sure our law director can look up relevant precedent related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7190)|
| 1:59:56| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7196)|
| 1:59:58| Oh, I just wanted to hear from Greg McKay about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7198)|
| 2:00:15| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7215)|
| 2:00:16| I'm Greg McKay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7216)|
| 2:00:17| I'm the administrator of elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7217)|
| 2:00:18| And I'm always glad to be of assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7218)|
| 2:00:20| I'm not really sure this is an election question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7220)|
| 2:00:23| My understanding that the school board, according to the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| is the one that chooses the districts for the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| But I'll be glad to help in any way I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7227)|
| 2:00:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7229)|
| 2:00:30| I guess what I'm asking is in terms of perhaps having to create new precincts instead of splitting precincts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7230)|
| 2:00:43| what kind of effect would this have on an election and the cost of an election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7243)|
| 2:00:50| Well, it would increase the cost of the election and the complexity of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7250)|
| 2:00:56| I would, well, I would just soon have voting centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| and then you could have all the split precincts you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| But absent that, I would rather have a split precinct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7260)|
| 2:01:05| which is a precinct where some of the people vote for one district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7265)|
| 2:01:09| and some of the people vote for another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7269)|
| 2:01:11| than be presented with a plan and saying, here, like they did in Daney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7271)|
| 2:01:16| take us three new precincts because we have to do it to make this plan work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7276)|
| 2:01:20| I would rather have split precincts than to have to create more precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7280)|
| 2:01:23| Creating more precincts costs more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| I need more officers, more workers, more machinery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7285)|
| 2:01:28| So I'm against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7288)|
| 2:01:29| So I'm, you know, our office is not in favor of any type of change in this regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7289)|
| 2:01:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7296)|
| 2:01:38| Can I respond to that, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7298)|
| 2:01:40| The commission did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7300)|
| 2:01:43| We have nine districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| We're required to have whole precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7305)|
| 2:01:49| School board, I don't see why they would feel like they can't come up with a plan that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7309)|
| 2:01:56| where they use whole precincts and would have to split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7316)|
| 2:02:00| If they wanted to, they could use, if they wanted to, the same districts exactly as commission came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7320)|
| 2:02:06| because we have to follow the exact same election laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7326)|
| 2:02:10| As far as, like what Mr. Mark Harmon said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7330)|
| 2:02:14| they have to fall within certain guidelines as far as being within the same size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7334)|
| 2:02:20| If they wish to adopt the exact same borders, they certainly have that right to or to come up with other plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7340)|
| 2:02:28| Mr. McKay, there were several proposed commission districts, were there not, during this last redistricting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7348)|
| 2:02:37| several different plans that fell, that were, that fall within the different guidelines as far as being within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7357)|
| 2:02:49| size range, were there not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7369)|
| 2:02:52| We had several proposed plans for the commission, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7372)|
| 2:02:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7375)|
| 2:02:57| They could have picked, they could pick any one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7377)|
| 2:03:00| It seems like we had, I don't know, 10, 12 different plans at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7380)|
| 2:03:10| I mean, so they don't even have to choose the same one and still fall within these guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7390)|
| 2:03:16| just stick with whole precincts instead of splitting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7396)|
| 2:03:20| It won't cost us anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7400)|
| 2:03:26| I mean, the burden is on us to come with a plan that has whole precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7406)|
| 2:03:32| Why shouldn't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7412)|
| 2:03:38| Commissioner, Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7418)|
| 2:03:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7421)|
| 2:03:42| Greg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7422)|
| 2:03:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7423)|
| 2:03:45| In the school board, the districts for the school board, they are sort of based around the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7425)|
| 2:03:50| have to be because of the number of students they have to split these students up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7430)|
| 2:03:53| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| Well, I think Dr. Briggs pointed that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7435)|
| 2:03:58| It's always been a point of confusion for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7438)|
| 2:04:01| So how come I have my kids going to one school and my school board for another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7441)|
| 2:04:04| It's virtually impossible to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7444)|
| 2:04:06| I think they try to do that as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7446)|
| 2:04:09| But with overlapping middle schools, elementary and high schools, plus your population considerations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7449)|
| 2:04:15| it is virtually impossible to set up a school district that exactly coincides with the schools in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7455)|
| 2:04:21| So there's always the people that, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7461)|
| 2:04:24| That's what I was getting at because county commission is strictly a different thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7464)|
| 2:04:29| It's based on population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7469)|
| 2:04:31| Each district has to have so many for the commissioner to have so many in their district, people in their district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7471)|
| 2:04:36| That's true with school board, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7476)|
| 2:04:37| So is the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7477)|
| 2:04:38| It's based on population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7478)|
| 2:04:39| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7479)|
| 2:04:40| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7480)|
| 2:04:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7481)|
| 2:04:42| But why it is split is because they may have a school here and the kids are over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7482)|
| 2:04:48| They've got to bring into there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7488)|
| 2:04:49| So that's really what splits them is what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7489)|
| 2:04:52| Gives them more flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7492)|
| 2:04:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7494)|
| 2:04:55| And I see no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7495)|
| 2:04:56| In other words, we're going to have to build a lot of schools if we change this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7496)|
| 2:04:58| It looks to me like I may be wrong, but I think they're going with the way they have to bring kids into school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7498)|
| 2:05:04| and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7504)|
| 2:05:05| You need a representative and it's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7505)|
| 2:05:07| I think it's going to be virtually impossible to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7507)|
| 2:05:12| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7512)|
| 2:05:16| With an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7516)|
| 2:05:17| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7517)|
| 2:05:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7519)|
| 2:05:20| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7520)|
| 2:05:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7521)|
| 2:05:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7522)|
| 2:05:23| This is the ordinance on first reading, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| Just an ordinance on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7525)|
| 2:05:26| First reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7526)|
| 2:05:27| Reveille with the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7527)|
| 2:05:28| How many no's were there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7528)|
| 2:05:29| Four no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7529)|
| 2:05:30| Did you have another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7530)|
| 2:05:31| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7531)|
| 2:05:32| I want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7532)|
| 2:05:33| We have to have a public hearing on this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7533)|

| 2:05:41| We've been told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7541)|
| 2:05:42| It's an ordinance on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7542)|
| 2:05:43| And we're asking that they place it on the ballot that would make the school board districts have to be contiguous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7543)|
| 2:05:50| compact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7550)|
| 2:05:51| But they also must be able to have a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7551)|
| 2:05:55| And that's what we're voting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7555)|

| 2:06:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7575)|
| 2:06:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7576)|
| 2:06:17| And explain exactly what we're voting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7577)|
| 2:06:18| And that's what we're voting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7578)|
| 2:06:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7579)|
| 2:06:20| And explain exactly what we're voting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7580)|
| 2:06:21| Commissioner Fondas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7581)|
| 2:06:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7582)|
| 2:06:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7583)|
| 2:06:24| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7584)|
| 2:06:25| While I agree with the sentiment of this, I'm having trouble because there is no ordinance here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7585)|
| 2:06:26| It's just a caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7586)|
| 2:06:27| And I guess I would like to see the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7587)|
| 2:06:28| Well, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7588)|
| 2:06:29| I mean, we're going to have to vote on this second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7589)|
| 2:06:30| And that will be in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7590)|
| 2:06:31| The law department was holding off until they actually got word from the state election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7591)|
| 2:06:32| commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7592)|
| 2:06:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7593)|
| 2:06:34| And then secondly, I would like a good bit of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7594)|
| 2:06:35| I mean, we're going to have to vote on this second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7595)|
| 2:06:36| And that will be in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7596)|
| 2:06:37| The law department was holding off until they actually got word from the state election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7597)|
| 2:06:38| commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7598)|
| 2:06:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7599)|
| 2:06:40| And then secondly, I would like a good bit of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7600)|
| 2:06:41| I mean, we're going to have to vote on this second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7601)|
| 2:06:42| And that will be in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7602)|
| 2:06:43| The law department was holding off until they actually got word from the state election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7603)|
| 2:06:47| commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7607)|
| 2:06:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7608)|
| 2:06:49| And then secondly, I would like a good bit of input from the school board and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7609)|
| 2:06:54| So I'm just not comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7614)|
| 2:06:55| And they'll have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7615)|
| 2:06:56| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7616)|
| 2:06:57| And they would have that opportunity at the public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7617)|
| 2:07:00| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7620)|
| 2:07:01| Mr. Chairman, if I could make, I don't know if this would be a friendly amendment or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7621)|
| 2:07:06| but I'd like to make a request that this public hearing be a joint public hearing between county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7626)|
| 2:07:11| commission and the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7631)|
| 2:07:12| That way the school board would be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7632)|
| 2:07:14| They would be a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7634)|
| 2:07:16| And they would be free to participate in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7636)|
| 2:07:19| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7639)|
| 2:07:24| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7644)|
| 2:07:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7645)|
| 2:07:26| I'm struggling with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7646)|
| 2:07:29| We're voting on the ordinance that doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7649)|
| 2:07:35| And we're going over things that the election commission is saying is virtually impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7655)|
| 2:07:45| And we have no idea what the fiduciary note of this ordinance is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7665)|
| 2:08:00| I'm going to introduce a substitute motion that we defer this for 30 days, allow the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7680)|
| 2:08:05| law department to dig into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7685)|
| 2:08:10| Election commission can also dig into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7690)|
| 2:08:13| You know, I understand this is first reading, but next month we're going to have an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7693)|
| 2:08:18| again, that doesn't exist today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7698)|
| 2:08:21| So it's not, we're not really having time to dig into what this actually says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7701)|
| 2:08:25| Some of this I agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7705)|
| 2:08:26| Some of the things I disagree with, the way it's worded, and just a little caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7706)|
| 2:08:30| So could we make haste slowly in this particular case and defer this for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7710)|
| 2:08:39| I don't mind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7719)|
| 2:08:40| I just, since it is going to, we're trying to get it on the ballot, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7720)|
| 2:08:45| McKay, Greg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7725)|
| 2:08:48| If we deferred this until next month, and then, of course, it would have to have, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7728)|
| 2:08:52| that would be March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7732)|
| 2:08:55| So we'd have to vote on it March and April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7735)|
| 2:08:57| Will that still get us on the ballot in time for August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7737)|
| 2:09:01| Does that start getting into, would you get it in time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7741)|
| 2:09:08| I'm looking to the law department for help here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7748)|
| 2:09:13| At first blush it would seem that way, but I don't think there's any kind of deadline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7753)|
| 2:09:17| as far as, I mean, we need it 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7757)|
| 2:09:22| We need it 60 days out of an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7762)|
| 2:09:26| So that would be in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7766)|
| 2:09:27| For August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7767)|
| 2:09:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7768)|
| 2:09:29| For August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7769)|
| 2:09:30| And if we needed to, we could go to November even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7770)|
| 2:09:32| Because it just needs to be voted on in time to affect the next drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7772)|
| 2:09:38| Good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7778)|
| 2:09:41| I don't mind deferring for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7781)|
| 2:09:43| I second the motion to defer 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7783)|
| 2:09:46| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7786)|
| 2:09:47| Substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7787)|
| 2:09:48| Do you have something on it, Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7788)|
| 2:09:51| I just wanted to point out that our finance department is required now to do a financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7791)|
| 2:09:58| impact study between first and second reading on ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7798)|
| 2:10:01| So we would have a good idea by the second reading how much this would cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7801)|
| 2:10:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7807)|
| 2:10:08| I'm just going to just reiterate again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7808)|
| 2:10:10| I disagree with our election commission administrator that we would have to split our districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7810)|
| 2:10:17| precincts, because we do it with this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7817)|
| 2:10:21| We had nearly a dozen different proposals that met all the election laws for nine districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7821)|
| 2:10:30| that the school board could come up with, I'm sure, others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7830)|
| 2:10:37| We have a substitute motion on the floor to defer to next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7837)|
| 2:10:41| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7841)|
| 2:10:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7843)|
| 2:10:44| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7844)|
| 2:10:45| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| Going back to 602.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7847)|
| 2:10:51| I think it's on page 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7851)|
| 2:10:54| 602, consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7854)|
| 2:10:58| approving a contract in the amount of $970,300 with University Pathologist PC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7858)|

| 2:11:18| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7878)|
| 2:11:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7879)|
| 2:11:20| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7880)|
| 2:11:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7883)|
| 2:11:24| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7884)|
| 2:11:25| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7887)|
| 2:11:29| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7889)|
| 2:11:31| Was this contract bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7891)|
| 2:11:35| This what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7895)|
| 2:11:37| This was bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7897)|
| 2:11:39| There was an RFQ released on this, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7899)|
| 2:11:43| This is a professional services contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7903)|
| 2:11:45| that merely requires the county to do requests for qualifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7905)|
| 2:11:49| not a request for proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7909)|
| 2:11:54| Do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7914)|
| 2:11:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7915)|
| 2:11:56| I'm just concerned with a few questions in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7916)|
| 2:12:00| Me and Mr. Jones have spoken, and I've spoken to Dr. Van Meter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7920)|
| 2:12:04| We've had a good conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7924)|
| 2:12:05| but I'm still hesitant to vote on a 45-page document and contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7925)|
| 2:12:11| I think there's still some questions that some of the employees have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7931)|
| 2:12:15| and I'd like to defer for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7935)|
| 2:12:17| if we could make a substitute motion to defer for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7937)|
| 2:12:20| to go over some of those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7940)|
| 2:12:22| We just got this contract Friday afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7942)|
| 2:12:24| and I'd prefer a 30-day deferment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7944)|
| 2:12:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7949)|
| 2:12:33| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7953)|
| 2:12:34| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7954)|
| 2:12:37| Yes, I think Dr. Van Meter is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7957)|
| 2:12:41| Do you have a problem with us deferring this 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7961)|
| 2:12:46| Does this hurt you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7966)|
| 2:12:48| or does this change anything that's, you know, pending in the center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7968)|
| 2:12:57| Stuart Van Meter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7977)|
| 2:12:58| I'm 8700 Darien Court, Fourth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7978)|
| 2:13:02| I'm the president of University Pathologist PC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7982)|
| 2:13:05| also the chairman of the Department of Pathology at UT Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7985)|
| 2:13:10| In terms of 30 days, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7990)|
| 2:13:13| I can't say that there's any meaningful effect that would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7993)|
| 2:13:18| It had been anticipated that this contract would go into effect April 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=7998)|
| 2:13:25| That's not a hard deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8005)|
| 2:13:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8007)|
| 2:13:28| I just wanted to be sure there wasn't some sort of certification process that goes on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8008)|
| 2:13:31| that requires this that would end up putting you behind the eight ball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8011)|
| 2:13:34| so that's okay with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8014)|
| 2:13:35| This doesn't harm accreditation or anything, Dr. Van Meter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8015)|
| 2:13:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8018)|
| 2:13:39| Can I just say one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8019)|
| 2:13:42| Frances Fogerson and I did meet with the employees last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8022)|
| 2:13:45| We had a chance to sit down with the medical examiner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8025)|
| 2:13:48| and Dr. Van Meter to go over everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8028)|
| 2:13:50| So we've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8030)|
| 2:13:51| And at the end of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8031)|
| 2:13:53| I asked the employees if there was anything else that we needed to discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8033)|
| 2:13:57| anything about the benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8037)|
| 2:13:59| anything about the transition on employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8039)|
| 2:14:02| And I left with the belief that we had answered the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8042)|
| 2:14:06| I know that Dr. Van Meter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8046)|
| 2:14:08| and University Physicians Associates had also met with the employees, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8048)|
| 2:14:14| So I don't know anything else that we can communicate with them about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8054)|
| 2:14:21| Yeah, I just had some questions come up to me over the weekend from one or two employees, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8061)|
| 2:14:27| that were just scared of the being sold to a private vendor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8067)|
| 2:14:31| and just had some comfort issues with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8071)|
| 2:14:34| And they'd like to go over some more of that hopefully with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8074)|
| 2:14:38| and just feel more comfortable with the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8078)|
| 2:14:43| And if it's not going to hurt any accreditation process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8083)|
| 2:14:47| and it's not going to hurt as long as everybody's comfortable with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8087)|
| 2:14:50| we want to be comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8090)|
| 2:14:55| Something else, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8095)|
| 2:14:57| I just had another comment for some who may not be quite as aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8097)|
| 2:15:02| And I think I'm accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8102)|
| 2:15:03| If I'm not, feel free to correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| But we had an audit a couple of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8105)|
| 2:15:09| and it was really a confusing situation about which employees worked for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8109)|
| 2:15:14| and which didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8114)|
| 2:15:15| And some of them were doing work that really didn't pertain to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8115)|
| 2:15:18| And what's changing here is that the contract is actually with University Pathology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8118)|
| 2:15:23| And so these people will all become University Pathology employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8123)|
| 2:15:26| and it's now their responsibility to hire the people they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8126)|
| 2:15:32| If they need to hire another pathologist, that's their responsibility under this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8132)|
| 2:15:37| And it sort of does away with some of the piecemealing, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8137)|
| 2:15:41| of the financial situation for the center, if I'm correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8141)|
| 2:15:50| If I might offer just a little bit of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8150)|
| 2:15:53| And many of you will recall the operational audit performed in 2008 of the Forensic Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8153)|
| 2:16:00| And it was recommended at that time that privatization of the center be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8160)|
| 2:16:09| similar to as done in Davidson County and Shelby County currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8169)|
| 2:16:15| By virtue of the fact that the Regional Forensic Center occupies space in UT Medical Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8175)|
| 2:16:21| by its very nature it has to serve multiple entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8181)|
| 2:16:27| Knox County, very importantly, also UT Medical Center and our residency training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8187)|
| 2:16:36| It is funded from multiple sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8196)|
| 2:16:39| And that creates some mixing of funds, some mixing of responsibilities among the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8199)|
| 2:16:47| And this contract is an attempt to help resolve that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8207)|
| 2:16:56| There really is no other entity other than University Pathologist that's in a position to act as that umbrella.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8216)|
| 2:17:05| Neither the county can do this, nor can UT Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8225)|
| 2:17:10| A lot of thought has gone into this and a lot of work over a couple of years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8230)|
| 2:17:15| And I hope we're close to a resolution on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8235)|
| 2:17:19| I think it's also important for the commission to know, and you pointed it out to me in the conversation that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8239)|
| 2:17:25| is that under the new leadership of the chief medical examiner, I guess that's her title,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8245)|
| 2:17:30| is that things really are running pretty well and we haven't had some of the issues that we had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8250)|
| 2:17:38| I think probably everyone here is aware the medical examiner's office is running extremely smoothly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8258)|
| 2:17:45| and is very effective under Dr. Mlucinic's leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8265)|
| 2:17:49| University Pathologist is committed to retaining all of the current employees at their current salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8269)|
| 2:17:57| and attempting to match benefits as closely as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8277)|
| 2:18:01| There are three full-time salaried employees on the county payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8281)|
| 2:18:07| There are, I believe, two other full-time hourly employees and then a handful of part-time employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8287)|
| 2:18:14| That's the scope of the numbers of employees that we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8294)|
| 2:18:23| We have a substitute motion on the floor to defer to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8303)|
| 2:18:29| All in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8309)|
| 2:18:32| Opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8312)|
| 2:18:35| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8315)|
| 2:18:38| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8318)|
| 2:18:40| 18-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8320)|
| 2:18:46| 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8326)|
| 2:18:49| Motion of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8329)|
| 2:18:52| precluding ousted Knox County commissioners from serving on boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8332)|
| 2:18:57| and committees appointed by the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8337)|
| 2:19:00| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8340)|
| 2:19:02| Finance, 8-1, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8342)|
| 2:19:05| Governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8345)|
| 2:19:06| 8-1, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8346)|
| 2:19:08| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8348)|
| 2:19:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8351)|
| 2:19:12| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8352)|
| 2:19:16| Motion to approve, if I'm not being clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8356)|
| 2:19:22| Do we have questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8362)|
| 2:19:25| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8365)|
| 2:19:27| I would like to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8367)|
| 2:19:29| Unfortunately, I was unable to be at the committee meeting last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8369)|
| 2:19:34| although I did get to read what was in the papers afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8374)|
| 2:19:38| And I'm afraid this has been misconstrued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8378)|
| 2:19:42| This has nothing to do with Mr. Moore and the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8382)|
| 2:19:46| If it did, I would have simply submitted a resolution to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8386)|
| 2:19:51| This has to do with whether or not we're going to continue to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8391)|
| 2:19:54| with creating a respectable county government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8394)|
| 2:19:58| or whether we're going to continue to operate by the old boy system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8398)|
| 2:20:03| or whatever you want to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8403)|
| 2:20:06| So that's what this was about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8406)|
| 2:20:09| This was what some of my constituents asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8409)|
| 2:20:13| and I'm happy to represent them on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8413)|
| 2:20:17| Commissioner Schaaf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8417)|
| 2:20:19| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8419)|
| 2:20:20| Do we have a definitive answer to the question Dr. Briggs raised about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8420)|
| 2:20:24| ex post facto issue at the committee meetings last Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8424)|
| 2:20:30| that being changing the rules after something happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8430)|
| 2:20:34| like I drove in here at 70 on the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8434)|
| 2:20:37| or, excuse me, driving 50 on the interstate and, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8437)|
| 2:20:41| speed limit is 45, so you're guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8441)|
| 2:20:43| That's just my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8443)|
| 2:20:45| Sir, if I could, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8445)|
| 2:20:47| You have to distinguish between those boards under which you have appointed power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8447)|
| 2:20:51| under the charter or the code and those that are creatures of statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8451)|
| 2:20:55| Under your code, you have the authority by resolution to remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8455)|
| 2:20:58| and discharge anyone you appoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8458)|
| 2:21:01| However, if you're dealing with a board where in the state has preemptive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8461)|
| 2:21:05| such as a BZA, you can remove someone for cause upon written charges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8465)|
| 2:21:11| and after a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8471)|
| 2:21:13| So the bottom line is in terms of it being retroactive or ex post facto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8473)|
| 2:21:17| the bottom line is if it is a state appointed board like BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8477)|
| 2:21:21| which empowers you to create a BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| you could at any time inform the member in question in writing that they're about to be discharged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8483)|
| 2:21:30| then you give them a public hearing, and then if the board votes, they're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8490)|
| 2:21:33| If it's anybody else, you do a resolution, they're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8493)|
| 2:21:36| So regardless of what you pass today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8496)|
| 2:21:38| you already have the authority to remove people from your appointed boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8498)|
| 2:21:46| And, again, I'm not interested in anything retroactively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8506)|
| 2:21:50| I'm looking forward to the health of Knox County Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8510)|
| 2:21:56| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8516)|
| 2:21:58| I understand that, and I appreciate that, Mrs. Burroughs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8518)|
| 2:22:01| but we already have the power even later on if someone comes up here that has been ousted from commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8521)|
| 2:22:08| or something to turn them down, not appoint them because we make those appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8528)|
| 2:22:13| What I'm concerned about is someone making a mistake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8533)|
| 2:22:17| should we punish them for the rest of their life that they can't serve on any kind of boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8537)|
| 2:22:21| or committees or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8541)|
| 2:22:24| You know, that really concerns me when you already have the power as a commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8544)|
| 2:22:28| whoever the commission would be if someone like that come for them, to turn them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8548)|
| 2:22:32| That's just, you know, that's a little bit stout, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8552)|
| 2:22:36| when you're covering commissioners, you know, on boards and committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8556)|
| 2:22:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8560)|
| 2:22:41| I understand your concern, and I don't think it's that we're turning them down once they've applied for something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8561)|
| 2:22:47| after they've been ousted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8567)|
| 2:22:49| Once they've been ousted from commission, then, as Mr. Jarrett was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8569)|
| 2:22:56| we have to go through what could be a somewhat lengthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8576)|
| 2:22:59| and embarrassing process to remove them from boards that they've been appointed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8579)|
| 2:23:05| This would make it happen automatically with no further embarrassment to them or to their family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8585)|
| 2:23:11| If someone has been ousted from commission, they've been ousted for a pretty serious reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8591)|
| 2:23:17| and I think that the people in those districts deserve to have better representation on those boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8597)|
| 2:23:24| than a commissioner who's been ousted for something that is quite serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8604)|
| 2:23:31| Well, do you think if someone is ousted for something that wasn't too serious, if they were ousted, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8611)|
| 2:23:37| especially if we've lowered this recall thing and everything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8617)|
| 2:23:40| But what I'm saying is, do you think 15 or 20 years from now, if they came up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8620)|
| 2:23:44| that we shouldn't be allowed to appoint them to a committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8624)|
| 2:23:48| Yes, I am saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8628)|
| 2:23:51| And I think that when they are ousted, it's not for just something minor or petty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8631)|
| 2:23:55| Again, if we are going to refer to Mr. Moore, he was ousted for perjury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8635)|
| 2:24:01| That's a very, very serious thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8641)|
| 2:24:07| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8647)|
| 2:24:10| You know this thing is directed toward one person and one situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8650)|
| 2:24:15| Ms. Broyles, if you were bringing something forward that was more broad-reaching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8655)|
| 2:24:21| I might believe that you were more genuine on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8661)|
| 2:24:25| But this is about one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8665)|
| 2:24:27| We have a person that serves on boards for Knox County, the Hilltop and Slope Protection Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8667)|
| 2:24:34| That's a joint Knox County-Knoxville City Task Force who has honorably served in their adulthood on the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8674)|
| 2:24:42| I disagree with this person emphatically politically, but they have served their community honorably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8682)|
| 2:24:48| despite the fact that they have been convicted of a drug offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8688)|
| 2:24:53| They actually went to prison for a drug offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8693)|
| 2:24:57| Now, I would say that if I was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8697)|
| 2:25:00| let's make it to where if you've ever been convicted of a drug offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8700)|
| 2:25:05| that you can never do anything for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| I would say that you would probably be raising canes saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8707)|
| 2:25:11| oh, no, oh, no, we've got a person who served honorably after turning their life around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8711)|
| 2:25:19| Mr. Moore has not been convicted of a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8719)|
| 2:25:22| He's not even been convicted of a misdemeanor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8722)|
| 2:25:26| This was a civil action that was taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8726)|
| 2:25:30| His removal was a civil action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8730)|
| 2:25:33| Now, I understand that probably he might choose not to serve on BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8733)|
| 2:25:39| That's his choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8739)|
| 2:25:40| He's been appointed to it, and if he wants to fill that term, it's his right to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8740)|
| 2:25:46| I can see reasons why he might choose to leave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8746)|
| 2:25:50| But the thing is for us to set an action here and say we're going to single out one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8750)|
