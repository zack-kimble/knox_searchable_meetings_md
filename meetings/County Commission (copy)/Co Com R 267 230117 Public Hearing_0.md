| 0:01:31| We do have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=91)|
| 0:01:34| Our staff has informed me that we do not have anyone signed up to speak to this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=94)|
| 0:01:40| Yes, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=100)|
| 0:01:42| I have Mr. Andrew Flores is here to speak on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=102)|
| 0:01:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| That's the only one I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=108)|
| 0:01:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=111)|
| 0:01:52| Mr. Flores, if you would please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=112)|
| 0:01:57| State your name and county of residence and you will have five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=117)|
| 0:02:03| It's Andrew Flores in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=123)|
| 0:02:07| I wanted to come forward and get some clarification on this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=127)|
| 0:02:13| My family and I may very well be, very soon, be using this particular ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=133)|
| 0:02:21| We are selling a house and moving deeper into south Knoxville, buying acreage, but we'll be building as a homeowner builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=141)|
| 0:02:29| And that may take some additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=149)|
| 0:02:32| So when we first were made aware of this ordinance, first off, I want to say thank you for whoever authored it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=152)|
| 0:02:39| because it gives us the ability to live on the land under certain circumstances without having to try to find temporary housing somewhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=159)|
| 0:02:47| which can be difficult in this market that we're in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| It's hard to find anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| But the things of clarification that I'm trying to, I guess, try to grasp are the permit process, how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=173)|
| 0:03:05| I know it states it, but there's a permit process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=185)|
| 0:03:12| The clarification on what is considered adequate cooking or adequate sanitation or adequate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=192)|
| 0:03:20| all the adequates I'm going to call them that are listed in the ordinance, clarification on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=200)|
| 0:03:26| What qualifies a camper to have those things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=206)|
| 0:03:32| The other aspect of it might be the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| I don't know if anybody has addressed the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| I'm not sure if it's in the ordinance or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| I did briefly read over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| My commissioner did send it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| I don't know that I saw anything on that, but wanted to see if there was any other information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=222)|
| 0:03:50| I do believe it's a good ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| Before, it was completely illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| I would not have known that had I not had my conversation with my commissioner, which is Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=236)|
| 0:04:04| But I do think there needs to be some clarification on that, at least for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| We're looking very quickly, maybe eight to ten weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| This will go into effect, hopefully, within time for us to complete what we're trying to do on our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=251)|
| 0:04:19| I think that is it, all the questions I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| Like I said, this clarification would be really great as I'm getting ready to march right into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=263)|
| 0:04:29| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| Andrew, go ahead and send me those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=276)|
| 0:04:43| Is that Mr. Snowden coming in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| Go ahead and send me those e-mails, and I'll get with Mr. Snowden, and we'll try to get you the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| Mr. Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| Mr. Flores?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| Yeah, just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| When you said what costs, what are you relating costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| I would assume that the permit has a fee associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| You can't just pull a permit with no fee, at least that's not consistent with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| I've never pulled a permit for anything that didn't have a fee associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| Just clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| Sorry, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| Mr. Flores, just wanted to point out, if you go to the commission website as an attachment of the public hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| there are some documents that give you the uses permitted and also the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| It's under planning commission information file, but there's also the ordinance in the Exhibit A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=338)|
| 0:05:44| and hopefully that will answer some of your questions or give you some starting information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| and then you can forward to Commissioner Daley any additional questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| But that could be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| Commissioner Daley did go ahead and forward Exhibit A to me, so I was able to read through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| Unfortunately, some of it is just not very clear, but that is how it is with ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| Oh, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=368)|

| 0:06:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230117-public-hearing?start=376)|
